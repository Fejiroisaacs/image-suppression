Aha! I knew Beck couldn't pay for that bed herself! (But still, if she's so desperate for cash, why waste this hard-won jackpot on a bedframe?) It is strongly implied that Beck has a sugar daddy situation, which it turns out she does, but like, literally. Which makes this both more and less gross than initially insinuated. If you were meeting your estranged dad at a Dickens Festival, would you really go shopping for your outfit at a lingerie store? Would you refer to your arrangement as ""whoring""? Would your aesthetic be 'Victoria's Secret pirate wench with Pinterest hair'?

But I digress. For at this juncture, Joe is spying on Beck's texts and has no idea who the Captain is. All he knows is that this sexual debut did not go as planned, and he bails without saying goodbye.

Cut to Peach, talking shit about her other friends - ""Annika wouldn't know a good dick if you hit her over the head with it,"" wow, okay - and encouraging Beck to practice self-love by ghosting Joe. Beck is distracted because everyone in her workshop called her writing ""treacly,"" which is just perfect. I want a crossover with Younger where Blythe gets a book deal with Millennial but insists on working exclusively with Charles because ""I feel like Kelsey doesn't appreciate my spare, incisive prose.""

Peach Salinger, who let's not forget is a descendant through some unclear means of a one J. D. Salinger, advises Beck cool it with writing so much about her dad in these thinly veiled ways and find other demons to focus on. ""I'm just saying, stop killing puppies. Write fresh!"" Actually, I love that advice. Points for Peach. (Also, she's a better friend than I realized if she's out here reading Beck's ""treacly"" rough drafts.) Beck lies to Peach about her weekend plans, pretending she has some writers' retreat to go to, and hypes herself for this sad motel with a mantra we would all do well to remember: Britney got through 2007 though, right?

Just as the Captain pulls up and we are about to find out his costume kinks, we are back to Joe. Joe, who has been spying on Beck from across the parking lot, is reliving his poor performance, moaning (not incorrectly) ""I've reduced myself to an anecdote"" and then, as he watches Beck report on the occasion to her friends, ""My dick reduced to cartoon food items."" In my notes I wrote: Did Joe BRING Beck's phone to her apartment?! Bold move buddy.

Anyway: The Captain is Beck's dad. Beck has been telling everybody her dad overdosed and died. We eventually discover Beck's dad overdosed and survived and ditched Beck's family to start fresh with a Christian mommy blogger, and rather than divulge this painful humiliation to the world - and, let's be real, because she wants to seem more interested and complex - Beck has been telling everybody that her dad is dead.

Now Beck grits her teeth through particularly degrading family rituals, like attending this Dickens Festival with dad's do-over family, so the Captain will keep sending her money. The snotty teen daughter, who looks absurd but frankly is much more appropriately attired for this even than Beck is, ""accidentally"" lets it slip that her mom and the Captain are having a baby, which means no more money for Beck.

Back at the ranch, Peach is doing recon on her missing copy of Ozma of Oz, which she just knows Joe stole. She swings by the bookstore, which is important because she meets my hero, Ethan, who describes undeniable bombshell Shay Mitchell thusly: ""Kinda hot, but that might just be a type thing.""

And then: Joe gets made at Dickens Fest! He smooth talks his way out of this by saying it's something he does annually as a bookseller. That's pretty clever, I must say. Beck buys it. I will also give credit to Joe - who is a psycho and a stalker and a murderer! #neverforget - for being self-effacing and quite charming about the other night. Beck's spot then gets blown up when the Captain strolls right up to her and introduces himself as her dad, because clearly he did not get the memo that he's supposed to be playing dead.

Beck explains her lie and Joe forgives and everybody goes to dinner in Great Expectations cosplay. As one might expect, it all goes sideways, with Christian Mommy Blogger accusing Beck of treating her dad like an ATM and Beck ranting right back, and Beck flees dramatically to a scenic gazebo, as one does.

""Do you want him dead"" Joe asks re: Beck's dad, and I am very intrigued by the idea of this show turning into a thing where Joe and Beck become hit-people together. But no, Beck just wants Joe to go and leave her ALONE with her issues and her 19th century strumpet dress.

The Captain finds her moping there and they have a pretty legitimate heart-to-heart, considering it begins with Beck informing him that she tells people he's dead. (All of that feels extremely fact-checkable, by the way - the Captain is on Facebook! But I guess a perk of having self-absorbed friends is that none of them will ever dig into your past.)

That night, Beck cannot sleep. But she can write. She does such a good job that Blythe reaches out to say the story gave her chills and she is, I quote, ""there for it."" Beck is there for this influx of validation, so she rushes to Joe's (horrid, terrifying) apartment and goes, ""They say girls with daddy issues are really good in bed,"" which, ugh. The best part of this sequence is that Joe's apartment is littered with all the stuff he's stolen from Beck and he has to strategically distract her with his mouth while his hands frantically stuff all the evidence between couch cushions. But WHERE IS OZMA OF OZ? Inquiring Peaches want to know!

Speaking of Peach: She has one of those ""I'm solving a mystery"" berets, a la Blair Waldorf, and she has bedbugs! Even wealth cannot protect you from bedbugs. NOTHING CAN PROTECT YOU. I need to level with you, this is extremely real for me as I am coming up on the five-year anniversary of my bedbug invasion. (You can find that nightmare fodder here.) So now I feel deeply connect to Peach Salinger, which is not a sentence I ever saw myself writing but life can be funny that way.

Joe, somehow, slipped the book back on Peach's shelf without anybody finding out. Do we think Joe picked up a bedbug on the way out? That's what you get for breaking and entering."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13334864/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"A teenager and her dads move into a forsaken home with a grim past. As the family makes renovations, a darkness takes root within them.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Loni Peristere'],"['', '']",[],['teenager'],[],"The teenager Scarlett is in the call with her parents, Michael and Troy, driving to their new home. They sing along with the radio, and a disgusted Scarlett begs them to stop, and they jokingly complain about her being a wet blanket. Scarlett texts back to her friend Shanti that they're almost at their new home. They get to the house and go inside, and Scarlett looks around the place.

Going back to her fathers, Scarlett tells them that she hasn't seen any ghosts yet. Troy says that ghosts don't exist, He talks about how popular the Haunted Mansion ride is at Disneyland, and how popular Halloween is in America, and people loved to be scared. Michael talks about how they'll renovate the place and turn it into a branded stay, and the couple isn't concerned about the fact that people died there. The men insist that neither of them believe in ghosts, and Scarlett says that she isn't frightened by the house and just liked their old house, and her parents assure her that they'll never be homeless and Scarlett's college is paid for. They share a group hug.

Once the men go upstairs to check out the second bedroom, Shanti texts Scarlett and Scarlett sarcastically says that she hopes the ghosts kill her. She goes to her new room to unpack, and a red ball rolls into the room and bumps her foot. There's nobody in the hallway, and a red ball rolls in again. There's still nobody there, and as Scarlett looks around in the hallway a door creaks open behind her. Scarlett peers into the closet revealed and finds a black rubber suit. She takes it takes it to her room and puts it on, and admires herself in the full-length mirror. Scarlett sees a reflection of a man wearing the same suit and quickly takes off the suit, then goes out of the house and tosses the suit in the garbage.

Later, Scarlett sits in her science class as the teacher talks about the amygdala being the part of the pain that regulates fear. When the teacher suggests that deadening the amygdala can stop other emotions, Scarlett says that it's easy not to be afraid, and people do it all the time, and shame stops people from doing what they want. The other girls giggle and figure Scarlett is feeling shame about something. Afterward, Scarlett goes to her locker and a girl from her class, Maya, jokingly says that Scarlett has been staring at her. Scarlett dismisses it as her not getting much sleep, and Maya says that she didn't say she didn't like it. Maya compliments Scarlett's smarts and walks off. Shanti comes over and asks what was going on, and Scarlett says that she thinks Maya was flirting with her.

Over lunch, Scarlett tells Shanti what Maya said. Shanti isn't convinced that Maya was flirting, and Scarlett insists that Maya was. Shanti figures that Maya was screwing with Scarlett, but Scarlett doesn't believe it. Her friend says that Scarlett desperately wants it to be real

That night at the house, Scarlett lies in her bed, imagines Maya in bed with her, and masturbates. Scarlett imagines strangling Maya, then climaxes. Later as she sleeps, the Rubberman appears above her as she sleeps. She wakes up from her nightmare screaming .

Scarlett sits in her bed and looks at Facebook photos of Maya. Maya texts Scarlett and says that her friends don't know a few things about her, and Scarlett texts that she's not officially out at school. Maya invites her to a sleepover, and says that she'll protect Scarlett from her bitchy friends. Then the two of them can together once the others are asleep. Scarlett smiles and agrees.

The next day, Michael and Troy are redecorating the house when Scarlett comes by. They have her sit down and talk to her and they've discovered that she's still looking at ""extreme"" porn on her computer, and she's moved on to more disturbing material. Scarlett angrily says that it's none of her business what porn she looks at, but they point out she's 16 and the level of pain and suffering that girls are suffering at the sites Scarlett visits is not good for her to see. Michael asks her if she imagines being the masochist or the sadist, and Scarlett refuses to talk to her parents about it. Troy says that they're going to have her see a therapist, and they figure it goes beyond normal. Her parents say that she's grounded the upcoming weekend, and Scarlett says that she has a slumber party to go to with Maya and her friends. Scarlett begs her parents not to ground her, and they give in but say the therapist, Dr. Ann Grant, will be at the house the next day. They tell her there's a difference between sex, and something dark and unhealthy.

At school in science class, Maya texts Scarlett and smiles at her. Back at home, Scarlett goes to her room, tries to bring up humiliation porn, sites, and discovers that her parents have locked her out. Her closet door opens on its own, revealing a Rubberman suit. Scarlett puts the suit on, her eyes turn black, and she picks up a knife. She goes to her parents' where Troy is running a bath, and comes in. Michael is on the bed reading, and calls Troy in. Scarlett giggles and removes the hood, and says ""Gotcha"". Her parents aren't amused, and she says that she threw the suit away but thought they put it in her closet. Michael says that they didn't, and Troy tells her to take it off and take a hot shower, and they never want to see it again. Scarlett says that she's keeping it, and angrily says that they can't control her mind and body. Troy tries to rip it off her and Scarlett accidentally cuts him on the arm with the knife. Michael binds the cut, and takes his husband to Urgent Care to get stitches. Troy tells Scarlett to go to her room, and won't be talking to her for weeks. Crying, Scarlett goes to her room.

The next day, the family meets with Grant at the house, and Scarlett wonders if the therapist is saying that she's a freak. Grant says that Scarlett isn't a freak, and they should explore the reasons for Scarlett' atypical behavior. Troy asks why Scarlett tried to scare them, and his daughter says, and Scarlett vaguely says that she thought it was funny. Michael admits that they prank each other all the time, and he tells Grant that they tend to be overprotective because when Scarlett was 3, she was kidnapped, when someone stole their car with her in it. A woman whose ex had murdered her own daughter found Scarlett and thought she was a replacement, and Scarlett doesn't remember the 10 days she was missing.

Grant worries most about the house, Scarlett's fathers insists the house isn't haunted, and Grant agrees. She figures that Scarlett has been ""possessed"" by the stories, and Grant feels the heaviness in the air when she came in. The time runs out for the session, and Grant says that she wants to see all of them in a week, as well as a separate session with just Scarlett. She goes to use the restroom before she goes, and Michael says that Scarlett isn't going to the slumber party. Scarlett curses both of them and blames them for moving into the house, wishes the kidnapper would have kept her, and storms out.

When Grant leaves the restroom, she finds a red ball on the floor. She sees and hears a child giggling and running off, and goes after them into the basement. A boy says that Grant is going to die there, and the Rubberman comes up behind her, cuts her throat, and Grant's body falls down the stairs into the basement.

That night, Michael finds the suit on the hallway floor, and a pool of blood nearby. He takes the suit to Troy and they burn it in the fireplace, and Troy points out that they don't know whose blood it was. They figure it was Scarlett's time of the month, and go to take Xanax and watch TV.

In her room, Scarlett gets a text from Maya and says that she's grounded because she accidentally stabbed her father. Maya tells Scarlett to sneak out if she's ""hardcore"", and Scarlett does so. At the slumber party, Maya talks about how they're fake and Scarlett agrees. Maya tells Scarlett that she doesn't conform to superficial standards like everyone else does. Nicole asks Scarlett if she's a ""lezzie"", and they talk about what makes a girl a virgin lesbian. Scarlett says that she snuck out, and Maya tells her that she needs to be wearing pajamas because it's a slumber party. She goes to get a pair of hers, and leads Scarlett off.

Maya takes Scarlett to her room and gives her a pair of her shorties, and Scarlett takes off her outer clothes to put them on. Admiring her, Maya says ""Wow"" and Scarlett says that she wore her undergarments for Maya. Maya helps Scarlett put on a pajama top then kisses Scarlett's neck. Scarlett turns and asks Maya if she's experimenting because she thinks she might be gay, and Maya says she's serious and wonders if it matters. They sit on the bed and kiss, and Scarlett says that she's a virgin. Maya admits that she is as well, and was hoping that Scarlett would show her what to do, or has watched porn. Scarlett says that the porn she watches wouldn't be helpful, and Maya promises she won't judge Scarlett if she goes into details. The younger girl says that she likes violent stuff, and Mays says that sounds hot and has Scarlett tell her more. Scarlett does so, and Shanti texts her telling Scarlett to stop, saying the girls area livestreaming the whole thing.

Scarlett sees a phone set up in the nearby bathroom, facing them, and opens the bedroom door to see the other girls looking at their phones and giggling. Scarlett runs out of the house and gets in her car, crying. She calls Shanti and asks how much everyone heard, and Shanti confirms that they heard the whole thing. Scarlett figures everyone thinks she's a pervert, and Shanti tells Scarlett not to look at the comments. The crying girl figures her life is over and hangs up, and drives off while the girls watch her from Maya's bedroom window.

At the house, Scarlett goes to her father's bedroom and tries to talk to them, but they're asleep. She kneels in the shower and turns the showerhead on, crying, then gets out and calls Maya. Maya tells her it was the most fun they had in weeks. Scarlett says that the fun isn't over yet, and she's going to end the night by killing herself. Maya doesn't believe her, but Scarlett insists that it's true and that she's going to leave a note stating very clearly that the girls are the reason why. She reminds Maya of the case at Rutgers and the men responsible were arrested. Maya, panicking, says that they were just messing around, and Scarlett says that if they're not all at her house in 30 minutes, she's going to do it. Scarlett hangs up and looks at the gimp suit next to her.

The girls drive to the house and the other girls are reluctant to go in, but Maya insists that they have to go in together. They go in and the front door slams shut behind them, and Maya's phone rings. It's a text from Scarlett, who tells them to go down to the basement. The door slams and locks behind them, and Maya figures Scarlett is probably filming it to embarrass them. The four girls go down the basement stairs and look around, and Maya tells Scarlett to come out. They look in a hole, and Infantata lunges out at them. The girls shriek and run, Maya first, and a figure in the rubber suits stabs Maya in the chest. The figure then kills the other three girls.

The figure removes her hood, revealing that she's Scarlett. The last girl, Rowena, isn't quite dead and begs Scarlett to stop. Scarlett finishes Rowena off with the knife.

The next day, Michael and Troy come in and find Scarlett patching up the shaft in one room. They tell her that she did a good job and Michael wonders why she's doing it. She says that she thought it would be a fun project to try, and apologizes about lying to them about browsing the S&M sites. Her fathers hug her and say they're sorry for not being good helping her with her feelings, and Scarlett says that at least they try. The men go down to breakfast, and Scarlett stays behind to tidy up. Before they go, their daughter tells them that she's a sadist, not a masochist. They tank her for that and go.

After they go, the ghost of Grant appears and tells Scarlett that they should have a session about what Scarlett has done. Scarlett says that she's good, and that she has never felt better in her life. The girl goes and finds Rubberman waiting for her in the hallway."

Running away, Gladys falls over a balustrade, lands at the bottom of the stairs, and breaks her leg in the fall. She limps away, and Ruby walks down and comes after Gladys. Gladys runs to the basement and Scarlett dressed as Rubberwoman stabs her repeatedly in the stomach, then looks at the arriving Ruby and smiles.

Later, Ruby and Scarlett take a bath together. Ruby says that her parents died when she was six, in a car crash. She was sent to live with her Uncle Tony. He was a sadist who eventually hurt her. Scarlett hugs Ruby and says that she's sorry, and Ruby says that on her 16th birthday Tony drove her to her parents, revealed they were still alive, and told her that they sold Ruby to him when they were done with her. Ruby says that she died inside when she saw them, and she decided to kill herself. She did it in the Murder House, knowing about the place's reputation, but she didn't know that if anyone dies there, they're stuck there forever. The realtor who was selling the house buried Ruby's body in the backyard so no one would find out and ruin the chances of the house being sold, Ruby asks Scarlett to come and be there with her, and Scarlett should kill herself so they can be together forever. When Scarlett hesitates, Ruby submerges herself completely in the bathwater then disappears.

Halloween comes, and detectives Juarez and Chapman come to the House. Scarlett sees them arrive, and the detectives arrive with Michael and Troy. The detectives explain that four girls went missing, and Troy says that they have nothing new to offer since the last time the detectives came by. The police got a warrant to check Scarlett' phone records, and have confirmed she called the girls an hour after the livestream. The girls' Snapchat tracking shows they all drove there together, and about 20 minutes later their phones stopped transmitting. Chapman suggests someone drove the girls' car back to Maya's house and walked back. The fathers don't believe Scarlett was involved.

When Juarez suggest the men were involved, Troy says that they're not talking to them further without their lawyer present. As the detectives go, Juarez says they'll be in touch. Once the detectives leaves, Scarlett comes down from her room and her fathers asks if there's something she wants to tell them. The girl insists that she didn't hurt the four girls, and suggests maybe the ghost killed them.

That night, Scarlett is on her bed clutching the knife and hears the ghosts whispering for her to join them. Grant appears and says that they had a session, and death hasn't stopped her ambition. Maya and the others kill Grant and Maya points out that Scarlett can't kill them again. Their leader, Maya, says that they can torment Scarlett for a long time and make sure she doesn't sleep at night. Ruby comes in and throws her knife past the girls, and says that they're not going to do anything. She tells them to stay away from Scarlett, and intimidated, they leave. Scarlett grabs Ruby and kisses her, and they slip to the floor together.

Two months later, Michael, Troy, and Scarlett meet with Grant--unaware that she's a ghost--and tell her that Scarlett still hasn't gotten over the girls' disappearance. Michael saw one of the ghosts, Pig Man, He ran and got Troy, but the time they got back the ghost had disappeared. Michael figures that Troy was hallucinating, and Scarlett points out that they've been fighting for the last month. Troy figures that Michael is pretending the House is haunted to get him to sell it so they can move out, Michael points out that they're going broke from their investment in the House. Grant suggests to Troy that it might be time to reconsider his dream, but Troy isn't convinced. Michael admits that he's scared and says they're all in danger, and wonders if the stories about the House are true. Troy figures Michael is trying to get Grant to validate his concerns, and Michael says Grant was here when he got home. Grant calls an end to the session and says she'd like to meet with them in a week, and sees herself out. Scarlett tells her fathers that she likes it there, and likes the pain inflicted there.

Later, Troy takes contractor Adam around the House and says that they've been doing the work on it themselves, using Youtube videos. He takes Adam upstairs to the second bedroom and shows him around, and dismisses the family's work. Adam says that they're not saving any money, and Troy admits that he's been dipping into Scarlett's college Fund. He begs Adam to help them, and says that Adam had a shirtless photo on Angie's List. Michael comes in, and Troy introduces Adam to him. When Michael points out that they don't have the money to pay Adam, and sarcastically tells Troy that a couple of blowjobs won't make up the difference. Adam says that he'll come back and give them a rough estimate later, and says that he can find a way to make it work for all of them. Troy agrees and Adam leaves, and Michael tells Adam that he's cruel, getting off on hurting people. He's known it all along, but says that Troy has never turned his cruelty on him before. Michael says that Troy flirting with Adam in front of him is an act of violence towards their marriage. Troy says that he needs some fun since his husband started ""cavorting with the dead"", and Michael tells him that their marriage is in trouble, and need to get out of the House. Troy says that they're over their heads and need to hire Adam to finish the job, and afterward they'll have a talk about where their marriage is going. Ruby is secretly listening to the two men talk.

Later, Troy and Adam have sex and Troy tells his partner that it has to be their secret, and Michael can't know. Adam says that he just got out of a bad relationship with a woman and can sympathize with Troy, and Troy says that Michael is apparently losing his mind and he can't stand his spouse anymore. He says that Michael's negativity is the issue, and Adam tells Troy that he should have as much sex with him as possible, to distract him until the job is done. They kiss, and they're interrupted when Adam's underline Martin calls to him.

Michael is in the second room examine the covered-over crawlspace, and Martin brings Troy and Adam in and says that judging from the stench, there's a dead raccoon walled up in the crawlspace. Adam breaks down the bricks and finds the girls' rotting corpses where Scarlett hid them. Michael and Troy said they had no idea, and Adam bashes in Martin's skull and says that the three of them are in it together. He says that he has a couple of outstanding lawsuits against him and a divorce, and might have stolen some client funds. Michael wants to all the police, but Troy stops him. Adam suggests they put Martin in the crawlspace with the other corpses, put some lime in, and wall them all over. He figures then they'd be partner, and he likes the haunted B&B idea. Michael agrees as long as Adam stays away from their marriage, and Adam says that he wants in on that as well. When Michael refuses, Adam tells Troy to tell Michael, and Michael demands the truth. Troy says that he screwed Adam and the two spouses get into a shoving match.

Michael throws Adam out, but they find Rubberman at their door. He kills Adam, and Michael and Troy run to Scarlett's room and confirm that she's not there. Michael is sure Scarlett wasn't in the suit, and they to the back door but find the ghosts of Martin and the girls waiting for them. They run out of the house, but find themselves back in the house. Michael hugs Troy and says that he's sorry, having worked out that Ruby killed them both. Ruby comes in and watches the couple as they hug.

Scarlett come home from school looks around for her dads, and finds the opened crawlspace. The ghosts of Adam and Martin confront her, and Scarlett runs out and finds her dead fathers in their bedroom. Their ghosts are sitting nearby and say that they need to talk. Scarlett runs out and closes the door, and Ruby stops her and tells her that it's okay, and now Scarlett has no excuse not to stay.

Michael and Troy talk to Grant, who says that being murdered is a very traumatic experience and that's why they don't remember being murdered. The therapist says that it's traumatic, and the couple repressed the memory as a coping mechanism. Troy is less than thrilled that they're trapped in a prison of more of the same. Grant is happy that she's working with the other therapist there on a book to help all of them, and Michael asks how Scarlett feels about everything that's happening. Scarlett figures that no one is going to hurt her there, particularly Ruby, and admits that Ruby is her girlfriend and killed her fathers to keep them there. Her parents aren't happy, and Scarlett points out that she can come and go as she wishes. She goes to get ready for a Halloween party, and Troy wants the name of the other therapist in the House.

In her room, Scarlett puts on the rubber suit, and sees Ruby behind her in the mirror. When Scarlett turns, there's no one there. Then Ruby appears again and says that she can go with Scarlett on Halloween. They kiss and leave, while the girls watch them go and wonder if they should spend their one free night of the year getting revenge on Scarlett for killing them.

Scarlett and Ruby go the party at Griffith Park, and Scarlett figures that if Ruby hadn't killed her dad, they would probably have gotten a divorce. Scarlett assures Ruby that she's the love of her life, and being together with her eternity sounds like heaven. She admits that she might not be ready to give up the world yet, and makes Ruby promise not to rob her of that choice. Ruby promises and they kiss, and Ruby says that she wants to have a non-stop orgy of trouble and pain.

The two girls dance, and Shanti finds Scarlett and figures Ruby is the reason Scarlett never texts her back anymore. Ruby tells Shanti that she's boring, and Shanti runs off. When Scarlett objects, Ruby admits that she's possessive and Scarlett runs after Shanti. Scarlett finds Shanti, alone and crying, and Shanti tells Scarlett that Scarlett was her only friend and then the girls disappeared. When Scarlett admits that she used that an as excuse to not come back to school, Shanti suggests that she might be a psychopath. Scarlett insists that she's trying to protect Shanti from her home life, and Shanti says she already figured out that Scarlett killed the girls. She needed Scarlett to talk to her about all of it, and she told the cops she didn't think Scarlett could do anything bad but that was a lie, and figures Scarlett is capable of anything. Shanti says that she doesn't want Scarlett in her life anymore, and Scarlett walks off.

The girls approach the crying Shanti, and Maya tells Shanti that she should have told the police about Scarlett. When they prepare to whip her to death, Ruby arrives and tells them to stop or she'll peel their faces off every day for the next thousand years. The four girls back off, and Ruby tells Shanti that the girls won't bother her again. Shanti tells Ruby that if Ruby loved Scarlett, she'd set her free. With that, she walks off.

Scarlett walks through one of the haunted walk-thrus, and finds Ruby killing two men. Ruby invites Scarlett to join in, and Scarlett draws a knife and advances on her victim. The girls come in and kill the victim, and tell Ruby that if they kill Scarlett outside of the House, Ruby will be stuck without Scarlett forever. Scarlett runs out, Nicole chasing her. Nicole's living boyfriend William sees her and calls to her, and she hugs him.

Scarlett hides, ready to stab anyone who comes after her. Ruby appears and walks Scarlett home, and says that she and the other three girls went at it all night, but she finally defeated them. Scarlett prepares to tell Ruby something, just as Maya and the others arrive. They back off when they realize Scarlett is telling Ruby something about going back into the house.

Maya admits they were awful and lets Scarlett to go inside and get her things, and say goodbye to her dads. Nicole and William come up and hug, and Nicole asks William to tell the police where their bodies are, but he should never come inside. Ruby tells William to tell the police that she killed Nicole and the others, so Scarlett won't be blamed.

As Scarlett packs, Michael asks her where she'll go. She says that she's not sure, and maybe she'll go aboard with the cash from their 401Ks. Scarlett asks if they're going to be okay, and Michael figures they don't have any more stress about money or the future so they'll do fine. They all hug goodbye and Scarlett walks out.

Ruby is waiting for Scarlett at the front door, and they hug and Scarlett tells Ruby that she's the only person in her life whose suffering brings her no pleasure. Ruby says the same and they kiss. Scarlett smiles and walks out the front door,

10 Months Later

Scarlett is in a car on the highway. She calls Ruby, who is having breakfast to the other ghosts. Ruby picks up and says that everything is going fine, and Troy reminds Scarlett that Halloween is in two months, and he and Michael are going are gladiators. Scarlett tells Ruby that she found Tony and she's going to torture and kill him for Ruby. They exchange sentiments of love, and Scarlett goes to Tony's house wearing the rubber suit and carrying a hammer.

Chad tries to unbutton Kelley's pants, but she pushes his hand away. She says that she's not comfortable, and figures that they don't have to rush it. Chad asks if it's him, and Kelly assures him that it it's not him but she just likes to take her time. He points out that she didn't wait when she with her former boyfriend, and she takes offense and goes home.

The next day, Chad goes to the skate park with his friends Milo and Quinn, and talks about what happened. They suggest Chad take Kelly to a drive in movie to get her in the mood, and the people restoring a local drive in got a copy of Rabbit Rabbit, the most infamous cursed film in cinema history. It was only shown once in '86, and six people were dead after the screening was over. The survivors said the audience went crazy, and the director was dragged before Congress and all the prints were destroyed. One of Chad's snagged tickets to the limited showing,

Back at home in her room, Chad watches video of the hearing with the director, Larry Bitterman. Tipper Gore questions Bitterman about how he claimed his movie would destroy people's souls. Bitterman says that he was promoting his movie, and Gore says she got a letter from Bitterman's studio saying they were going to pull the movie and destroy every print in existence. The director goes berserk and attacks Gore, and the guards pull him away.

At school, Kelley talks to her friend Dee about her relationship with Chad, and Dee friend suggests that Kelley is afraid of sex. Dee goes over to talk to her boyfriend, Milo, and Chad comes over to Kelley, apologizes for pressuring her into sex, and invites her to the drive in.

That night at the drive in, Rabid Ruth is outside the fence protesting against the movie. The manager Verna is more worried about how the delivery man hasn't arrived with the print, and the one screening will put them in the black. If they have to give refunds, they'll go broke.

Chad and Kelley pull in, and Chad figures Ruth is a promotional gimmick. After parking, they go to the snack bar. Milo and Quinn are there and they all talk about the movie. Dee is at the snack bar, and Kelley goes on ahead to get some snacks. The deliveryman arrives with the print and takes it to projection booth, and Ruth comes to the nearby fence and calls Chad over. He goes, and Ruth tells him to cut the power and stop the movie. She says that she was there in '86, and halfway through the movie her boyfriend was dead and she lost her eye, and her boyfriend ripped her eye out and swallowed it. Kelley comes over and asks for help, and Chad goes with her.

Verna sets up the projector, and the deliveryman looks over her shoulder and gives her projecting advice. She says that she doesn't need it, and the deliveryman leaves. The movie starts up and in the car, Chad tells Kelly what Ruth said to him. Chad figures Ruth wasn't a plant, and Kelley admits she's a little scared and puts her head on Chad's shoulder. She tells Chad that she wants to make that night special and kisses him.

Dee is in a car with Milo, giving him a blowjob. The movie starts and Dee looks up at the screen.

Kelley and Chad kiss, and Kelley looks up and at the screen. Chad tells her to forget the movie.

Verna watches the screen from the booth.

Through the drive in, people stare at the screen in fascination, their eyes turning bloodshot. Meanwhile, Ruth sneaks up to the booth and heads for the projector's power cord.

Chad hears a scream and points it out to Kelley, then looks over at a nearby car that's shaking.

The usher, Tillis, comes in and asks Ruth what she's doing there. Verna turns, her face laced with veins, and throws Ruth to the floor. The owner drives a pair of scissors into Ruth's remaining eye, then gets up and charges at Tillis.

Dee bites off Milo's penis and spits it out, her face distorted. She then lunges at him.

Kelley figures it's a joke like Ruth. Someone breaks through the window on Chad's side, and Chad grapples with his attacker back while Kelley drives the car off. Chad finally kicks his opponent out, and Kelley slams into other cars and Dee jumps on the hood. Kelley stares at her friend in shock, and slams into the snack booth's wall, crushing Dee. Chad tells his girlfriend they have to go, and they run inside as more of the now-frenzied patrons chase after them. The couple run up to the booth and close the door behind them, and they see Ruth's and Tillis' bloody corpses on the floor. Their faces are chewed off, and the landline is dead while they don't have their phones. Looking out the window, Chad sees the berserkers chasing down and killing anyone that isn't affected, flipping over cars.

Verna attacks Kelley as Kelley finds some shotgun shells, and Chad beats Verna in the head with a movie reel and beats her head until she's dead. He stops the movie but it's too late, Chad dozes off and wakes up the next morning. Kelley has been watching and tells Chad that a lot of the afflicted ran off, She figures the police won't believe them, and reminds Chad that Milo said there was going to be another screening that night. Since the print came from Bitterman, she figures they have to find him and get the second print.

Kelley has found the shotgun that goes with the shells, and Chad takes the scissors from Ruth's eye socket. They go out and Kelley looks at her dead friend's corpse on the car hood. Quinn, afflicted, comes slowly at them and Chad can't get through to him. When Quinn lunges at him, Chad stabs him in the chest with the scissors, and tells Kelley they have to hunt Bitterman down.

The couple track Bitterman down by the delivery receipt. The former director is living in a trailer in the desert, with a limo parked next to it. Inside, Bitterman is watching a newscast about the chaos, and he says that he made cinema history. The couple come in and confront Bitterman, explaining that they were at the screening. Kelley says that they want the other print, and Bitterman claims that he only has one print. Bitterman realizes that they weren't paying attention to the movie and that's why they're unaffected, and asks them to describe what happened. When they do, Bitterman is thrilled that everyone watching was affected. He says that it was a cinematic experience, where the horror is the audience.

Bitterman tells them about the subliminals in 'The Exorcist', which caused viewers to throw up. He was the second assistant editor and was partially responsible, but the movie didn't win an Oscar that year. Bitterman took it to the next level and raised money for his own movie, learned everything he could about subliminals, and put it into 'Rabbit Rabbit'. When his editor Lanie saw the finished product, she cut her own fingers off They put her away, blaming drugs and overwork, but Bitterman knew his subliminals worked. He released the movie in one special venue, and the audience went berserk. Gore turned her attention to Bitterman and had the movie banned, and had Bitterman sent to prison for 15 years on assault charges. Bitterman spent his time in prison perfecting his technique, and when he got out he applied it to a work print he had hidden away.

The director tells the teenagers to appreciate the big picture, and that they were witnesses to history. Kelley shoots Bitterman in the knee, and Chad knows that the movie at the drive in was a copy, so Bitterman must still have the original. When Kelley threatens him with the shotgun, Bitterman tells them where the original is. Chad destroys the print on the oven burner, and the couple walk out as the trailer explodes from the flames right after Bitterman yells that his name will go down in history.

The couple go back to Chad's bedroom and have sex. 'Rabbit Rabbit' airs on Netflix as Bitterman, and outside, the city burns as people go berserk."

5 Days Till Christmas

The Bros hang out at ""Suicide Bridge"" in LA until a jumper comes along. Barry wants to call the police, but Zinn says that the police would never get there in time so they should record. Barry films it all while the others chant ""Bro House"", and the man jumps. Zinn figures it's an easy million-subscriber spike, and wants to post it despite Barry's objections that they might get a backlash.

That night, there's a party at the Bro House. Zinn wants to post the video, but Barry still is unhappy with the whole thing. Zinn insists that they have to up the content to get the views, and makes Barry promise to get his mojo back. Barry agrees, and Zinn rides a skateboard down the stairs and then jumps onto a Christmas tree below. The suicide video goes up and the guests, disgusted, walk out.

The next day, Zinn tells the others that they're down followers and people are posting to complain. Barry says that there's an online petition to get Bro House shut down, and the dead man's family is holding a press conference later that day to denounce them. He suggests that they make an apology video, but Zinn refuses, figuring they'll be accused of being fake and get more hate. Zinn figures they have to ""go gay."" James agrees, but Barry warns that it smells like another train wreck and Wyatt agrees with him. Workers from their sponsor, Kraken Energy Drinks, pull up and start taking away the items they sent the Bros. Zinn figures that they'd better go gay.

Soon the Bros are doing ""gay things"", saying ""no homo"" after each one. Wyatt keeps saying he's ""no homo"" to get it on the record,"" and they lick spilled ice cream off of James' chest. They still keep losing subscribers, and girls mock them as they drive by them on the streets. Barry suggests they ""get back to their roots"" by doing dumb stuff. Zinn agrees, and says that they should out during Christmas and act goofy.

The Bros go to a mall and they go up to a mall Santa. They say that they're getting into the Bro House Christmas spirit, go up to the Santa elf assistant, and asks if they were the ones who filmed the suicide. and ask her sexual questions about elves and Santa. Another little person elf comes over and tells them to turn off their phones and leave, and threatens to call security. The Bros go up to Santa and Zinn announces that Santa isn't real. Santa tells them to leave now, and Zinn twerks him. The mall Santa knocks Zinn down and says that he'll get what he deserves, and the Bro run when security approaches.

Christmas Eve

At the Bro House, the Bros check their released video. Wyatt claims that things got a little crazy, and tells Barry that he might not be Bro House material. James says that Barry keeps the whole thing running, but Wyatt continues. Zinn says that they're good friends, and they can't let anything tear them apart. They lose more followers, and Wyatt says that he can't go back to living with his parents. Detective Deana Gibbs from Homicide/Robbery calls and says that she needs to talk to the Bros about Santa. The man hired for the job was someone else, and they found him murdered in his apartment. Gibbs wants the Bros to come down the police station the next morning and give a statement. She wants a copy of the video Barry was recording. The real mall Santa was chopped to pieces and put in a present box.

Wyatt goes out to the garage to get beers. There's a camera taped to the back of the refrigerator interior, and Santa grabs him from behind, beats his heat into the top of the refrigerator, then twists Wyatt's head around 180 degrees on his neck.

Zinn tell James and Barry about Gibbs' call, and how Santa goes around killing mall Santas and taking their places. Barry brings up their video and figures Santa didn't look right, and someone uploads a video of Wyatt's murder to their account. James figures that Wyatt is pranking them, and Zinn goes to talk to Wyatt while Barry deletes the video from their account. Before he can, they get likes. Barry continues deleting it, and tells James that it's sick. However, it gets reposted and Barry doesn't know who. The same person posts a link to a tabloid webpage, with the ""truth"" about Claus.

Zinn goes out to the garage and the refrigerator rattles. He opens the door but the camera is gone.

Barry reads the article at the link, which says that the legend of Claus is based on tales of the wild man, a pagan nature god who wore animal skins and had a hideous painted face. The wild man was a fierce hunter who punished those who were bad, and Brought more than presents.

Zinn goes outside looking for Wyatt, and finds Santa waiting for him. Santa just stares at Zinn, then takes out an animal thigh bones and beats Zinn down. Barry and James hear Zinn's screams, and Barry figures Zinn and Wyatt are pranking them.

Santa wraps Zinn in the house's Christmas lights and tosses him into the pool, where he's electrocuted. The lights in the house go out, and James wonders if it's Santa. They look out in the pool and see Zinn's body, and James goes to call 911. The police say they're sending a car, and the two Bros go out to their car. A video of Zinn's murders goes to Barry's phone, and they go the front door but hear Santa pounding on the outside, and recorded Christmas songs playing. They hug and go out to their car, and Santa shoots them with candy canes from a crossbow. He pins James' hand to the hood, shoots Barry in the leg, then shoots James in the head.

Barry crawls back in the house and locks the front door behind him. He gets to the fireplace and pulls the cane out of his leg, discovers the phone line is dead, and hears Santa on the roof. Barry's laptop chimes, and he sends out a message begging for help. but everyone thinks that it's a prank. Barry sees ash sifting down from the chimney, and crawls over and tries to close the grate. Santa pours gasoline down, which lands on Barry, and the computer shows the Bro House has hit five million subscribers. Barry is thrilled that they did it, just as Santa tosses a lit match down, setting Barry on fire. Running out to the pool, Barry jumps in but it's too late for him.

The next morning the police and fireman arrive at the house. Gibbs find their Christmas tree decorated with the hacked up parts of the Bros' body.

A mall Santa is leaving his mall, drinks, and gets into his car. Santa is watching from his truck, and chuckles."

Liv says that she wants to be pregnant, and wants to feel their baby growing inside of her. Matt says that they'll keep trying, and Mound warns that the chances of success decrease with each attempt while the cost increases, and they should be prepared. Asa the couple leaves, Matt tells Liv that they'll keep trying. One he goes, the receptionist Bernadette tells Liv that Matt is a keeper. Bernadette says that she's watch Liv visiting for two years, and shows Liv a Sumerian fertility totem. She tells Liv to place it under her bed during intimacy, and Liv will get a baby. Bernadette says that it's been in her family for a long time, and it's the reason she's there. She assures Liv that she can keep it as long as she likes, and Liv takes it.

That night at home, Liv places the totem beneath her bed. Matt comes to bed and talks about how he gets a better part, and Liv says that she just inherited her money instead of earning it. He says that he's serious about how they'll keep trying, and she stuck with his acting career and he'll stick with her about the baby. They kiss and make love, while it storms outside.

16 Months Later

Liv and her nanny Norma are tending to Liv's baby. The baby is crying despite Liv's efforts to calm him, Matt hasn't gotten back from his current acting job yet, and Norma nanny manages to quiet the baby. Liv complains that she doesn't know how to ""operate"" her own baby, and says that it's like he doesn't even want to be around her. She snaps, saying that becoming a mother was a mistake.

That night, Liv sees static on the baby monitor, and thinks she hears someone in the house. There's no one there, and she looks under the bed and finds the overturned totem. She takes it out and angrily ""thanks"" it for everything. and puts it in a box in the closet. Liv coms out and is startled by Matt in a corpse mask. He says that they told him to keep it on, and he has to be back at the set in two hours. Matt tells Liv that Norma called him and wanted him to check on Liv. Liv complains that Matt keeps working at night and isn't concerned about her, He takes off the mask and tells his wife that he doesn't want to live off her money, and Liv feels like she's losing it because she sucks at being a mom. Matt assures her that she doesn't, and that she has the hard job. He tells her that what she's experiencing is completely normal, and says that she should talk to a MD in postpartum disorders.

That night in bed, Liv hears the baby crying over the monitor. She sees a demon on the monitor, standing over the baby's crib, and goes to the nursery. The closet door is open and Liv hears growling from inside. When she looks in, there's nothing there. The monitor tablet in her hand shows the demon standing behind her, but when she turns there's nothing there.

Later, Liv meets with the MD, Eleanor Berger, and tells her what happened. Berger dismisses it as imagination, and Liv says that it's nice talking to someone who has been through the same thing. She wonders if it's possible for a baby to hate its mother, and she can't calm it down but everyone else can. Berger suggests the baby is picking up on Liv's stress, but says that a baby can't hate its mother. However, the MD says that it's not crazy to get that feeling. She suggests that Liv hire a night nurse for a few weeks until Liv's hormones level off, but Liv refuses. Berger agrees but says they can start off with some ""new agey"" techniques.

Later at home, Liv is giving her baby son, Aaron, a detox bath and talking to him and laughing. She then puts Aaron in his crib and goes out. Matt comes home to find Liv in the kitchen, and she points out on the monitor that Aaron isn't crying anymore and the baths Berger recommended are working. Liv has already made him coffee for his audition, and she thanks him for finding Berger for her. Aaron starts crying, and Liv tells Matt that she's got it, and he should go. Once Matt goes, Liv goes into the nursery and calms down Aaron, and finds the totem in a corner of his crib. It's taken on a more detailed demonic form, and she confirms that it's not where she put it. She asks Norma if she put it in Aaron's crib, and Norma crosses herself and says that she can't work there.

Liv hears growling coming from the basement, and goes downstairs. She finds scratch marks on the wall, and a torn apart duct nearby. A board falls down, scratching her arm with a protruding nail. Liv shows Matt the totem when he comes home, and he says that it looks Satanic. He asks where Liv got it, and she claims she got it at a new age store. Matt figures that a raccoon got caught in the basement, but Liv doesn't believe it and her husband wonders if she's talking about a ghost. He suggests that Liv is very tired and she's imagining things. Liv tells him that he doesn't have to worry about her, and he says that the show wants him back for an actual part. However, they're shooting nights and he can't do it if she's freaking out. Matt wants a reason from her not to worry, and Liv assures him that she's okay.

That night, Liv is in her bed using her laptop to an Internet search on Sumerian totems. She finds photos of the one like she had, and about how they're connected to the demon Ba'al, the Lord of the Flies. She sees Ba'al on the monitor and goes to the nursery, but all that's there is Aaron crying in his crib. She caresses him briefly and then goes out. Listening at the monitor, Liv hears a male voice and records it.

The next morning, Liv plays the recording for Matt. She speeds it up and they hear a voice saying ""I want him"". Screaming, she tries to make it clearer. Matt brings Berger over and she listens to the recording. She dismisses it as Liv's mind making connection, and says that she doesn't hear anything. Berger insists that Liv isn't thinking clearly because of lack of sleep, and Liv should accept that so she can move forward. The MD proscribes Zoloft, and later Liv takes some.

Matt has his fellow actors and friends from their college film department over for dinner, and they toast his success. One of his friends sees a nearby Ouija board and suggests they try it, and the others agree. Matt is leery, but Liv is with them and says that it's okay. They set up the board and puts their fingers on the planchette. It moves on its own, spelling out ""JACK MEHOFF"". One of them snickers at his joke, and the planchette moves again,, spelling out ""HEISMINE"". Liv backs away in terror, saying that ""he"" means Aaron, and throws the board across the room. She says that there's something in the house, and it wants their son. Matt say that it's crazy, but she says that they need to do something about the demon and runs out of the room. She goes to the nursery with Matt following her, complaining that she embarrassed her in front of his friends. Matt says he can't deal with her depression anymore, and tells her to do what she has to do but figure her shit out. Liv curses him and goes to the nursery, comforting Aaron who is crying, apparently because of the storm outside. She sees Ba'al outside the window, and tells him that he'll never get her baby.

Later, Bernadette goes to her car in the fertility clinic's parking garage. Liv approaches her with the totem and says that now Ba'al wants the baby back, She wants Bernadette to tell her how to get rid of Ba'al. Bernadette takes Liv to her apartment and says that Ba'al is a fertility god, not a demon, and one of her collected grimoires has a banishment spell. She says that her parents dabbled in the sacred arts, and she's been into paganism since it turned her life around from drug use. Bernadette insists that she only gave Liv the totem to help, and finds the banishment spell. She gives Liv a ritual dagger she bought and tells Liv to follow the ritual.

That night at her home, Liv performs the ritual, dribbling her blood on the totem while chanting. When Matt comes up behind her, a startled Liv stabs the dagger into his chest.

Two Weeks Later

Liv is in a sanitarium, and Matt comes to see her. They hug and apologizes for stabbing him, and he tells her that she didn't mean to do it and it's in the past. Matt says that Aaron is good, and tells Liv that she doesn't have to stay there. Liv says that she's not coming home until Berger says that it's safe, and won't leave until she gets a handle on everything. Matt tells her that he's there for her, and he loves her.

Matt goes to his car where Bernadette is waiting inside, and they kiss. He tells her that once his lawyers get done with, he'll have Liv committed for good. Bernadette is glad to get rid of the fake occult books. Later, Matt and Bernadette have a party with all their friends, who were in on it and set up the whole Ouija board scene. Matt's friends set up all the sound effects and scratches, one of them wore a Ba'al costume, and substituted her Zoloft for psychoactives. Matt says that when all of Liv's money is his, he'll pay them off. Aaron starts crying, and Matt says that he deliberately made himself infertile bur still impregnated Liv.

Matt goes to check on Aaron, while the lights flicker in the room where the others are. The friends hear growling, and fog pours into the room. Ba'al appears and kills all of them. Matt hears them screaming, goes to the room, and finds their corpses and Ba'al killing Bernadette.

Later, Matt is locked up as a murderer. Liv comes to see him and says that he's a bastard. Matt told the police everything, and he didn't want kids but Liv didn't listen. He wanted her money, and he insists that he didn't kill his friends for the money even though the police think he did. Matt insists that it was Ba'al, and Liv tells him that she's not going to listen to it from him He begs Liv for his help, and needs money for an attorney. Liv refuses to help him, says that Aaron doesn't have a father, and walks out.

Back at home, Liv holds Aaron and says that it's the two of them against the world. Ba'al appears and tells Liv to release him now that he's killed the others. Liv says that Bernadette gave her a real banishing spell even though Bernadette didn't believe it, and Liv cast it in the hospital. She summoned Ba'al and sent him to kill Matt' friend and frame Matt.

Liv agrees to release Ba'al as long as he gives her another son."

When Jay insists on calling his law firm to check in, Addy reminds him that they had agreed that work was off-limits during their trip. He says that it's about experiencing nature, and getting outside of their comfort zones. Jacob says that he's rather have TV then go camping.

The family enters Kern Canyon National Park and drives back into the wood. They pull to a lake and Jay sets the camp up. That night, Addy puts Jacob to bed while Jay relaxes and drinks, unaware that someone is watching the campsite from the nearby woods.

Once Jacob falls asleep, Jay and Addy go into the son and look at their sleeping son. They kiss, and then hear something howling in the distance. Jay dismisses it and they make love, while a shadow of something passes by outside.

The next morning, Jay gives Jacob his old Boy Scour compass before the two of them go fishing. Back at the camp, Addy comes out of the latrine tent and sees a trail of blood on the ground. She follows it into the forest and finds a dead deer hanging in a tree. Meanwhile, Jacob runs ahead of his father, going out of sight. Jay discovers that his son has vanished Addy runs up and Jay tells her what happened, and the panicked parents look for their son.

Ten Years Later

A drunken Jay has passed out from drinking while looking at clippings about his son's disappearance. Someone pounds on the door, waking him up, and he answers it. A man, Bob Birch, is there and says that they need to talk. Birch says that he has information about Jacob, and Jay lets Birch in. Jay explains that people think he killed Jacob, and make threatening phone calls and slash his tires. Birch says that he's a hunter leading tours into the woods, and that he's an eyewitness. He shows Jay a photo from a photo trap he hung up, and he found the compass nearby. The photo shows a boy about the same age that Jacob would be after ten years, and Birch explains that the part of the park where Jacob has been overrun by some of the cartel farms, and some of the cartel members abduct people as leverage. The photo was snapped where they operate, and Birth offers to take Jay there in return for expenses and nothing more. He says that Jay will have to talk to the growers separately.

Jay goes to see Addy and tells her what Birch told him. She figures that Birch is fishing for money and it's a scam, and Addy won't look at the photo again, for fear of the hope she has and is crushed each time they find a possible clue but it turns out to go nowhere. Addy tells him to find something to do, and that she can't teach anymore, and insists that Jacob is gone for good. Jay shows her the compass, and says that he can't ignore it but he doesn't have the money. Addy curses him and goes to get the money.

At the park, Birch takes Addy and Jay to the Malvados area of the park, where the camera snapped the photo, and says that they need to be at the growers' camp before sunset. Birch leads them through the forest to the camp, Jay asks what Rob thinks of what's happened, and Addy tells him that she and Rob split up. He says that he wanted to catch up with Addy, and she says that Rob wanted to start a family but she didn't want another. Jay tells her that she implied that she wanted their divorce, and she insists that she never blamed Jay for Jacob's disappearance. He needed to believe that she did. Birch comes over and tells them to work out their problem later, and they need to keep moving. They continue into the word, and someone watches them from hiding.

Birch tells them that a ranger's station ahead, but the ranger who runs it is fucked up and they should avoid conversation. Birch goes in with Jay, while Addy stays behind to get water from a pump. Jay thinks he's something out in the forest, but dismisses it as nothing. Meanwhile the ranger, Stan Vogel, approaches Addy and asks which way her group is heading. Jay and Birch come over, and Addy says that they're just getting out of the city. Vogel recognizes Birch, who says that he's running another tour. Vogel doesn't believe them and Jay agrees, and says that they're there to find their son. The ranger says that he recognizes them from the news, and Jay says that they believe Jacob is alive and they're heading up into the Malvados.

Vogel says that the Malvados is nowhere to go, and there are things there a million times worse than the growers. Addy asks for more details, and Vogel says that he had only been in the country a couple of months, and was at the station when Jacob went missing. He saw footprints around the station, and something apparently attacked him and then walked off, carrying something. Jay tells Addy that they can't buy into it, and Birch says that they either move immediately or lose the sun. Vogel tells Addy to go back the way she came.

The group continues on, and Addy mentions the deer she found hanging from the tree just before Jacob disappeared. Birch says that in the 20+ years he's been hunting in the park, he's never seen anything he can't explain. When Birch says that Addy is nuts for believing Vogel's claim, Jay tells the hunter not to talk to his ex-wife like that and walks past Birch.

Vogel is at the ranger station watching the woods through binoculars. He hears screeching in the distance and goes into the station to get his shotgun.

The group comes to dead men and women. Birch draws his pistol and says that it must be a rival cartel, and Addy wonders if there's anyone else who can help them. The hunter laughs and says that he doesn't know where Jacob is, and the photo he showed them was of his nephew, in his backyard. He bought the compass at a Salvation Army store, and he says that he needed their money, and made a deal with the cartel that he'd get $100 and they'd make the couple disappear and get their credit cards. Birch would go back and say that the couple got lost in the woods. The hunter says that he can't just let them walk out of the woods, and tells them to get down on their knees. The couple refuses, and Birch prepares to shoot them anyway. One of the ""corpses"" opens his eyes and rips Birch's throat out with his teeth, and Birch's gun goes off, taking Jay in the side The Gantzs pick up the gun and Addy helps Jacob away. Meanwhile, the feral feeds on Birch's body, and more ferals emerge from the woods and eat the still-living Birch.

That night, the couple get back to the station, and Vogel takes them inside. Addy tells the ranger that Birch is dead, and Vogel tends to Jay's wound. Vogel has Addy tell him what happened, and Vogel says that the ferals weren't afraid of the gun. He goes to the window and says that he's not allowed to tell them what the ferals are. Jay aims the gun at Vogel and demands answers, and has Addy get Vogel's shotgun.

Vogel takes a file folder out of a cabinet and says that the national park system was created to keep Americans from things that would kill and eat them. He explains that the ferals are a subpopulation of humans that live in the deep woods like animals, and were sometimes known as ""wild men"". Whenever they can, the ferals go cannibal. They've been inbreeding, and might be descended from mountain men or Confederate soldiers who never surrendered. There are pockets of ferals in every national park. The government needs its citizens to believe they're in control, and the parks generate billions in revenue that the government can't risk losing. Addy remembers being soldiers sent in the day Jacob went missing, and went into the woods and never came out. Vogel says that they were on their own mission, to kill as many ferals as possible for ""population control"". The ranger was sent in with them because he knew the area, and the ferals killed the soldiers.

The ranger asks for his gun back, and Jay gives it to him. He says that he'll call on the radio to get Jay to a hospital, and warns that the ferals are moving into areas they're not supposed to be. It's his duty to call in for another sweep, and says that if the Gantzs go public with what he's told them, he'll deny it.

Vogel warms up the radio and tries to call for help. Meanwhile, Jay tells Addy that she was right and he was wrong, and almost got them killed. Addy tells Jay that at least they know what happened, and Jay figures it would have been better not to know. He apologizes for everything, and says he wanted her to blame him so he could punish himself, so he destroyed the best thing he ever had: them. Vogel gets through to his people and says that they have a situation, and then a feral on the ceiling leaps down and attacks him. More ferals break in through the window and Jay shoots one with the gun. More come in and Jay discovers that he's out of bullets. The ferals tear Vogel apart and eat his intestines, and Jay and Addy climb out the window and Jay limps through the forest with Addy helping him.

The ferals chase the couple, and as they reach a clearing more ferals surround them and then stop. A teenage is in front of the couple, seated on a throne of bones. The real compass is hanging around his neck, and the Gantzs realize that it's Jacob. Addy calls to him, using his name, and he vaguely says ""Boo"" like he did when playing hide and seek with Jay ten years ago.

A tall feral approaches and asks who the couple is. Jacob says that they're dinner, and the ferals descend on the couple and eat them alive. Their blood lands on Jacob, who licks it."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14734742/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,A couple dares to spend a night in one of the most infamous haunted houses.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Liz Friedlander'],"['', '']",[],['title directed by female'],[],"A couple, Dylan and Connie, pull up to the Murder House and they tell the Uber driver that they're deliberately going in, even though they know it's the most haunted house in LA. The couple know all about haunted house in the US, and tell the driver that they're huge American Horror Story fans. They've rented the house for the night, and Dylan explains that the owners run a whole ""Escape from the Murder House"" experience, and he and Connie met at Comic-Con dressed as characters from the show.

The couple go inside and Connie takes in the energy of the house. She gasps, and then dismisses it as nothing. The couple explore the house, and find a card telling them to find the room where Tate first appeared to ""her"" and they consummated their love. They follow the black rose petal trail laid down by the owners they go to the bedroom and find dozens of candles lit, and Dylan reveals he's wearing a shirt like Tate's. The couple make out on the bed and afterward, Dylan smokes and they talk about why people like scary stories so much. They hear a child's voice saying they're going to die in the house, and figure the voice is coming from a hidden speaker.

A red ball rolls into the room and the couple go to investigate. Connie can't get up from the bed, and Dylan finally pulls her up after making an effort. They find the corpse of a nurse at the base of the stairs, and the nurse gets up and walks away. The couple follow her to the basement, and Dylan tells Connie that it's their last chance to back out. They both refuse and go into the basement, and go into a room and hear a child crying. They find three girls in a cell, who beg the couple for help. The couple have no idea who the girls are. The girls say that they came there ten years ago on Halloween, and Ben Harmon greets them at the door and told them to leave. The girls came in to give Ben a Rubber Man and Piggy Man stab them from behind.

One of the girls points out that if someone is killed in Murder House, they can never leave. Connie agrees, but Dylan figures that it's part of the experience. The Infantata dashes past, cutting Dylan as it passes. Connie yells that they want it to stop, and Rubber Man appears in the cell and kills the girls. Connie yells that she wants the owners to stop, and one of the girls calls through the bars, saying that it's real. The couple runs, and the Infantata pulls Connie down. Dylan kicks it off Connie and pulls her up the stairs, but Addie is waiting and shoots Dylan dead. She tells Connie that they've come for the couple's deaths, and Connie manages to shove past her. The other ghosts appear and one of them slashes Connie across the arm. She shoves him over the banister and runs up, but Twisty beats her to death with a juggling a club.

The game ends, declaring the Connie avatar dead. The teenage player, Rory, complains that the controls are glitched, and his mother Michelle asks that that's fixed but what does he think of the game in general. Rory tells his mother that characters from wrong seasons are in the House, and that people trapped in the house are trapped by their own personality flaws. Michelle says that she put everything they had financially into making the game, and she needs it to work out for their family. Rory tells her that she could have just watched the show with him, and Michelle doesn't get the vibe of the show. Michelle insists that she's trying, and Rory goes to stay at his father's., and might stay there for a couple of weeks because things have gotten weird there.

Michelle binges 'American Horror Story' on streaming and takes notes, Later, Michelle goes to the house and the real estate agent, Tim Williams, admits that the bodies of nine murder victims were found there. Michelle tells him that he knows, and gets it at for a much lower price because the bank can't sell it otherwise. Meanwhile, Michelle whispers to herself that she's going to make the House reveal all its secrets to her

On Halloween, Michelle goes to her ex-husband Steven's house and admires Rory's costume when he come to the door. She says that she brought him clothes because she's going away to a writers' convention for a week and find out more about American Horror Story. Steven comes to the door and he sarcastically says that when she goes broke, he has to pay for Rory. He tells Michelle that she's on one of her obsessions again, and she says that since they're not married she can do without his opinion. Steven continues anyway, telling Michelle that she's got a chip on her shoulder, and she's kill herself to prove that she's right. Michelle talks to Rory privately and says the trip will be the answer to all their worries. Rory tells her that she has nothing to prove to him, but Michelle kisses him and says that she's going.

Michelle drives to the House, and two red-headed boys run up to her and says that she's going to die in the house, and run off. The various ghosts walk out of the house and into the night, passing Michelle. As Maya walks by with her friends, she tells Michelle not go in because it's already crowded.

Ruby is at the door, and Michelle wonders if they're all superfans. Scarlett arrives, and Ruby asks her to come in for a bit. Michelle goes after them and they disappear, and Michelle calls out saying that she's the new owner. She walks through the house and upstairs, and says that she's making a game based on the House.

Scarlett is in the tub, and Ruby comes up from the water. Her lover asks Ruby do if she could escape the house and put her soul to rest for good, would she do it. Ruby says that she wouldn't now that she's met Scarlett, Scarlett doesn't care if the others are freed, including her dads, and the two women kiss. Scarlett says that her days are spent in working at a dead-end job and watching TV, waiting for Halloween so she be with Ruby on Halloween. Ruby says that they should go cause some trouble.

Michelle sits in the kitchen, and a red ball rolls across the floor to her feet. She follows it back to where it came from and finds Ben sitting in his office, crying. He apologizes for sobbing and recognizes Michelle. She says that she'll never close the deal, and just needed a way in. Michelle explains that she's trying to get inspiration for her video game. When Ben talks about counseling against violent video games, Michelle realizes who he is and he says that he's there paying for his sins like everyone else trapped there. Michelle figures that he's playing a joke on her, and Ben assures her that it's no joke. When he blames the women in his life for cheating, Michelle sits down across from him and he has to take personal responsibility for his own actions.

Ben explains that he thought he could have a family, and a life away from them. He ended up in the House with nothing. He figures Michelle is judging him because Steven cheated on her, and Michelle explains that Steven was faithful and she's judging Ben because she can. Michelle talks about the problems in her former marriage, and how she eventually gets bored and then hurtful. Ben understands, and Michelle asks him what the House is like. She asks what's the point of the House is, and Ben tells her that there is no point and it's dull. Michelle tells Ben that Rory thinks people are trapped there because they never resolved their issues when they were alive, and suggests that the point is that people have to learn and grow. Ben doesn't think much of her idea, and says he tried that with Tate after Ben got stuck there, and it didn't work.

Michelle asks to speak to somebody who isn't so lost and hopeless. Ben tells her that there's nobody like that in the House, walks out, and disappears. Ruby and Scarlett come up to Michelle, Scarlett in the rubber suit. Michelle says that she can't get a vibe for the house and will make a game about something else. Ruby tells her that most of the spirits have no interest in growth, and the only thing they like more than being stuck in their own misery is being stuck there with someone even more miserable. All they need is more souls to feed the suffering.

Rubber Man appears behind the women, while Ben comes up to Michelle and tells her to run. Rubber Man kills Ben as he takes Michelle to the door, and Scarlett kills Michelle.

One Year Later: Halloween

Michelle goes to Steven's house and greets Rory as he comes out. They hug and then Rory assumes she's an impostor. Michelle says that they have one night together, and apologizes for lying and saying she was going to a convention. Rory figures she didn't tell him because she didn't want him to stop her, and once they got calls about her failing to buy the House, he knew her obsession had killed her. His mother says that she just wanted to make Rory proud, and he tells her that she could have impressed him if she had gone to a psychiatrist and dealt with her issues. Michelle says that she's stuck and there's no escaping Murder House. Rory says that he thinks there is, and she needs to burn it to the ground. She says that if it works, she never sees him again. He tells her that she was gone from him a long time ago, and it's time for all of the misery of the House to end. Michelle says that there are good people in the house, and makes her son promise that he won't do anything to the House. Rory then tells her that he isn't dressed up because he doesn't like Halloween anymore, and rides off on his bicycle.

The ghosts return to the House, and Scarlett and Ruby say their goodbyes for another year. They kiss and then Ruby disappears into the House as the sun rises. She's in one of the windows, and waves goodbye to Scarlett and Scarlett waves back and then walks away. Rory walks up to the House with a wheelbarrow filled with gas cans.

Ruby is running water in the tub, and looks out the window to see Rory pouring gas onto the lawn. Michelle joins her and says that Rory is her son, and he's trying to burn down the House. She says that Rory believes burning down the House will free the spirits, and hopes it will. Ruby asks what happens to those of them that don't want to be free, and goes out to confront Rory. Dr. Grant comes up to Michelle and tells her that she and Rory should consider family therapy. Michelle pushes past Grant and goes out.

Ruby goes down the stairs and prepares to gut Rory, making sure he dies outside the property. Ben, Maya and the other girls grab Ruby and say that they want to be free, and they all stab Ruby. He then goes over to Ruby and cuts her throat, and he and the girls go to the window to watch Rory. The dying Ruby calls Scarlett for help, and Scarlett drives back to the House.

Michelle goes out and asks Rory if he's sure it's what he wants, and he says that he does. She says that the video game will be a seller, and Rory takes out matches and tells his mother goodbye. Ruby stabs Michelle repeatedly, and Michelle yells at Rory to light the House up. Ruby advances on Rory, who can't get the matches to light. Ben and the girls grab Ruby and drag her back, and Scarlett arrives and grabs Rory's wrist, and begs him to stop. Ben and Michelle yell at Rory to do it, and he lights a match and drops into the gasoline. It ignores and the flames consume the House, the blast knocking Rory and Scarlett back. Ruby calls to Scarlett to die with her, and Michelle waves goodbye to Rory. Scarlett mouths to Ruby that she can't, and Ruby goes into the House with the others.

Later, Rory and Steven watch the news about the House burning down. Rory smiles in satisfaction.

Three Years Later

Scarlett drives to a condo built where the House stood, and Tim shows her around. When he tries to put a good face on it, she asks if he tells people that the House once stood there. Tim says that he used to, but nobody in the first six months has been harmed or seen any spirits. He figures that the fire purified whatever occult forces were contained in the House, and the spirits are finally free. Scarlett confirms that it's the last unit and says that she'll take it and pay the $1 million in cash. Tim asks where she got the money, and Scarlett says that she became a hired assassin, and is now semiretired. The realtor takes the news in stride and says that he'll draw up the papers.

Later, Scarlett moves in. She lights candles in the bathroom and looks at herself in the mirror. Scarlett gets into the filled bathtub and calls to Ruby, saying that she's there and ready to be with her forever. She figures that she's too late and Ruby is gone forever. Scarlett then goes to bed, and Ruby appears besides her. They hug and Ruby says that the others chose to move on and are gone. Ruby was the only one who wanted to stay, for Scarlett, and she knew her lover would come back for her. Scarlett says that true love never dies and they kiss.

Rory is playing the 'Escape From Murder House' video game, and it ends with Scarlett and Ruby reunited. Michelle asks him if the game gets the vibe, and he tells his mother that it's so much better. Rory says that he likes it and it's super cool, and he's proud of his mother. Michelle thanks him and they go to get something to eat. As they go, Rory asks Michelle where he thinks all the trapped spirits went. She figures that the one who wanted to stay stayed, and the ones who wanted to move on moved on. Michelle hopes that none of them escaped into the world.

Once they leave, the red ball rolls across the floor."

Emily is at a polo match checking out Daniel who is playing in the match. Ashley comes over and talks her through the major players in the room, a list that includes Victoria and Conrad Grayson.

Cut to Declan Porter sitting at his father's bar texting with Charlotte Grayson, who is bored at the polo match. Declan's father Carl (Brian Goodman) gets a phone call that seems to be bad news. Declan asks if Charlie wants to go on a boat ride.

Charlotte is with Adam (Robbie Amell), who takes note of her activity.

Daniel is not playing well in the match, much to the disappointment of his parents. An associate of Conrad's named Bill Harmon (Matthew Glave) wants to bet against Daniel and makes a few cracks about him. Bill and Victoria exchange subtle barbs before Emily walks over. She tells them that she has a strong offer down on Lydia's home. Conrad ignores a call from Lydia and Victoria notices.

Jack calls Nolan Ross, who had previously made an offer on his boat, and says he'll sell. Nolan says he'll buy it.

Bill and Emily discuss money. He thinks she should get her money into the market and they make arrangements to meet. Emily flashes to the memory that Bill was one of her father's closest friends, and one the people to testify against him.

At the match's halftime, Daniel asks Emily out on a date. She agrees, provided his team (which she has bet on) wins.

Conrad's head of security Frank Stevens (Max Martini) gives Victoria his guesses about Emily. Upon direct questioning, he admits to being aware of Conrad's affair.

After making the purchase Nolan tells Jack he doesn't know how to sail. He says that what he actually wants is for Jack to be his hang-out friend all summer.

Charlotte brings a few of her rich pals to see Declan at the bar. With the place empty Adam grabs one of the liquor bottles. Declan, outnumbered and intimidated, gives them the thumbs up. They head to the dock and Declan sees the boat is gone. Charlotte and her friends leave.

While reading a letter from her father, Emily flashes back to hearing Bill tell her father he's in trouble. She watches a video of Bill testifying that David was guilty of what he had done, including connecting him to terrorist organizations. Victoria calls to invite Emily over for tea.

At his office, Bill pitches Emily about the virtues of investing with his company. He shows her evidence of the success he's had recently with his top-tier investors, even revealing a list of what seem to be prominent names. She appears to be taking careful mental notes.

In the city, Lydia (Amber Valletta) meets Conrad in his limo and tells him that photographic evidence of their affair has surfaced and cost her millions in the divorce settlement. She wants him to write her a check.

Emily gets a call that the beach house was sold to somebody else.

Jack tells Declan that their father is broke and he sold the boat to help save the business. Their father overhears and makes it clear that he doesn't like that his son is trying to bail him out. Jack assures his father that they'll get through this crisis.

Later Nolan gets into his car, only to find Emily in the backseat. Emily reminds Nolan that she warned him not to get in her way and demands to know why he bought her beach house out from under her. He tells Emily that Victoria attempted to out-bid her for the house, but he ended up out-bidding Victoria. He is grateful to her father for giving him his start and has already put the deed to the house in her name.

""Consider it a birthday gift for Amanda,"" Nolan says. ""Tomorrow is the big day, isn't it?""

Over tea, Victoria politely does some serious prying into Emily's background, which Emily gamely handles. Emily reveals that she's obsessed with history and is passionate about art conservation, which is why she joined New York's Landmark Preservation Society.

""My father always said that our past defines who we are"", Emily says.

Victoria explained her own belief: ""I would say it's our choices that define us"".

""Maybe for the lucky,"" Emily replies, ""but sometimes in life we're not given a choice.""

Daniel walks in during this conversation, sweaty from a workout. Emily politely excuses herself, saying that closing the deal on the beach house had gotten quite aggressive. Victoria faux-pleasantly offers a toney ""quel dommage"" and asks if she'll be renting a fall-back property, or heading back to the city.

When Emily replies that she just received a notification that she got the beach house on her phone, Victoria looks visibly upset.

Just before a meeting with Bill, Emily makes sure he sees her hugging Nolan.

During their meeting Bill congratulates Emily for investing with his ""family."" She tells him she want to get involved with a Chinese cell phone manufacturer, saying that ""a little bird"" may have given her inside information. She'll wire him money later that day.

Daniel calls Emily to say he's got a surprise for her that night. Ashley is in on it.

On TV we see an investment reporter report that the Chinese company Emily mentioned to Bill is about to partner with Nolan's company. Bill calls her to ask about the information she gave him, and she says she wants to double her investment. After hanging up Bill immediately tells an assistant they are going ""all-in"" on the cell phone company.

At this point Nolan is interviewed on TV, saying that rumors of the partnership were misguided and he is instead getting involved with the chief competitor of the company Emily directed Bill towards. Bill tells his team to say nothing to their investors about what just happened. Cut to Emily calling everybody on the list of Bill's largest investors to tell them what happened.

Frank brings Victoria evidence that appears to suggest Emily had an affair with Lydia's husband: Both are members of New York's Landmark Preservation Society, and both of their names disappeared from the meeting's list of attendees at the same time.

Bill's assistant tells him they are ""finished.""

Jack is ignoring Nolan. Nolan presents another offer: If they hang out all summer he'll give him back the boat at the end of the season.

With Charlotte in another room. Adam sees a text from Declan about hanging out that night at the bar. He responds for her with: ""UR on big guy . . . wear something sexy!""

Emily and Daniel take a stroll on the beach. She tells him that both of her parents died when she was a kid. He walks her to the front door of her new place. Their first kiss is interrupted by a late-arriving Nolan and Jack. All of her friends are inside, there to celebrate with her.

At the party Nolan asks Emily why she bet on the wrong company and she tells him about her plan to ruin Bill. He smiles.

Declan waits alone at the bar, expecting Charlotte. Instead Adam and his friends show up and savagely rough him up. Declan puts up a fight but is out-numbered.

Jack is happy Emily doesn't plan to change the home. He makes reference to the home's history.

Declan's father breaks up his son's beating and sends the rich kids running. Upset about his place in life Declan says to his father, ""I'm a loser, just like you.""

Frank finds that there is a gap in Emily's record from age 16 to 18. Victoria wants him look even closer.

Emily and Daniel have a long kiss on the porch before he says good night. Victoria seems to see this from her window next door.

In her voiceover narration, Emily observes that trust is a difficult thing.

As Emily writes a red X over Bill's face in the Grayson Corporation photo, we see a flashback of her breaking into Bill's office to pull the investor list from his computer.

As Emily stares at an old photo of her and Jack, we see Jack getting home to find his father lying on the floor and not breathing.

Her voiceover then observes that trusting your heart is the riskiest thing of all, as we see Conrad and Victoria getting in bed for the night, Victoria lying awake with a look of concern on her face.

We then flashback to young Emily seeing that her father was having an affair with Victoria. Her father tells Victoria that Bill Harmon knows and may be planning to tell Victoria's husband. ""I trusted the wrong person,"" Emily's father admits.

In the present, Emily lights a birthday candle on a small cupcake. ""In the end,"" her narration concludes, ""the only person we can truly trust is ourself.""

""Happy birthday, Amanda,"" Emily whispers forlornly, before blowing out the candle."

She hears a noise, awakens and gets out her gun. It's just a dog.

Victoria makes a call inquiring about Emily and a board she was on with Lydia's ex-husband. Conrad got Victoria a necklace.

Jack and Declan's father has passed away. Declan is still beating himself up for calling his dad a loser during their last conversation.

Jack tells Emily about his father passing away.

The Graysons are hosting a fundraiser to kick-off the re-election campaign of a Senator Tom Kingsly. Emily arrives late and Kingsly (Yancey Arias), to Victoria's surprise, is immediately glad to see her. The senator knows Emily from her volunteering on his first campaign. We see Emily flash back to the courtroom and Kingsly, then a Federal prosecutor, ruthlessly cross-examining her father.

Emily watches more old footage from when Kingsly was the prosecutor who put her father away. The case jump-started his career. She calls Nolan and asks for help with a Power Point presentation.

Victoria tells Conrad she doesn't like Kingsly and isn't happy he's in their house. She makes a reference to his infidelity.

Daniel picks up Emily for a date and, snooping a bit, finds her gun. He suggests they go shooting sometime.

Nolan drops by the wake for Jack's father. Nolan asks Declan about his bruises and mentions there are many ways to get even with people who wrong you.

During dinner Kingsly's wife Diane (Nicole Pulliam) compliments Victoria's necklace. Kingsly gets notice of a private E-mail and steps away from the table with an aide. The E-mail has an embedded video of Kingsly. He is upset and asks his aide to look into it.

During dinner Emily excuses herself. She asks a waiter to bring a steak knife to her table. When he brings it is clear the man, Patrick, has a history with Daniel. We see that Emily had her knife and set the whole thing up. Out in the parking lot Patrick begins smashing the windshield of Daniel's car with a golf club. He tells Daniel that if he was a man he would apologize to his sister.

Another video of Kingsly is sent. This one has him with a woman. Victoria walks in and they lie to her about what is being discussed. Victoria flashes back to visiting Kingsly during jury deliberation at David Clarke's trial to tell him Emily's father is innocent. Conrad walked in and told Kingsly that his wife had fallen in love with Clark.

Daniel tells Emily that he dated Patrick's sister Sarah. He left a party drunk and got in an accident. She is in rehab for a spinal cord injury and his parents paid off her and the judge. She thinks he should own up to his mistake.

Kingsly tells Conrad and Frank that his affair ended in amicably several months ago. He doesn't think the woman could be behind this. Kingsly said that he paid for her to terminate the pregnancy. Since he is a Conservative politician, his hypocrisy and resulting scandal would ruin both his marriage and his political career.

Declan drives a drunken Nolan home. He wants to know about how to get even with Adam. Nolan jumps on his computer and accesses Adam's private web cam.

Emily reads in her father's diary that Victoria told him before the deliberation that she'd help get him free. He didn't know why that never happened. Emily watches video of Kingsly with his mistress.

Daniel's Harvard room mate Tyler stops by. He seems smitten with Ashley.

Jack is going to scatter their father's ashes. Declan still doesn't want to participate and Jack can't change his mind.

Frank tells Victoria that Daniel went to see Sarah in rehab. Emily drove him. Victoria thinks Emily is the reason Lydia's husband left her, which she plans on proving that night at the fundraiser.

Nolan sends a secret file to Kingsly's tablet that should turn a Power Point presentation when he opens it to accompany his announcement speech.

Tyler is looking for an internship and needs to crash for a while. Victoria talks to Daniel about seeing Sarah. He went to apologize and she wasn't forgiving. She tells her son to take it slow with Emily ""until we know more about her.""

Ashley asks Emily about Tyler. She seems interested. Adam calls Charlotte and says he's not into politics. He tells her to call him when it's over. We see that he has another girl, in her underwear, in his room.

Declan sees on the laptop he got from Nolan that Adam is cheating on Charlotte.

When Emily says she didn't say anything about Sarah to his mother, Daniel guesses his mother is having him followed. He says no matter what happens he'll always be honest with her. She kisses him.

Lydia's ex-husband Michael arrives. Victoria seems anxious to show that Emily is there but is disappointed that not only is their meeting pleasant but Emily was the person who introduced Michael to his current date.

Conrad introduces ""my friend"" Senator Kingsly. When he begins his speech there is a note on his tablet telling him to look for the red dress. Kingsly spots his former lover Erin (Kim Swennen), who is clearly pregnant. Kingsly then awkwardly tell the crowd he is not seeking re-election and is retiring from public life. Emily looks very pleased.

In a back room we learn that the mistress has been communicating with someone she believed to be Kingsly for a month. This person sent her money, gave her the dress and invited her to the function.

Emily leaves Daniel to hang out with Tyler.

Emily says good night to Victoria, and asks her if she can start calling her Victoria instead of Mrs. Grayson. She says yes.

Emily finds Nolan waiting on her porch. She tells him she got the footage by buying the building the mistress lived in and installing cameras. She says that she's still going to release the footage to the press because she wanted to ruin his life as well as his career.

Charlotte sends Adam a text wondering where he is. She opens her laptop and finds an E-mail from Declan. It's video of him in front of a sunset saying he misses her.

Emily goes to see Jack on his boat. He has his father's ashes and is going to spread them by himself. Emily notices that the boat is named Amanda (her real name). Jack says the dog named the boat.

Frank tells Conrad that the IP address attached to the videos of Kingsly was his own computer. They assume Victoria is to blame.

We see Victoria flashing back to cuddling in bed with David. He gives her earrings and makes her promise to think of him when she wears them. Victoria has tears in her eyes."

Conrad accuses Victoria of being behind the takedown of Kingsly. She reminds him how many people dislike him and the fact he leaves his laptop lying around. He's packing for a trip. There is a mother-daughter tea coming up that Victoria wants Charlotte to attend. She's not excited.

After a tennis match Daniel and Emily say they can't join Tyler and Ashley for a night on the town because they have a date. Tyler seems disappointed that Daniel wants to spend so much time with his new girlfriend.

Jack brings back the contents of their father's safety deposit box. It has the first dollar he ever made and their mother's wedding ring. Jack is trying to decide whether to sell the bar or not.

Victoria is also one of Banks's patients. We see that Emily is able to access Banks's private session videos. She flashes back to childhood and Banks, in an institutional setting, is not letting the young Amanda see her father. Banks is clearly her next target.

Ashley is making a video to be shown at Victoria's tea. It is a charitable fundraiser and Banks will be speaking. Emily mentions to Victoria that she is one of Banks's patients.

Emily stops by Daniel's to ask him what kind of food he wants to have for dinner that night. Tyler tells her he's not around and the conversation seems a little awkward. When she leaves we see that Daniel was actually in the shower. Tyler lies to Daniel, telling him that Emily cancelled their date. He then hides Daniel's cell phone.

Jack and Nolan discuss his father's life insurance and the possible sale of the bar. Emily stops by and says hello. Jack is considering using money from the sale to leave the country permanently.

Declan stops by to see Charlotte as she waits to be fitted for a dress for the tea. He shows her his mother's wedding ring, saying he's going to get it appraised. Victoria doesn't seem thrilled that Charlotte is speaking to Declan.

Daniel doesn't show for their dinner and Emily is calling him trying to find out where he is. Jack drops by to thank her for bringing his dog back to him. Since she's been stood up, Emily invites him in to share a bottle of wine. Jack says he's not going to decide about the bar until the end of the season because he's looking for a reason to stick around. Daniel shows up at the front door and sees them together through the window, seemingly enjoying dinner and drinks together.

At the tea Ashley can't find the DVD she made. Emily stops by and quickly ""finds"" it. Nolan drops by and Emily warns him not to involve Jack. He references ""retribution"" being in the air.

When Daniel talks about Emily seeing another guy Tyler quickly moves in with the peer pressure. He pulls out a bottle of booze and convinces Daniel to start drinking now that he is newly single.

Conrad is visiting Lydia. They discuss Kingsly and Victoria inviting Lydia's ex to the dinner.

Banks's speech begins and the video starts. After a few seconds we begin to see some of the most private confessions of Banks's patients. Emily is included, as is Victoria talking about wondering sometimes if having a second child (Charlotte) was a mistake. Charlotte leaves and Victoria accuses Banks of being behind all of this, saying she will ruin her.

Victoria tells Frank that Banks knows ""too much."" He starts working on helping her. Victoria flashes back to Banks deciding whether or not to institutionalize Amanda. Victoria offered Banks her own private practice in return for Amanda never seeing her father again.

Jack tells Declan he's not selling the bar just yet. A very drunk Daniel shows up with Tyler at the bar.

Nolan is waiting for Emily at her place to congratulate her on the genius of the takedown of Banks. He's posted more of the video sessions online.

The police stop by Victoria's place and tell her that Banks is missing. Banks placed a call to 911 and then disappeared. Frank shows up and talks the detectives into leaving. After they leave Frank tells Victoria he dropped by Banks's office and that her computer is missing. He thinks they need to find Banks before the police do. Victoria tries to call Conrad, who is in bed with Lydia and doesn't answer.

A super-drunk Daniel is hitting on some girls. Tyler orders yet another round of shots.

Emily flashes back to a young Amanda telling Banks that her father is innocent. Banks isn't buying it and threatens her with institutionalization. Nolan sends Emily video of Daniel at the bar flirting with the girls.

Ashley admits to Victoria that the DVD was briefly missing. Daniel and Tyler show up. Victoria is shocked at how drunk her son is. We all see that for some reason Tyler is stone cold sober.

Nolan and Emily sit at Jack's bar and watch TV coverage of Banks's disappearance. Nolan gives Jack the online link to Emily's session with Banks.

We see that Banks is locked in a storage shed. Emily is behind it. Emily ends up calling in an anonymous tip that gets her released.

Frank finds out that Banks has no idea who her attacker was. The storage unit was owned by Victoria's family.

Charlotte confides in Declan about her mother. He tells her that their mother left when he and Jack were young. He never sold the ring because part of him hopes she'll still return. Charlotte tells him the ring isn't real. They hold hands.

Not only is Banks's practice over, but she'll be spending the rest of her life looking over her shoulder. Emily calls Daniel.

TWO DAYS EARLIER

Frank shows Victoria that Conrad transferred $10 million into Lydia's bank account.

Ashley tells Emily about Victoria and Frank looking into her possible involvement in the mother-daughter tea fiasco. She also mentions Daniel coming home drunk the night before. As a way to make it up to Victoria, Emily suggests Ashley find a way to get Victoria honored at the upcoming Open Arms charity event.

We see Emily look at an old newspaper headline of the airplane bombing. She recalls a letter from her father where he explains that Conrad and Victoria decided to make him the patsy for the crash to deflect attention from the fact Conrad had been laundering money for the terrorists.

Tyler's internship falls through and Conrad invites him to work at his company, along with Daniel. Conrad complains to Victoria about Daniel falling off the wagon.

Nolan drops by Emily's place and sneaks a knickknack onto her mantle. He tells her that Tyler was the problem with Daniel getting so drunk, all but force-feeding him drinks while remaining sober himself.

Conrad tells Victoria that he had to pay Lydia off since she has the power to ""expose us.""

Declan wants Jack to hire someone to help them run the bar.

Lydia drops by Emily's place and tells her that she's planning to contest the sale of the home. We see that the knickknack Nolan hid in the house contains a miniature video camera. Lydia sounds like she's going to come after Emily.

""We all have our South Fork Inn, Emily,"" Lydia coos, referring to the place where she got caught cheating with Conrad. ""I just made it my mission to find yours.""

Emily packs up some of Lydia's things to ship to her, including Nolan's hidden camera.

While getting ready for work Tyler mentions Conrad's affair with Lydia to Daniel, citing it as the main source of the tension in the Grayson household. Daniel did not know his father had cheated on his mother.

Victoria wants to spend more time with Charlotte to try and move past what happened at the tea. Charlotte still isn't ready to forgive her mother.

Charlotte signs for a present her father gave her mother. She steps out into the driveway to find a very expensive new car.

Daniel drops by the bar to get his credit card and apologize to Jack for the way he acted.

Emily makes an appearance at Victoria's weekly lunch. There, Ashley announces that this year's Open Arms events will honor the Victims United organization, a group started in honor of the plane crash victims that supports those impacted by terrorism around the world. It was originally endowed by Victoria and Conrad. Victoria is obviously uncomfortable by this, and Emily notices. Lydia stops by, uninvited, and bitterly congratulates Victoria. She adds that she wants to return to the ""fold"" and Victoria appears to accept her.

Conrad calls Victoria and asks how she likes the car. Cut to Charlotte at the bar showing Declan the $200,000 vehicle.

Lydia apologizes to Victoria and says she is her ""only true friend,"" then leaves. After she's gone, Emily mentions Lydia's threat to Victoria. Emily also mentions finding a signed book that Dr. Banks gave to Lydia and points out Lydia was one of the only people whose sessions weren't exposed in the video.

Emily drops by Daniel's place, and they clear up the misunderstanding with the botched date the other night. They sit together and he tells her about his father cheating on his mother.

Victoria gives Charlotte the car. It doesn't help.

Tyler tells Daniel he lied to him about Emily to keep him from making a mistake. Daniel doesn't buy it.

Nolan notices that his video camera is now at Lydia's place. He's able to watch Conrad stopping by and yelling at her about her going to his house to see Victoria. She tells Conrad to help her get back on Victoria's good side and threatens to expose their framing of David Clark if he doesn't. Conrad responds by smashing a photograph of Victoria and Lydia together at a party, and storming out in a huff. When Lydia picks up the photo she notices what appears to be Emily in a wig, dressed as one of the caterers in the background.

Victoria tells Conrad and Frank she suspects Lydia was behind the tape. Frank is going to investigate her.

Nolan stops by and tells Emily that Lydia may be onto her, as Lydia is looking into rosters of a catering company that worked a New Year's Eve party several years ago. Emily explains that when she was just out of juvie, she wanted to look at the Graysons herself, and got hired by the company catering one of their events. Nolan then confesses to bugging her house because her father told him to look after her. She tells him to hack into the catering company's database and delete her name from the record.

At the Open Arms event, Emily implies to Victoria that the reason Daniel is not there is because of the problems with their relationship. Victoria is placed at the Victims United table.

We flashback to Victoria watching video of a mother that lost two sons in the crash. She told Conrad and Frank that she wants to help the victims. They opine that they don't think it's wise to expose the company that way.

Lydia makes another threat about getting her out of the house, informing Emily that she has found ""her South Fork Inn."" Emily calls Nolan, who says the catering company is faxing a copy of the employees roster to Lydia's house. Nolan tells her he'll go there and intercept the fax.

Cut to Frank snooping around Lydia's place. He finds the tea video, along with a copy of a speech she is supposedly going to give during the Open Arms event that will expose the Graysons. Frank calls Victoria with the information and they plan to handle it.

Lydia takes to the podium and, following a long venomous stare, innocently introduces Victoria and Conrad.

Charlotte and Declan are pulled over by the cops in the new car because Charlotte is speeding.

Daniel tells Conrad he doesn't want to follow his path. Angered, Conrad tells Daniel he's cutting him off from his trust fund until he comes around.

Meanwhile, Victoria tells Lydia that she can consider herself to be ""back in the fold,"" but to make no mistake -- she despises Lydia. Victoria tells Lydia that every time she smiles at her, that she should consider that to be a sign of how much she despises her, and that every time they embrace, to think of the warmth she feels as Victoria's burning hatred for her former best friend. Victoria then hugs an uncomfortable-looking Lydia and says ""good-bye.""

Daniel tells Emily that his sister got arrested.

Frank is waiting for Lydia when she gets home. He accuses her of being behind ""everything"" and they begin to fight. The struggle spills over to the outside balcony, where she falls over the edge onto the roof of a car.

Nolan drops by and switches out the faxes. While he's there he grabs the photo. He hears sirens and looks down to see Lydia's body and a crowd gathering. He runs off.

At the police station Emily and Daniel appear to have made up. Jack shows up and isn't thrilled that Emily is there. The police thought Charlotte stole the car but everything has been worked out. Jack thanks Daniel for getting his brother off the hook and Daniel asks for a bartender job.

Back at Emily's place Daniel and Emily head to the bedroom.

Frank lets Victoria know that Lydia ""jumped off her balcony.""

Nolan goes to his computer and finds video of Frank fighting with Lydia. He leaves Emily a frantic message: ""I think Frank just killed Lydia."""

Nolan comes by to tell her about Frank nearly killing Lydia, who is in a coma after her fall from her apartment terrace.

Daniel again blows Tyler off because he has plans with Emily.

Nolan shows Emily the video of Frank and Lydia. Nolan is worried that if Lydia wakes up she could expose Emily. Emily thinks they can pin most of what's been happening on Frank, particularly because he told the Graysons that Lydia tried to commit suicide.

Ashley is helping organize the Graysons' annual 4th of July party. Tyler tricks Ashley into helping him make a double date with Emily and Daniel.

Nolan drops by the bar and talks to Jack about continuing to pursue Emily. Emily calls Nolan to check on a file he is encrypting.

We see Conrad opening an E-mail with footage of Frank with Lydia in her apartment.

Ashley brings up the double date idea to Emily. Emily doesn't like the idea at first but agrees because Ashley, who is clearly a twit with no judgement about males, likes Tyler.

Declan asks Charlotte out. She says yes and also invites him to her parents' party. He passes on that.

Conrad fires Frank, saying it is because he is showing Victoria more loyalty than him but without mentioning the footage of him with Lydia. He cuts Frank a check and tells him his jet is ready to take him someplace far away. Frank isn't happy, mentioning that if it wasn't for him Conrad would be in prison.

Jack drops by to fix Emily's porch swing. He references the little girl who used to live there and her desire to move the swing to face the sun. Daniel shows up and tells Jack he's still interested in bartending. Jack wants him to start on the 4th holiday and Daniel doesn't mind.

Conrad tells Victoria that Frank has been trying to drive a wedge between them and shows her the video. She is stunned. Conrad has a gun, just in case Frank comes looking for them.

During the double date, Ashley mentions Frank being fired. Emily offers to go the bar instead of Victoria's party, but Daniel thinks she should make an appearance.

Declan asks Jack for a few hundred bucks to take Charlotte to a fancy dinner. He says no.

While Tyler spins a yarn about his rich family Emily starts asking pointed questions. She doesn't think he is who he says he is and doesn't hide it. Tyler eventually leaves and Daniel goes after him. Ashley is mad at Emily for chasing him away.

We see Declan taking some lobsters from pots.

Frank drops by unexpectedly to see how Victoria is doing. She tells him about the video and he says, ""I did it for you."" He tries to kiss her just as Conrad asks what she's doing from upstairs. She leaves to join her husband.

Tyler mentions Daniel's new job to Victoria, making it sound like Emily's idea. Daniel comes down and argues with his mother about the job. He also says he's going to work instead of attending her party.

Daniel drops by Emily's house. She tells him she was going to apologize to Tyler and they start to fool around.

Frank pays the security guard in Lydia's building to get him access to footage from the cameras in the lobby.

Fooling around with Emily causes Daniel to be late for his first day. Jack isn't happy to see a hickey on Daniel's neck. Two lobster fishermen drop by to rough-up Declan, who has been selling their catch. Daniel ends up helping to get rid of the guys by paying them off at above market price.

Jack and Declan decide they are going to Victoria's party.

Frank spots Nolan on video breaking into Lydia's place.

At the party Ashley tells Emily that Victoria sent Tyler to the bar to try and bring Daniel back. Emily spots Jack.

Tyler talks Daniel into doing one shot with him. When Daniel's back is turned, he slips something into Daniel's glass.

At the party Declan tells Charlotte that he can't compete with the money of her other suitors. She says she doesn't care. Jack asks Emily if there is a place where they can talk privately.

Daniel begins spilling drinks. He tells Tyler that something is wrong and Tyler tells the other bartender that Daniel needs to lie down.

Jack confesses his feelings to Emily. She tells her that he's saying it to the wrong girl, since she's involved in a relationship. He says the only reason he's bringing it up is that what he feels only comes along once or twice in a lifetime. He says he'll leave her alone if he's the only one who feels that way. She says, ""I'm sorry, Jack."" He leaves.

Tyler sits Daniel down and starts to tell him how wrong Emily is for him. Daniel yells at Tyler to leave him alone. Tyler says fine, have it your way, walks downstairs and deliberately bangs himself into a post, creating a cut on his forehead.

Frank pulls a gun on Nolan and tells him they need to talk. Tyler shows up at the party and tells Victoria that the bloody cut on his forehead came from Daniel hitting him while he was drinking. Frank pulls Nolan into a side room and demands to know how much Conrad is paying him. Frank sneaks away when he hears people approaching. Tyler tells Emily that Daniel hit him.

Nolan takes Emily aside and tell her that Frank is better at the game they are playing than they are and he wants out.

Jack comes back to the bar and finds Daniel passed out upstairs. We see Declan and Charlotte making out. Emily comes home and finds Jack has moved the porch swing to the place she wanted it as a girl.

Frank calls Victoria and asks how Conrad had the surveillance equipment installed. He starts to tell her that he thinks they are being set up and Conrad grabs the phone and yells at him to stop calling his wife. Victoria asks Conrad who made the recording.

The episode ends with Frank at Emily's place, watching her on the porch."

Afterwards Conrad tells Victoria that pretending nothing has happened is in their best interest. Frank has cashed his severance check and a guard has been placed at Lydia's bedside.

Emily drops by to see a nervous Nolan, who has hired himself a bodyguard. Nolan wonders if perhaps she's falling for Daniel.

Charlotte does an interview with the reporter with Victoria. Daniel is late, but Tyler stops by and tells them he's been doing charity work. Victoria and Conrad are doing a smallish dinner for the anniversary. Tyler wants to bring Ashley, but Charlotte isn't allowed to bring a date.

Tyler lies to Daniel and tells him the cut on his head came from Daniel slamming his head into a wall. Emily drops by to see Daniel. Tyler leaves, but manages to electronically eavesdrop on Emily telling Daniel she'd rather he not mention her to the reporter.

Emily comes home to find Frank in her home. He has her gun. He tells her he no longer works for the Graysons. He's discovered that she spent time in juvie and threatens to find out the rest of her story.

When Frank leaves Emily grabs a phone from a secret compartment in the floor. She uses it call a Warden Sharon Stiles (CCH Pounder), as Amanda Clarke. She tells Stiles that she thinks she's going to need her help, ""Again.""

Daniel makes reference to the reporter that he has a girlfriend. He won't tell her any specifics but says ""hopefully"" it's something serious. The second Daniel leaves Tyler walks in and drops Emily's name.

Despite her mother's wishes, Charlotte invites Declan to the anniversary dinner.

Nolan tells Jack he still doesn't think Emily is serious about Daniel. Jack angrily tells him to stop hanging around the bar.

The reporter drops by Emily's place unannounced to ask about her relationship with Daniel. Once Emily realizes Tyler is involved she invites the reporter in.

Victoria stops by to see Lydia. The doctor says it's possible she could regain consciousness at any time. Frank walks into the room and tells her he's leaving town for a few days. He promises to redeem himself to her ""or die trying.""

Frank goes upstate to see Stiles. Stiles explains that what Emily did was in self-defense. She won't give him access to records without a court order.

Declan shows Jack the Times article on the Graysons. It mentions the bar, but has a huge picture of Daniel and Emily together.

We see Emily and Daniel frolicking on the beach together. When they come back Tyler brings them framed copies of the article. Tyler admits that he was the one who told the reporter. Daniel is furious.

Stiles calls Emily and says she thinks Frank seems determined.

Victoria has paid Lydia's hospital bills. She tells Conrad that she and Lydia aren't that much different. Victoria flashes back to a late night meeting with Frank just before the authorities grab Emily's father.

Emily asks Nolan to find something about Tyler she can use to discredit him with the Graysons.

Emily stops by the bar to see Jack. Business has been booming since the article came out. She gives him an old mariner's compass to thank him for fixing the swing.

Tyler and Ashley shop for clothes for the party. When she ducks into a store Nolan walks by and references knowing about a restraining order someone named Leslie Montgomery filed against Tyler. Nolan tells him he'll explain what he wants that night at his place. Tyler is reluctant, but Nolan is very forceful in his demand.

Frank breaks into Stiles' office. He finds the file for Emily Thorne and begins taking snapshots of the documents.

Victoria isn't thrilled to see Declan is there as Charlotte's date. Tyler is ""running a bit late"" but Daniel tells his mother they shouldn't wait.

Nolan tells Tyler he knows the Leslie person was a man and that he is some kind of hustler. Tyler says a few years ago his parents lost everything and he had to drop out of school. He's trying to nose his way into Conrad's company to turn his life around and knowledge of his background would ruin everything. Tyler says ""let's make a deal"" and, recognizing something in his antagonist, begins to kiss Nolan.

The article is discussed during the anniversary dinner. The mood is getting awkward.

Frank goes to a strip club and takes a special interest in one dancer who matches the mug shot of Emily Thorne.

After a few negative references to his bar, Declan mentions Emily giving his brother a gift. She tells Daniel ""it was nothing,"" but Declan says it meant a lot to Jack. He says that in their mind Jack will never be good enough and he now knows the feeling. He leaves in a huff, as does Daniel, and Emily. Charlotte leaves as well and the couple is all alone.

Frank gets a lap dance with the pole dancer (Margarita Levieva) he was staring at. He wants to talk about her name, Amanda Clarke. He says: ""Your name's not really Amanda Clarke, is it? It's Emily Thorne.""

Emily and Daniel fight over her seeing Jack. He's upset she didn't tell him about seeing him. She says she's scared because she's falling in love with him. He leaves to take a walk.

Victoria and Conrad yell at each other about the shame of their marriage. He points out that she never looked at him the way she looked at David Clarke.

Declan goes back to the bar and tells Jack about the dinner disaster. Jack thinks he should talk to Charlotte herself, just as she walks in.

Frank explains his theory that the dancer was paid to switch identities with the real Amanda Clarke. The money has run out. She's been trying to find Amanda for years. Frank tells her who Amanda is now and that he works for her boyfriend's father. Amanda offers to continue the conversation in the strip club's parking lot after her shift had ended, and Frank agrees to meet with her.

Daniel and Victoria talk on the balcony about things not going as planned. He says he can't stop thinking about Emily. She tells him she doesn't want him to get hurt. He says that you can't chose who you love.

Victoria flashes back to practicing her false testimony against David Clarke with Frank and Conrad. Conrad tells her that they will lose everything if she doesn't lie convincingly.

Later, in the strip club's dark parking lot, Frank calls Victoria. He says that ""Emily Thorne is not who she..."" but he is cut off mid-sentence when Amanda Clarke (the real Emily) hits him over the head with a tire iron. She takes his phone and hangs up. When Frank's leg twitches Amanda moves in and appears to finish him off.

Tyler finally shows up, well after the dinner is over. He's got a rose for Ashley but she's really pissed. She tells him she's trying to improve her stake in life and he admits to his family's financial issues. He tells her he stood her up to make copies of Conrad's confidential database and will eventually be indispensible. She thinks they are similar.

Charlotte tells Declan she really likes him. They kiss.

On the phone, Nolan tells Emily that Tyler is a bit of a con man but, he adds, he doesn't know that you can't con a con. On a computer screen, we see that Nolan apparently filmed himself having sex with Tyler ostensibly to use as leverage later. Emily tells Nolan that whatever he's doing, to keep it up. She hangs up just as Daniel comes to sit down beside her, on her porch swing.

Daniel tells Emily he's falling in love with her as well.

At the hospital, Conrad is sitting by Lydia when she wakes up.

Later, there is a knock on Emily's door. It's ""Amanda."" As they embrace, we flashback to them meeting in juvie detention when Amanda was Emily and vice versa. We see them get into a physical altercation where ""Emily"" gets the better of her adversary.

In the present day, ""Amanda"" tells Emily that somebody named Frank was snooping around, but ""I took care of him."" She gives her Frank's phone. As Emily is removing the SIM card, Victoria leaves another message with Frank, saying that she is now officially worried and wants him to elaborate on his previous message that Emily Thorne is not who she says she is.

But as she leaves the message, we see Frank's body lying motionless in the brush by the side of a busy road and next to a long chain link security fence."

Amada makes cocktails for the two of them. Jack loves them and tells her to stop by the bar. Emily drops by with clothes for Amanda and Jack leaves. Emily's clearly concerned about her being a wildcard.

Amanda tells Emily she likes using her name and doesn't like Emily's plan of shipping her off to France. Amanda says Emily's the closest thing she's had to a sister. We flashback to juvi when Stiles told her it would be in her best interest to make friends with this Emily Thorne person.

Emily brings over more of Lydia's things. After Emily leaves, Lydia tells Victoria she remembers Emily being in a New Year's Eve photo.

Ashley tells Tyler she's getting sick of Victoria. He concurs based on getting the boot when Daniel showed back up. He thinks Emily is the worst of them all and says they've been playing too nice.

Nolan's bodyguard shows him that Frank was killed.

The police think Frank was the victim of a robbery-carjacking. Victoria tells Conrad about Frank's final 'phone call telling her Emily was not who she says she is. Victoria calls the police.

Nolan asks Amanda about Frank and the blood stains, then shows her he found Frank's wallet in her possession. He wants to know ""Who the Hell are you?""

They tell Emily and Daniel about Victoria looking into Emily's past. She admits to being in juvi because she ""took care of"" an abusive stepfather. Plus Emily has an alibi for when Frank was killed.

Daniel is furious with Victoria for sending the police to Emily's house and looking into his girlfriend. He asks his mother why she feels so threatened all the time and warns her to stay away from Emily. He tells Victoria she's lost the last person in the family who defended her.

Nolan officially gives Jack back his boat and tells him he doesn't have to pretend to be his friend any more. Jack apologizes for being a jerk and pours him a drink. He asks about Amanda and Nolan tells him she's gone.

Daniel wants to stay with Emily for awhile. We can see that Amanda is watching them from the porch.

Victoria asks Conrad a bunch of questions about Frank's death, implying that he might have been involved. They both are accusing each other.

Victoria goes to Lydia's room. While Lydia sleeps Victoria takes the 'phone out of her room. Lydia was pretending to be asleep and notices what she did.

Emily flashes back once again to juvi. She showed up when Amanda was released and tells her that she's come into some money. She gives Amanda a check for $500,000 and says ""I have a favor to ask you."" In present day we see Emily burning a mug shot of the real Emily Thorne.

Victoria shreds the speech Lydia was going to give exposing Victoria. Tyler finds it and starts piecing it back together. Emily leaves in the middle of the night and plants a GPS.

Amanda, obviously not on an airplane to Europe and intending some sort of double-cross of Emily, walks into Jack's bar after last call and orders a drink. She tells him ""I might just stay awhile."""

Tyler is playing volleyball in a game with Daniel. Ashley asks Emily about shacking up with Daniel so quick. She tells Emily that Victoria has been grouchy since kicking Conrad out of the house. Nolan calls Emily and tells her about Amanda.

Victoria brings Lydia food. Lydia remembers the night of the benefit and recalls Victoria saying she would never accept her. Southampton PD shows up with a warrant to search the place in reference to Frank's killing. They're there because they've picked up Frank's cell signal. After a brief search, the lead detective tells Victoria that they have found his 'phone on the porch.

During a mild confrontation between to two girls who've switched identities, Amanda gives Emily a story about being stopped by security in the airport on her way out of the country. She tells Emily she doesn't want to go to Europe. She wants friends and a life. Emily tells her she can't stay and Amanda says she never asked for permission.

Conrad wants Tyler and Daniel to compete to be the first to land a big client at an upcoming investor party. Daniel is still giving his mother the cold shoulder. Victoria tells Conrad that the police are building a case against him. He swears he's innocent and if he's framed he'll bring her down with him.

Declan and Nolan ask Jack about Amanda (who he knows as Kara).

Faux Emily flashes back to telling real Emily about what will happen if they find out. She talks about her father being accused of killing all those people. She is tutoring faux Amanda in knowledge of her life.

In present day Nolan calls Emily to say Amanda is not leaving town. Emily says she can't force her to do anything. Nolan's worreed about Jack falling for Amanda. Nolan is called with word that one of his credit cards has been stolen. He knows it was Tyler.

Tyler gives Ashley an expensive dress to wear at the investor party. Nolan calls Tyler to complain about him using his credit card for a $5,000 on a dress. Nolan wants to meet.

Victoria drops by to see Emily and talks about her strained relationship with Daniel. Victoria doesn't trust her and reference things in past. This leads to Victoria flashing back to Emily's father not being able to find his computer. He wants them to tell Conrad about their illicit relationship and she says it will only be a secret for a little while longer.

Emily swears she has not interest in hurting Daniel and wants them to work out their differences.

Nolan tells Tyler he's not as stupid as the other people Tyler is coning. Tyler moves in on him sexually and is rebuffed. Tyler wants him to be an investor at Conrad's party and buy in for $20 million. Tyler tries to use sex to get what he wants but Nolan brushes him off again. When Nolan leaves to meet someone Tyler jumps on his computer.

Victoria and Charlotte argue over Declan.

Victoria asks Lydia if she needs anything. She gives Lydia a pill which she ultimately spits out after Victoria leaves.

Amanda is drinking at Jack's bar. Nolan wants her to stay away. Amanda says Emily told her about who he is. Amanda says she does things on her own terms, referencing the ""ripple effect"" if Emily was to blow their story.

Nolan has covertly filmed what Tyler did on his computer. He sees that he has pieced back together Lydia's shredded speech about the Graysons.

Emily helps Daniel prep for the investor meeting. Nolan calls to tell her about ""multiple code reds."" He mentions the Lydia speech and her attempt to bring down the Graysons and their conspiracy against her dad. He also knows Tyler Googled the name ""David Clarke."" She tells him he should pretend to invest with Tyler in order to keep him occupied for the evening. Emily hangs up with Nolan and calls a man with a deep voice. She says ""It's Emily Thorne. I need to see you.""

Declan doesn't tell Jack what Victoria wanted to do. Charlie calls Declan to ask about the visit. He just says they need to talk.

Conrad drops by to see Lydia, who complains about the ""witch"" giving her pills.

Amanda goes on out on the boat with Jack. They kiss.

Charlotte tells Victoria that Declan just broke up with her. Victoria tells her is it for the best and says she loves her. Charlotte gets her keys back.

Daniel is working on a Japanese CEO and getting help from Emily. She speaks Japanese and he wants to talk to her him the bar. Alone at the bar it's clear this is the man she spoke with earlier on the 'phone. He says: ""Inside the viper's nest, you must be a viper too.""

Tyler is striking out with investors. Nolan shows up and says he wants to talk in private. Victoria apologizes to Emily in front of Daniel. She thanks him and leaves the mother and son together. They start to make nice and Conrad calls Daniel away.

Nolan says the only way he's giving Tyler money is if he never lies to him again and adds that he wants then to spend more ""quality time together."" He says he'll have his guy wire the funds next week. They start to kiss just as a horrified Ashley walks in and rushes out.

Tyler runs after Ashley and grabs her before she can get away. He says he was doing it to get Nolan's money. He wants her to step her game up. Conrad shows up and takes him away.

Nolan finds a copy of Lydia's re-assembled speech in the trash.

Conrad says that the Japanese man isn't going to commit to Daniel, but Nolan is going to spend $20 million. Tyler will get his commission as soon as the funds come through.

On the boat Jack tells Amanda about how free he feels on the water. She begins to cry and talks about how hard things about have been for her.

Conrad tells Victoria that he's moved Lydia out of the house ""while you were busy stabbing people in the back.""

Charlotte stops by Declan's apartment. He was waiting for her. He tells his ""number"" was $100,000, and Victoria gave him $25,000, which he's going to use for a place by the water where they can have privacy. They start to get physically intimate.

He references her relationship with the son of her enemy and tells her if he she lets emotions guide her, she will fail. She talks about the two primary obstacles to her goal, Tyler and Amanda.

Conrad has filed for divorce. Ashley tells Victoria she'll be of service and Victoria wants her to help bring her son back to her.

Tyler assures Ashley that what she caught him doing with Nolan was done with their future in mind. He seems to talk her into sticking with him.

Amanda and Jack talk about his dog Sammy. She clearly doesn't know the whole story behind her namesake's history with him. She is going to be staying in The Hamptons and they seem to be hitting it off well.

Nolan tells Emily about Tyler searching his laptop for information on David Clarke. She asks him to pull back the money he wired to Tyler so that he will try to blackmail Conrad with the Lydia's speech. When he leaves the room she grabs his flash drive and sees the video of him hooking up with Tyler.

Daniel tells Emily about his parents' upcoming divorce. He clearly is jealous of how close Tyler has been getting with Conrad. She tells him exactly how Tyler was able to get Nolan's money.

Tyler tells Nolan he wants to celebrate with a trip out of town.

A lawyer named Ryan Huntley (James McCaffrey) tells Victoria that Conrad asked to retain him in the divorce. He declined and says he would prefer to represent her, although it is a clear violation of any BAR association's Code of Ethics. Daniel and Emily join Victoria for lunch. With Daniel out of the house she says she likes having Tyler staying in the guest house.

Emily drops by to see Jack. They talk about Sammy and the circumstances that surrounded her Emily giving him the dog when they were little. She flashes back to giving the puppy to Jack before being taken away by Child Welfare Protective Services. She gives him a note giving Amanda permission to come by the house whenever she wants to.

Tyler brags to Daniel about being poised to get the corner office in Conrad's company. Daniel wonders how he was able to land Nolan's money so quickly. After Daniel leaves we see that Tyler appears to be out of a prescription for a drug used to treat schizophrenia.

Amanda tells Emily that she doesn't quite know enough about her back-story to interact with Jack. Emily gives her a childhood journal, so she'll know ""absolutely everything."" Emily stresses that she doesn't want Jack to get hurt. Emily introduces Amanda to Daniel. When Amanda leaves Emily pretends not to know exactly who Amanda Clarke really is. He wants her to translate for him that night during a dinner with Takeda.

Nolan asks Amanda why she's still in town. She says that Jack wants her there and Emily is warming to her.

Declan tells Jack about getting a place with Charlie. He hates the idea, saying he's too young and Charlie deserves to be with somebody who has an education.

With Daniel sitting at the table, Takeda tells Emily in Japanese he's worried she's letting her heart cloud her mind's goal. She assures him that isn't happening. When he leaves she tells Daniel he's agreed to invest $50 million with Conrad's company. Of course, it's actually her money Takeda will be investing.

Nolan is pretty upset about Amanda being in the loop. She references him being ""out of control"" with Tyler, but says she has that situation under control.

Tyler learns about Daniel's big score with Takeda. Tyler points out that he won't be getting the commission like he did with Nolan. After Tyler leaves Daniel decides to tell his father exactly how Tyler got the investment with Nolan.

Amanda now tells Jack about them finding bottles in the sand when they were younger, clearly something she read in the diary.

Victoria agrees to retain Huntley. He tells her she must give him full access to all of her records and be willing to do anything it takes to win the case, even fight dirty.

Declan tells Charlie it doesn't make sense for them to move in together.

Conrad tries to fire Tyler for securing the contract with Nolan in a less-than-honorable manner. Tyler responds by saying that if he's fired he'll expose Conrad and Victoria's role in framing David Clarke for their role in the plane crash.

Daniel doesn't like finding Amanda digging around Emily's place. She walks over and tells him it's okay. Amanda leaves and he tells Emily to ""be careful with her.""

Charlie catches Victoria snooping through her computer. She says she isn't moving in with Declan, but all she really wants is to get away from her. She chooses her father.

Nolan tells Tyler he's pulling his investment. Tyler responds by referencing the video of their sexual encounter. Nolan is genuinely shocked that Tyler is aware of the video. Tyler demands to see it and when Nolan shows it to him he pockets the flash drive and throws Nolan's laptop in the pool.

Jack makes Amanda a romantic dinner. He tells her he saved a keepsake from when they were kids.

After Daniel leaves Emily's place Takeda shows up on her porch. He's convinced she is in love with Daniel and he can therefore do nothing more to help her. She begs him not to abandon her, but he says: ""You are on your own.""

Tyler looks through the flash drive and finds Lydia telling Conrad about being threatened by Frank.

When Victoria tells Daniel that Tyler is still staying there he calls his father. Conrad tells Daniel that he ""settled the matter"" with Tyler but did not fire him. Daniel is furious.

Charlie shows up at Conrad's door and says she wants to live with him.

Ashley joins Tyler for dinner.

A livid Daniel tells Victoria his plan is to remain with Conrad's company but do whatever he can to help his mother in the divorce.

Nolan is pissed at Emily for telling people about the video. She is upset he sabotaged their alliance. He points out that unlike her, when he had the opportunity to expose her he didn't do it. He's tired of playing her evil games and is glad her father isn't alive to see what she's become.

Daniel calls Emily from his mother's place. Victoria overhears the conversation and learns that Amanda Clarke is in town.

Emily looks through her records and finds a letter from Huntley to her father saying that he will not be moving forward with his appeal of the treason conviction. She then flashes back to paying Huntley a visit as Amanda Clarke and asking him why he dropped her father's appeal. In present day she looks at a newspaper clipping of Huntley being given an award for his low income legal work.

The unethical attorney will likely become her next target."

But two days earlier...

Daniel tells Emily he has a birthday coming up and he's worried Victoria will go overboard. Emily suggests a clambake on the beach. He loves the idea and says he'll tell his mother it was his idea.

Conrad drops by to talk to Daniel. He doesn't want to lose his kids and admits hiring Tyler was a mistake. Conrad says he'll fire Tyler and Daniel tells him he'll return to work. After Conrad leaves Daniel calls his mother to say he's in place to help her obtain information that will help her in her divorce action. He tells her wants a clambake and Victoria immediately knows it was Emily's idea.

Emily apologizes to Nolan. She says she's made sure Victoria knows Amanda is in town. Nolan is tracking the GPS on Tyler's cell phone.

Conrad and Victoria have their first divorce discussion with counsel. In return for surrendering claim to all their other properties, Victoria wants Grayson Manor. Conrad is seeking full custody of Charlie. Since the prenuptial agreement from 25 years earlier was signed while she was pregnant, Victoria's lawyer wants to throw it out on grounds of duress.

Tyler tells Conrad he no longer wants to work for him. Tyler says he has video of Frank tossing Lydia off the roof and a recording of him discussing framing David Clarke. He wants Conrad to make him an offer or he'll turn what he has over to prosecutors.

Huntley (James McCaffrey), her attorney, wants Victoria to expose Conrad's infidelity in open court. She's not sure, but tells him that she's lying about having been pregnant when she signed the prenup. She had already miscarried.

On Huntley's way out of the house Emily spots him. She flashes back to confronting him just after her father had been murdered in prison. She shows him evidence he didn't use for her father's appeal and says ""they got you, didn't they?""

Present day Emily asks Victoria for a picture of her and Daniel she wants for a scrapbook. Emily brings up Amanda and says she and Jack are working on the party. She asks if they can spend the night after the party.

Nolan directs Emily to the video camera Tyler had left in the guest house. She also spots his meds and calls the doctor on the bottle. The doctor is on leave ""after the attack"" and says detectives have been searching for him for weeks. Tyler returns and can't find the camera. Emily watches through a window as he destroys the room in a rage, focusing on a picture of Emily and Daniel.

Emily tells Nolan that the anti-psychotic Tyler was taking is a serious drug. Not taking it could cause violent episodes. She wants Nolan to call Tyler's brother. The brother Alexander, a doctor, agrees to come immediately. Nolan arranges for a private jet to fly him in from California.

Conrad tells Victoria about Tyler's blackmail attempts. He's figured out that Tyler is no longer in school and they wonder if he's been planning this for years.

Emily shows Daniel and Ashley the bottle of Tyler's meds she found.

Declan tells Amanda it's weird he's helping plan a party for Emily's boyfriend. Amanda asks Jack about Emily. She sounds a little jealous.

Jack drops by on Tyler. He says ""we're done"" and tells him to leave. Tyler threatens him with the information he has and Daniel starts to call the cops. Tyler leaves.

Before the party Emily asks Jack about Amanda. He says it's hard for her to be happy. Emily flashes back to the two of them as kids.

Jack tells Emily he's making sure the gun is somewhere handy. She gets a call from Nolan, who says Tyler's GPS is showing he's on a plane for San Francisco. She invites Nolan to the party.

Nolan hangs up and Tyler shows up from behind him with a knife in his hand. He wants back-ups for all the files and the video from the camera, and stabs Nolan in the shoulder with a knife to force him to comply. Tyler looks at the live video image of Emily and Jack talking about him. He says he shipped his phone to San Francisco ahead of him.

Emily and Daniel talk poetry.

Tyler has tied Nolan up on a chair inside his home. He struggles to get free.

At the party Emily makes a crack about Tyler and Ashley seems a bit defensive. Amanda is formally introduced to Daniel's parents. Victoria flashes back to a long-ago conversation with David who wants her to meet Amanda. Amanda says she's thinking of moving there permanently.

Alexander knocks on Nolan's door but the gagged Nolan can't get his attention.

Dinner is served at Daniel's party under a canopy on the beach.

Nolan finally gets Alexander's attention and directs him to a spare key.

Nolan calls Emily to warn her that Tyler is on his way. Tyler answers the phone.

Victoria gives Daniel a ""memory book"" for his present, something very similar to what Emily had told her she was making for him.

Emily goes inside to get the cake. Tyler surprised her from behind looking for the camera. She starts ripping at him and slips something into his pocket. He grabs the pistol and points it at her.

Emily comes outside with the cake. Tyler is following her with gun drawn. Victoria begs him not to hurt her children. Tyler wants to play ""truth or die."" If somebody doesn't answer a question truthfully he'll shoot somebody. He asks Conrad what really happened to David Clarke. When Conrad doesn't answer he points the gun at Emily. At this moment Alexander and Nolan arrive. Alexander says he wants to go talk about things ""just the two of us."" Daniel tackles Tyler and knocks the gun away.

The police leave and Conrad tells Victoria that Frank's wallet was found in Tyler's jacket. He's now the prime suspect in Frank' murder. This means Conrad is no longer being looked at and Victoria and her legal team can have the ""battle royale"" they want.

Nolan mentions to Emily that the police didn't find any cartridges in her gun. She was apparently prepared.

On their way home Amanda says something to Jack about maybe their being more to the David Clarke story than they've been told.

Huntley drops by Victoria's place late that night. He's found a doctor willing to falsify documents to say that she was still pregnant when she signed the prenup."

We see the image of her reading the same book as a child and crying. Daniel comes home and says he has decided to put business school on hold to stick with the family company. He tells her he's thinking about moving back home. He brings up them moving in together after the season, but Emily says she doesn't want to move in with anybody until she's married.

Victoria, Emily and Nolan attend a Treadwell (Roger Bart) reading where Emily introduces herself and has him sign a copy of his book. She introduces him to Nolan and he seems interested in writing the biography of the young billionaire. He'll be reading excerpts from his upcoming memoire at Victoria's. She wants them to have lunch.

Emily calls Jack at the bar and thanks him for his help with Tyler. As he hangs up, Amanda pushes for a trip to Atlantic City. Jack declines and it seems she doesn't think he's fun.

At lunch Victoria tells Treadwell she wants him to interview Amanda. He doesn't like the idea and she reminds him that she made his career. He reluctantly agrees.

Emily reads her father's journal. David thought Treadwell would be an impartial observer who could help him. She watches an old news clip where Treadwell practically says he thinks David is mentally ill. She draws an X through Treadwell's picture on the dust jacket.

Treadwell drops by the bar and introduces himself to Amanda, explaining their history. He wants them to get together.

Huntley tells Victoria that Conrad is trying to strong-arm her out of her shares of the company. He suggests that she combine her shares with Daniel's, which are part of a trust from his grandmother.

Declan takes Charlie to visit her potential boarding school. It seems like they aren't going to have much time together and it bothers him.

Daniel asks Conrad about releasing his trust, calling it a show of faith and saying he wants ""a seat at the table."" Conrad sounds supportive. Conrad's attorney Barbara Snow (Merrin Dungey) drops by and Conrad tells her to have release of the shares contingent upon Daniel marrying.

Emily and Nolan stop by Treadwell's cottage. He shows them the only working copy of his memoirs, as well as all the audio recordings of his interviews. He mentions the interview with Amanda.

That evening, Amanda is getting pretty crazy behind the bar and Jack asks her to tone it down. She doesn't and goes as far as to make out with a cute blond woman to create a reaction, and then announces dollar shots as she pours hard liquor into any paying customer's mouth. Emily stops and talks to the increasingly jealous Amanda. She asks about Treadwell and Amanda says ""so what?"" Emily tells her there is more to the story of her father, but needs Amanda's help.

Meanwhile, Jack tells Declan he's worried about being over his head with Amanda.

The next day, Emily, Daniel and Nolan spend time at the shooting range. Daniel mentions a meeting with a prospective investor and takes off. After he leaves Emily tells Nolan she wants them to control the story with Amanda's meeting with Treadwell. We get a flashback to Treadwell's interview with young Amanda, when he used a different first name. Back then Treadwell told her he didn't think David was guilty. Alone on the firing line, Emily coolly shoots the center out of the target.

Daniel meets with potential investor Sophie Arnault (Morgan Hewitt), the very young granddaughter of a billionaire. Instantly she seems interested in Daniel.

Amanda speaks with Treadwell wearing a hidden earpiece. Emily is feeding her answers from a remote location. Emily has Amanda ask about why he didn't follow-up on what she told him when she was a girl. He says he just printed what he thought was the ""most logical."" She charges him with being in Victoria's pocket and tells him an upcoming public reading at Victoria's is his last chance to come clean.

Daniel tells Victoria he thinks the meeting with Sophie was a ""date"" of some kind. He mentions the wedding provision and says he's thinking about marrying Emily. He loves her and thinks this could be a sign. She is opposed and wants them to discuss it later.

Before the reading Ashley (on Victoria's orders) tells Emily about the terms of the trust.

Treadwell arrives and tells Victoria about his meeting with Amanda. We flash back to an interview with the Graysons. When he begins to ask about Daniel, Conrad stops the interview. He tells them he's printing the story and has nothing to lose. Victoria stops him and says ""perhaps there is an arrangement to be made."" In present day Victoria threatens to expose him if he turns on her.

During the reading Treadwell mentions his interviews with young Amanda. Ultimately he confirms what was in his book, to the displeasure of Emily and Nolan.

Emily tells Nolan she never thought Treadwell would come clean. She says she needs him to take Treadwell to dinner and talk about him writing Nolan's biography.

After Nolan and Treadwell leave for dinner Emily shows up outside Treadwell's home in traditional ""breaking and entering"" garb.

Huntley thinks Victoria should give Daniel her blessing to marry Emily. He reminds her that rushing into a marriage may not be the best recipe for a successful one.

Jack apologizes to Amanda and says he should have followed her lead and tried to have more fun. He wants them to go to Atlantic City.

Emily breaks into Treadwells stash of interview tapes. She flashes back to weeping while reading his book when she was a girl. Young Amanda was so upset she set the picture of her father on fire. In present day Emily sets a lit cigarette on the lone copy of his memoires. She walks away as his cottage burns.

Nolan and Treadwell come home to find his home ablaze. He drops to his knees and weeps.

Emily drops by to see Daniel, wearing lingerie under a trench coat.

The next morning Emily goes through the tapes she stole from Treadwell. She plays one of her father telling Treadwell about being in love with Victoria. David tells Treadwell in the interview that Charlotte is his child."

Daniel gives Victoria and Huntley inside information about Conrad's business. She thinks that this means he doesn't ""have to"" marry Emily. Daniel is upset she doesn't respect his happiness.

Emily takes Amanda to breakfast after she returns from Atlantic City. She tells Amanda that she needs to lay low on the heels of Treadwell's house burning down. But Amanda has no interest in leaving town.

Conrad asks Declan if he'd like to join Charlie at her prep school. If he can get his grades up and pass the entrance examine Conrad will pay the tuition. Conrad gets an envelope with a note inside that says ""open in private.""

When Huntley begins to talk about Conrad's shady finances, Conrad shows video of David Clarke talking about Charlotte being the name of his favorite aunt. Conrad's attorney say they will be ordering a paternity test and if Charlie turns out not to be Conrad's daughter, the only way she will avoid public humiliation is to take whatever he gives her in settlement.

Huntley is upset that Victoria didn't tell him everything. She thinks the fire at Treadwell's must have been the work of Amanda.

Conrad takes one of Charlie's hairbrushes out of her room.

Emily goes looking for Amanda and Jack tells her about being summed to the Grayson's place. Emily is realizing how much Jack cares about her.

Victoria confronts Amanda about her recalling an affair with David Clarke. Amanda denies any knowledge of the tape that Conrad has and storms out. When she leaves Huntley appears and sticks a cup she was drinking out of into a plastic bag. Victoria doesn't think Amanda is really David Clarke's daughter and this is her way to prove it. Huntley tells Victoria that preliminary results indicate Conrad is not Charlie's father.

Daniel tells Ashley that he's going to propose to Emily. Ashley doesn't seem enthusiastic.

Conrad tells Huntley he's not to going to tamper with Charlie's trust fund and wants to go to trial. He asks for a private meeting with Victoria where he tells her the choices are to either accept his small divorce offer or have the world think her daughter is related one of the world's most hated men. Ashley has eavesdropped on the porch and overheard this.

Amanda tells Jack about the meeting with Victoria and tells him Emily warned her that it might happen. Nolan takes Amanda aside and tells her not to tell Jack too much.

Conrad tells Charlie he thinks ""it's best"" if she goes back to live with her mother. He blames his work. When she says she can't stand Victoria, he tells her to grow up.

Daniel proposes to Emily in the middle of a torrential downpour on a boat. She says yes.

Daniel and Emily run inside and tell Victoria the news. She grudgingly says ""congratulations.""

Ashley complains to Nolan about how rough her life has been, in the process telling both he and Jack that Emily and Daniel are engaged. A shady-looking guy hits on Amanda while she is tending bar.

Daniel tells Conrad about being engaged. Conrad thinks this is part of a scheme, but Daniel assures him that he is in love. Conrad warns him that falling in love doesn't prevent the woman you love from keeping massive secrets. Conrad wants Victoria to tell him what he's talking about.

Charlie comes to Emily's place and tells her that out of nowhere Conrad kicked her out of the house. She tells her Conrad looked at her the way he looks at Victoria. Charlie notices the ring and says she's always wanted a sister.

Huntley tells Victoria the DNA results showed Amanda is definitely the half-sister of Charlie. Victoria is shocked. She then fires him as her attorney.

Jack catches the guy from the bar going through Amanda's stuff in the apartment above the bar. Jack tries to stop him and takes a severe beating.

Nolan goes to see Emily. He tells her about Jack's beating and blames her for what happened.

We see Emily meet with Huntley. He says that Victoria ""called in her own guy"" and he couldn't control it. It was he that switched the DNA samples for her. He thinks her father is innocent but says he can't be part of this kind of violence.

Emily goes to see Jack. She apologizes to his unconscious body.

Emily meets with Amanda. She tells Amanda that the Graysons framed her father and that they were responsible for the plan going down. She says she's returned to avenge her father's death and take everything away from Victoria and Conrad. She says Victoria hired the guy who beat up Jack and that she needs to save herself. Emily gives her a new cell phone and new fake ID and passport again. She says she'll say good-bye to Jack for her.

Victoria tells Daniel that Conrad isn't Charlie's father. She tells him it is actually David Clarke and she was trying to protect Charlie from the truth. Daniel says ""What did he do to you mom?"" All she says is that she can't talk about it and begins to cry. Daniel comforts her.

Emily tells Nolan that she needs to ""minimize the fallout from what I'm doing."" She thinks she needs to regroup, wondering if there is a better way to bury Victoria besides marrying Daniel. She's thinking about giving back the ring.

Declan tells Jack that Amanda is gone. He gives him a note. We see that underneath the bed is an interview tape missed by the thug who had broken in.

Charlie returns to Victoria's house but doesn't want to talk to her mother. Victoria flashes back the night before they are to give their statements. She asks if he'll stay with her that night.

Daniel tells Emily that Charlie's father is the ""madman, terrorist"" David Clarke. He adds ""that bastard forced himself on her."" Daniel thinks that Victoria was raped and tells Emily that ""if that bastard wasn't rotting in hell I'd track him down and kill him myself."" Emily then suggests June for weather, saying she wants to marry into his crazy family ""more than ever."" She glares up at a watching Victoria on the balcony across the dunes as the episode ends."

Victoria is watching an old Daniel Clarke interview when Charlotte comes into the room. She says she's pleased to have her daughter back and expresses hope that the engagement won't result in a wedding.

Emily looks at more video of David Clarke talking about being Charlotte's father. Nolan calls and he thinks they should be holding back. She tells him that her plan is to go public with Charlotte's paternity, and wants to do it ""my way."" She places a DVD of the interview into a package addressed to Charlotte ""from Amanda Clarke."" Emily looks at Amanda's cell phone and sees seven missed calls from Jack.

Jack is still recovering from his beating. He asks Nolan if he knows where Amanda might have gone. He wants to get in touch with her and let her know the reason he was beaten up wasn't her fault. Under his bed he finds one of Mason Treadwell's interview tapes labeled ""Interview 14: Amanda Clarke.""

Conrad and Daniel have lunch. They start to talk about David Clarke and what Victoria has ""been through"" when Conrad's father, Grandpa Grayson (William Devane), arrives. Apparently Victoria called him to let him know about the divorce. Grandpa tells Conrad he's worried what a messy split could do their company.

Jack leaves Amanda yet another voicemail, this one letting her know about the tape. He said he wants answers and the only way she'll get the tape back is if she meets with him.

Nolan and Emily talk about how Jack could have gotten the tape. She's not sure what it may contain and how much damage it could do.

Prior to an engagement photo shoot Victoria asks Ashley about her relationship with her family. Ashley thinks growing up without great parents can help a kid be more resilient. Victoria says she wants to go to lunch with Charlotte and Declan. Daniel tells Victoria it's not fair to keep Charlotte in the dark about her father. Victoria says it needs to be handled delicately. While Emily and Daniel pose for their photo, Emily flashes back to the first time she, as a bookish-looking, dark-haired college student, first saw him. She overheard Daniel telling another girl about being ""weighed down"" by his family.

Conrad shows up and has a word with Victoria. He yells at her for calling Grandpa. She tells him that if he wants her to behave at dinner that night he has to promise to be nice to Charlotte and never reveal her true father.

Nolan tries to get the tape from Jack when he asks about how to play it. Jack hangs on to it, telling him to find a player.

Victoria invites Daniel and Emily to dinner with Grandpa. Emily gets a call from Nolan. He says he might be able to find a degaussing device that could ruin it. She thinks the tape is an interview she gave when she was ten.

Amanda calls Jack. She's short with him and tells him to come to a hotel room in the nearby town of Riverhead and bring the tape. Emily is with her. She tells Amanda that they can't let whatever's on that tape lead him to Victoria. Amanda wants to tell Jack everything, but Emily says that Jack won't forgive her if he realizes she's been pretending to be someone else.

Victoria has lunch at the bar with Charlotte and Declan. Charlotte asks if she can invite Declan to dinner that night, but Victoria doesn't think it's a good idea.

Conrad asks Ashley if she's trying to work some opportunist angle. He says she's with the wrong Grayson if that's her game. He tries to appeal to Ashley's unhappiness as Victoria's overqualified Errand Girl, but Ashley doesn't bite.

Jack shows up at Amanda's door furious, but she remains cold. He pushes his way in and demands answers. She vaguely tells him the truth is that she's pretended to be something that she's not and that the little girl he fell in love with is gone. She again demands the tape. He says no and leaves. Emily appears from another room and tells her to go after him. ""No!"" Amanda says defiantly. ""I don't care what's on that tape. I'm not doing that to him again!"" ""Amanda,"" Emily tries to convince her, but it's no use. ""Stop calling me that!"" she snaps, then walks away.

Later, Nolan shows Emily the degausser that will destroy all information on the tape. He continues to pester her about not telling Jack the truth. She says her plan is to use Victoria's lies against her with Grandpa.

Declan meets Grandpa, who tells him he succeeded without a flashy education. Emily is then introduced. She flashes back to more of her first meeting with Jack, when she advised him to be better than his parents in order to get beyond his last name. Conrad shows up and calls Charlotte into the study with him.

Grandpa asks Victoria to promise him the divorce won't get ugly.

Jack comes to Nolan, as his only real friend, to help him view the tape. Nolan is touched by this. He asks Jack why he wants to watch the tape at all. He says if he's going to let her go, ""I have to know."" Instead of degaussing it, Nolan puts the tape into a player, and we see an interview with a very young Emily, talking about her father kissing Victoria on the lips ""all the time."" A distraught-looking Jack walks away.

Conrad apologizes to Charlotte for how he's been acting towards her. She reminds him of a story when he made her laugh after she was dumped by a first love. She says ""as long as I have you, there's nothing I can't handle."" They hug and Emily witnesses the embrace. Emily goes to retrieve the package containing the DVD for Charlotte that she'd had delivered to the Grayson home. When she grabs it, Victoria startles her, causing her to drop it. When Victoria picks it up, Emily quickly takes it, claiming it was a DVD from another wedding planner. ""I wouldn't want Ashley to get the wrong idea,"" she says as she hastily shoves it into her purse.

Jack goes back to Amanda's Hotel and tries to get Amanda to come to the door. He says after seeing the tape he's not surprised she wanted to burn down the house. An emotional Amanda calls Emily and tells her about him seeing the tape. Amanda says she's going after Jack. Emily tries to reason with her, but she says she's done listening to her. We see her just miss him driving away.

At dinner Grandpa tells Emily she reminds him of Victoria. A distraught Jack bursts into the dinner and confronts Victoria about her relationship with David Clarke. He says that she did nothing to prevent Amanda's troubled life. He shows her the tape and says if she doesn't stop telling lies about Amanda he's going to start telling the truth about her. After Jack leaves Grandpa asks if what he said was true. This leads to Daniel talking about the ""rape,"" and Conrad revealing that David Clarke is Charlotte's biological father. She leaves the table in tears and Victoria tells Conrad she'll never forgive him. Conrad reveals to everyone that Victoria had an ""ongoing"" affair with David Clarke and Daniel learns his mother lied about being raped.

Grandpa and Conrad argue about what happened the last time David Clarke's name was linked to the company. Grandpa thinks that Conrad should step down as CEO and start grooming Daniel to take over.

Emily calls Jack to make sure he's okay. He hasn't spoken with Amanda yet. Daniel tells Emily he feels foolish for defending his mother.

Declan tries to comfort Charlotte. She goes for the booze and he tries to stop her. But she's convinced Conrad will stop being her father now.

Emily yells at Nolan about letting Jack see the tape. She walks in her front door and sees that someone has gotten into her private floor safe. Her secret box is gone! All that's left is an R.S.V.P. card for the ""Fire & Ice Ball"" with the name Emily Thorne on it and ""Will Attend"" double underlined."

But first...

24 Hours Earlier

Emily and Nolan discuss who could have broken into her under the floor hiding place and stolen her box. She places a call and reaches Tyler, who taunts her as he is sitting with the box. He says if she does anything rash like cancel the engagement party he'll kill Amanda. We see that he has her gagged and bound on a chair.

Jack and Declan argue over Charlie getting drunk at the bar and Jack's relationship with Amanda. Jack gets a message from someone in Port-au-Prince about doing some work down there.

Conrad tells Victoria about Grandpa wanting to oust him from the board. He mentions her safety net (Daniel) storming out and she promises he'll be back.

Daniel tells Emily he doesn't want to talk to his father. He wants to cancel the party but she talks him out of it. He makes her promise they'll have no secrets. He goes to bed and she gets her handgun from a safe and slips it into a thigh holster.

Amanda tells Tyler that Emily isn't a good person. He responds by telling her that Emily framed her for the fire. He shows her some of the information from Emily's box.

Declan tells Charlie he wants her to get some help. She finds Jack's prescription for Oxycodone. She agrees to see a therapist.

Emily mentions to Ashley about Daniel wanting to cancel the party. Victoria tells Emily that blood is thicker than water, meaning that regardless of whether they get married she'll always be his mother. She wants Emily to help her reconcile with her son.

Emily gets a call from Tyler. He says if she brings money to a certain parking lot he'll give back her ""box of secrets."" And after that transaction Amanda is ""all yours.""

Daniel tells Grandpa about Charlie's trouble. Grandpa wants Daniel to help convince Takeda to keep his money with the family business. Takeda is coming to the party and has requested a meeting with Daniel.

Jack tells Declan he feels his life is off track and needs to leave town to get things in order. He plans to be gone for a few months.

Grandpa tells Charlie he thinks therapy does more harm than good. He's particularly worried about news of Victoria's affair with David Clarke leaking. When Charlie sounds set on getting help anyway, he tells her that Declan flunked his admission exam and needs help getting into school.

Emily sneaks up behind Tyler with her gun drawn. She cuffs him and examines the contents of the box. He starts talking about telling Amanda everything Emily has done to her as Amanda sneaks up from behind with her handgun which she had placed down to handle the box. Amanda uncuffs Tyler and they leave together after Emily shows proof the money he had demanded had been wired to an off-shore account. Tyler further taunts Emily, saying he's heard there will be ""fireworks"" at the party.

Jack tells Emily about leaving. Jack wants her to watch his dog while he's gone. Nolan thinks Emily should follow him. She assures him she can't and makes him promise to make sure Jack gets on the boat.

Conrad gives Victoria the deed to Grayson manor but won't give over the shares. He promises to give her an equal cash value, but wants Daniel to take over.

Daniel calls Emily and tells her about the meeting with Takeda.

At the meeting, Daniel tells Takeda that he can't in good conscience advise him to keep his money with Grayson Global since he himself is leaving. Daniel says he plans to ask his fiancé to run away with him the following day. Takeda calls Emily afterwards.

Amanda asks Tyler why he's so obsessed with going after Emily. He tells her he thinks Emily killed Frank and plans to get even by killing Daniel and framing Emily for the murder.

Before the party Victoria tells Conrad ""it's time to end this"" and signs the agreement. Once he leaves she looks down at the business card of a SEC Field Director named John McGowen.

Emily tells Daniel about Victoria wanting her to get them back together.

Amanda sticks the electronic funds tranfer in her pocket and tries to leave. She tells Tyler she's not going to the party and he pulls out Emily's handgun. She manages to hit in him face and run out the door as he fires a shot in her direction.

Victoria tells Daniel she loved David Clarke. He says he's done with her and is moving to Paris with Emily. She realizes that he hasn't told Emily yet. Victoria thinks Emily won't want to give up the Grayson name and tells him to prepare for Emily not being interested in his plan.

We see Jack preparing to set sail. Nolan has planted a minature surveillance camera in the boat's rigging and is watching remotely from his laptop.

Takeda gives Emily a gift at the party. It is her box. He tells her to leave and bury her father's secrets. When she returns, he says, her questions will be answered.

Amanda catches Jack on the dock before he can leave. She wants him to take her, promising that if he does she'll tell him everything and never leave him again.

Daniel tells Emily about his plans to move to France. She's doesn't seem enthusiastic and he's convinced this means Victoria was right.

Amanda tells Jack before they leave she needs to give the waiting taxi driver money (uh oh). She tells him she loves him and they kiss. When she walks away he notices blood on his hand and yells for her, but she gets into the taxi and leaves.

Back in the party Emily tells Ashley she and Daniel are having a spat. Nolan assures her that Jack is gone.

Tyler approaches Daniel on the beach with his handgun drawn. Tyler tells Daniel that Emily has been playing him. He grabs Daniel's cell and tells them they should take a walk.

Back in the party Charlie blows off Victoria. Victoria says she wants to show Emily her gratitude for talking some sense into Daniel about the Paris idea. Emily gets a text from Daniel's cell phone saying he wants to talk to her down on the beach.

Jack goes after Amanda. He hears shots and runs down to the beach. He finds Tyler's body on the beach and Amanda standing over him. Jack tells her to leave and tries to drag Tyler's body into the dunes. Amanda tries to leave in Jack's car.

Victoria grabs the microphone and addresses the party. Emily calls Daniel's cell phone, which rings on Tyler's body. This alerts Charlie and Declan in their underwear playing in the surf that somebody is nearby and Jack has to run away. Victoria publically approves of Emily just as there are screams from the beach. Everyone rushes towards the beach as Amanda get picked up from Jack's car which she couldn't start, by Takeda. It is Tyler on the sand. Daniel walks towards the group, looking confused and with blood on his suit. Victoria rushes to embrace her son. She whispers tersely in his ear, ""don't say a word!"""

Daniel isn't being charged with anything yet and the family is allowed to take him home. Daniel is going to home with Emily but wants a word with Victoria alone before they leave.

Emily tells Nolan she's worried Tyler told Daniel everything. Daniel glares in her direction while she talks to Victoria.

On the way home Daniel said he just wanted to clear the air with Victoria. Emily asks him what happened on the beach. Daniel flashes to Tyler showing him Emily's revenge list but tells her ""I don't remember.""

Conrad and Victoria want Charlie to stay at the home, but she's headed back to Declan's place. Ashley is put to work helping the family handle the case.

Jack returns home to find Declan waiting in his room. Declan is very suspicious of where he's been. Declan tells him what happened with Tyler and seeing a suspicious hoodie-wearing person on the beach.

Emily returns home to find Daniel looking through her box. She denies any knowledge of it. He tells her Tyler said she'd been ""playing"" him and had secrets hidden under the floor. Emily tells Daniel that Tyler was crazy and reminds him the deceased had held them at gunpoint. He seems to settle down and she comforts him.

An attorney named Brooks (Courtney B. Vance) tells Victoria, Daniel and Emily that not much will happen until the Coroner's report comes back.

Victoria isn't pleased that Conrad skipped the meeting with Brooks. He flashes back to the moments after the plane crash. Conrad told Victoria that he was responsible for the crash, that he has been laundering money for the group that claimed responsible. He told her life as they know it over. In present day he tells her they're in another tough spot.

Jack stops by Emily's place to see how she's doing. They talk about Daniel and Declan and Jack asks about Amanda. He says her phone is disconnected.

Nolan opens up the video footage from his surveillance cam on Jack's boat to show Emily what happened. They see Amanda show up.

Declan spots a frantic Charlie taking a pill of some kind. He wants her to talk to a psychiatrist and wonders if she was high the other night. She leaves.

Daniel tells Emily he should have gone to Paris. The police knock on the door with a warrant to arrest Daniel for Tyler's murder. They take him into custody.

Brooks tells the family that there is damning physical evidence stacked up against Daniel. Conrad thinks it's time he tells them what happened. He says that Tyler charged him, he fired once and then blacked out. Brooks points out that Tyler was shot three times, one in the chest and twice in the back. Daniel can't say for certain what happened after he blacked out. But since Daniel has a wound on the back of his head, Brooks think they can use that to offer a defense that a third party hit him from behind. He asks who might want to hurt Daniel and Victoria mentions Amanda.

Jack finds a shirt and some paper in his car.

Victoria pays Emily a visit and says she'd understand if Emily was reconsidering the marriage. Emily says leaving Daniel never crossed her mind. Victoria asks why Emily came back to the house when they were all at the police station and Emily says it was to get a change of clothes for Daniel.

Jack shows Nolan a receipt for a $5 million bank deposit he found in Amanda's jacket in his car. Jack says he followed her to the beach but couldn't find her. Nolan calls Emily and leaves her a message that they need to talk.

Charlie doesn't like what she's reading about her brother online. She asks about David Clarke and wants to know what he was like. Victoria flashes back to being with David on the beach and talking about leaving Conrad. There just doesn't seem to be a way for them to be together. In present day Victoria asks for Charlie to try and remember details.

An alarned Nolan tells Emily about Jack finding the wire receipt. Brooks drops by Emily's place to talk about Daniel. He wants to make sure he's completely prepared for anything that could come up. She tells him she just met Amanda that Summer and doesn't know whether she's capable of framing Daniel. Brooks' investigators are tracking Amanda. Emily tells him there is something he should know about the Graysons.

Brooks asks Victoria and Conrad about paying off a judge to downgrade Daniel's DUI. Emily admits that she was the one who told Brooks and the lawyer thinks she's the only one who is putting Daniel's best interests first. Victoria promises to be more candid with Brooks in the future. Brooks tells them the security tapes from the party were tampered with, kept on a three-minute loop. This will be used against Daniel.

Emily confronts Nolan about working for Takeda. She thinks the security tape tampering reeked of Takeda. He admits Takeda wanted him to look out for her.

Ashley tells the press the Graysons are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the third party on the beach. After hearing this on TV Declan goes into one of Jack's drawer and pulls out a bloody sweatshirt.

Charlie pays Emily a visit. Emily asks her about the pills.

Declan shows Jack the sweatshirt he found. He says he's not sure who Jack is protecting, but as of that point Declan will no longer protect him.

The next day Brooks drops by Jack's bar and introduces himself. He asks about Amanda and where Jack was on Saturday night. Brooks leaves his card and tells him to call if he hears from Amanda. After Brooks leaves Jack tells Nolan he needs to find Amanda before the Graysons do.

Ashley tells Brooks she thinks Daniel shot Tyler and will probably get away with it. Brooks tells her if she continues to perform well in front of the camera she'll be able to parlay this case into a new career.

Victoria and Conrad share a drink and laugh at how far their life has fallen. She tells him she's worried about Daniel and says she doesn't think he'd do well in jail.

In court for his arraignment, the sitting judge (Veronica Cartwright) denies Daniel bail, remanding him to the maximum-security facility on Riker's Island.

Jack tells Nolan he's not going to skip town, which Nolan thinks is a mistake. Jack thinks Declan needs him. Nolan places a call and asks about some photos.

Nolan calls Ashley to the bar and tells her he's learned the photos of Daniel being leaked to the media came from her. He is the only one who knows, ""for now.""

Victoria is trying to get Charlie to tell a sketch artist what the hooded person on the beach looked like. Declan drops by for orientation and is grilled as well.

There are still no leads as to the location of ""Amanda Clarke."" Victoria is adamant they spare no expense tracking her down. Attorney Brooks tells Victoria and Conrad they need to find another viable suspect. Victoria hints at lying about what Charlie saw on the beach.

Nolan wants Jack to give up on ""Amanda."" He's not ready to do that, given the blood he found in her jacket.

Brooks tells everybody that Daniel won't be getting bail. Victoria shows them a sketch that looks quite a bit like Jack. She and Emily exchange steely glances.

Victoria, Conrad and Emily decide hiring a spin doctor would be a good idea. Emily says she'll look into Mason Treadwell.

Victoria calls Lee, the shady young man she'd previously used to break into Jack's to steal the Treadwell tapes. She ask about getting a ""message"" to someone inside Riker's.

Emily asks Nolan to find Treadwell. He tells her about Jack and she thinks he should send him out of town on an ""Amanda"" hunt.

Emily meets with Daniel in prison. He's having a rough go of it. She gives him some advice about how to handle being inside.

Nolan meets with Treadwell, who says he'll never write again. He blames ""Amanda"" for what happened to his home. Nolan tells him about Daniel's arrest and the potential connection to ""Amanda.""

Treadwell meets with Victoria, telling her that the sketch doesn't mean all that much. Victoria offers him exclusive access and wants him to begin blogging about the case online immediately. Ashley has already set him up with a domain name. [thetreadwellreport.com]

Daniel is jumped in the prison shower and severely beaten by several men.

On Riker's the following day Emily and Victioria are told that Daniel sustained a concussion and a number of broken bones. Victoria immediately reminds everyone that the judge had promising to revisit Daniel's incarceration if he was in danger. Brooks says the judge is looking at house arrest and Daniel could be home the next day.

Treadwell stops by Jack's bar and tells him about the eyewitnesses placing him on the beach. Treadwell wonders if ""Amanda"" put him up to it and Jack throws the smarmy weasel out. Declan follows Treadwell from of the bar and tells him Jack is being set-up, adding that Charlie was on painkillers the night of the murder and doesn't remember anything.

Emily follows Victoria as she meets and pays off Lee who had arranged for Daniel to be beaten, and takes a number of photos of the exchange with her cell' 'phone. Victoria then meets up with a man who knows her as ""Vicki Harper.""

Emily breaks into a safe.

Treadwell wants to talk to Charlie, using her prescription pills as leverage to get her to open up. He tells her ""you don't have to be like the rest of your family.""

Nolan tells Jack that ""Amanda"" hasn't withdrawn any of the money in the account. He tells him that perhaps ""Amanda"" is waiting for him in Montreal and he should go find her.

Victoria and the ""new"" man speak post-coital. He is your garden variety starving artist, complete with an accent, who seems to be an old love.

While working on his blog Treadwell gets an IM from somebody who says he knows who burned his house. They tell him to check the drawer, where he finds his tapes. He thinks he's chatting with ""Amanda."" The person tells him Victoria has the answers. Of course we see that it was the real Amanda, Emily.

Lying in bed Victoria and her artist catch up on old times. She checks in by 'phone with Conrad, who tells her that Daniel is being released on $10 million bail and is on his way home followed by the press.

Daniel is set up at home with his ankle monitor. He's told that if he violates his house arrest perimeter he'll go back to prison.

Charlie is furious with Declan for selling her out to Treadwell. His latest blog post reports that Declan says Charlie was under the influence of champagne and painkillers and invented the person she saw on the beach. He tells her that eventually she'll understand, but she doesn't care, saying ""it's time for your exit. She hangs up and takes another pill.

Victoria arrives home to find out about Declan talking to Treadwell. The story has gone viral and now the family is in doubt. Emily confirms having seen Charlie with pills and Brooks says Charlie is no longer a viable witness. Daniel's entire defense is now shot.

Charlie admits to Victoria that she's high. Victoria slaps her as Conrad comes to the door, saying she may have doomed her brother.

Jack tells Declan he's headed to Montreal. Nolan is helping run the bar in his absence. After Jack leaves Nolan says he knows what Declan is doing, and that Jack doesn't realize his brother is protecting him with his statement to Mason.

Treadwell tells Victoria he saw right through her plan and wasn't interested in helping her frame an innocent man. When she demands he run a retraction, he says he knows she burned down his home and has his tapes. She says it was ""Amanda"" and he threatens to ""burn you at the stake"" if she brings Amanda Clarke into the case.

Wearing a brown wig, Emily picks up Lee in the same bar she'd followed Victoria to the night she arranged for her son's beating. She surreptitiously records their conversation while going shot-for shot of booze with Lee.

Victoria tells Daniel ""all this will be over soon."" She brings up the idea that Emily was the one who finished the job, asking how he knows that Emily wasn't there. He says that if she tries to bring Emily into his defense as an alternative killer, he'll confess to everything.

Emily suggests she and the guy leave the bar together as Daniel is trying to reach her on the phone.

Online Victoria reads about her artist, Dominik Wright, whose career fell apart over drug and forgery charges. He calls her, asking if they'll ever see each other again. When Conrad enters the room she hangs up on him. Conrad tells her she needs to be discreet with any affairs. She accuses him of directing Treadwell to the tapes. He calls her delusional. Victoria returns to Dominik.

Emily surprises Lee in the parking lot with a rapid series of strikes and kicks. He is unable to effectively defend himself, and is beaten to the ground. Emily tells his barely conscious form: ""This is for Jack... and that was for Daniel.""

She obtains an impression of the helpless Lee's key before leaving."

Charlie is the defense's surprise witness.

Jack calls Nolan at the bar from outside of Boston, where he is searching for Amanda. Jack tells Nolan to keep Declan from talking to anybody until he returns.

Defense Attorney Brooks tells the family his strategy is to paint Daniel in a sympathetic light and wants to open by putting Emily on the stand. Victoria doesn't love the idea. Brooks says the DA's office feels so strongly about its case that it's no longer offering Daniel a deal.

Emily shows Nolan the bugs she has in the Grayson home as Victoria is speaking with Lee about tampering with a few jury members.

Jack returns home. Declan notices the blood-stained hoodie and says he wants to tell the police

Dominik tells Victoria he's getting sniffs from art dealers regarding his work.

Jack shows up at Emily's place. She tells him she hasn't heard from Amanda. He says he thinks Amanda is in trouble and Emily suggests he keep looking.

Daniel tells Victoria that based on his past he is expecting to be found guilty. When he leaves Victoria calls Brooks to tell him he should subpoena Jack as a hostile witness.

Charlie is still taking her pills. Victoria tells her to ""find a way"" to get Declan to corroborate her story.

Juror No. 3 is visited by Victoria's henchman Lee. He says if she doesn't hang the jury he'll kill her son, and shows her a photo as proof of his ability to get new to the young boy.

Emily tells Nolan his job is to make sure Declan sticks to his story.

Charlie goes to see Declan in a fancy dress. She tells him this is the chance for him to fix ""everything, including you and me."" All he has to do is tell the truth. Nolan interrupts and Declan tells him that he simply can't lose his brother.

In court the following day Declan is on the stand. He is asked about Charlie's statement, and says there was no one else on the beach. He says his testimony is more credible because Charlie was drunk and had been taking pills.

Victoria makes sure to prod Daniel about the fact Emily was sitting next to Jack in court. An angry Daniel calls Emily and tells her he's not sure she's in love with him.

Jack tells Nolan about the evidence in his possession. He wants to turn himself in and asks Nolan to help him. Nolan immediately calls Emily, who wants him to keep him there.

Charlie gets a delivery of Vicodin from Adam, who wants a sexual payment as well as money.

Conrad pays Dominik a visit, referencing both his affair with his wife and his shady past in making forgeries. Dominik says he's been told what Conrad did to David Clarke. Conrad responds by suggesting he clear out and the two exchange nasty words.

A drunken Daniel staggers into Emily's house and accuses her of sneaking around with Jack, eventually pushing her. The police burst into the room, as Daniel is violation of his house arrest.

Emily tells Victoria about Daniel's accusation and says she's been working with Jack to look into information about Amanda. Emily says she hasn't found anything.

Nolan and Jack return to his place to find it ransacked. Jack realized the hoodie is gone.

In the city Lee being pulled over with Jack's sweatshirt in his possession.

Nolan assures Jack and Declan the Graysons are capable of anything.

Lee calls Victoria from prison. He says that if he's going down he's taking her with him.

Victoria tells Conrad about what she had Lee do, but says she thinks Jack must have set him up. Emily is listening to this conversation. Conrad tells her that Dominik is long-gone by now.

Daniel writes a letter to Emily. He says he's going to everybody a favor ""and end this now.'

Brooks is in the Riker's Island facility to confer with Daniel in prison as Victoria goes to see Dominik.

It turns out that Lee has hung himself and confessed to killing Tyler. Daniel's charges could soon by dropped. Dominik seems to have cleared out.

Emily plays Nolan audio of Conrad speaking to somebody in order to set up the Lee murder. In it he references another ""David Clarke situation."" Emily realizes that the Graysons killed her father."

We then see some news reports about Daniel's trial, which is being called a ""Trial of the Decade"" candidate. A crowd of protesters accusing Daniel of being part of the 1 percent voice their disbelief about the 11th hour confession and suicide that could exonerate the Graysons' heir.

Jack warns Declan about the Graysons knowing he lied on the stand.

Conrad and Victoria bicker about Dominick.

Emily goes to check on Charlie in her room. Charlie has been doing research about her father, David Clarke, and has a number of articles and photos spread out on her bed. She's found a picture of David in the prison yard, taken on the day he died. Emily and Charlie both think he looks scared, and we can see he's writing something in a journal that does not look like the anything inside the ""infinity"" box, a.k.a the Revenge Chest.

Emily calls Nolan with news that there must be a missing journal. She catches him pulling it out of a safe. He says he was honoring David's wishes by not giving it to her.

Emily reads the journal. He's talking about people plotting his execution as he gets closer to the truth. He writes something about a ""CM"" who is bringing him information he needs moments before being stabbed by a guard. Emily looks up CM in the Grayson company database and finds an employee named Carole Lynn Miller who died ten years earlier.

Noland assures Jack that Declan should be fine.

Charlie is still getting prescription drugs from Adam. Declan stops by wanting to talk to her but she blows him off.

Emily is looking into Miller's death when Jack drops by. He asks her about the Graysons and whether it's smart to marry into the family. Daniel calls with news: the charges have been dropped.

Victoria meets with an SEC agent and asks for full immunity in exchange for information about a domestic terrorist. He's going to check on what he can offer.

Emily meets Daniel and they leave prison together. Back at home he's greeted by his parents. Daniel is still getting killed in the press, which shows that public opinion very much against him. The plan is to make a huge PR push. Ashley tells Victoria she's been offered a position by Brooks, but Victoria asks her to hang around to serve as media liaison until Daniel's interviews are figured out. As Ashley walks away Victoria wears her telltale menacing smile.

Emily breaks into the hospital and looks at Miller's records. She calls the doctor of record, who says he had a Carole Thomas with a similar background, but says she is very much alive.

Emily goes to see Miller, flashing a Homeland Security badge. Miller was a secretary with Conrad's company. She pulls a shotgun on Emily and we find out this is Nolan's aunt. He tells Miller who Emily really is.

Miller investigated the Grayson's company, ultimately finding out David Clark was innocent. An investigator saved her life by helping fake her death. She recalls a white-haired man whose name she doesn't know, who met with Conrad a number times near the plane crash. Emily doesn't seems upset with Nolan for concealing his family, saying she would have done the same.

Jack confronts Daniel along, and reveals he was the one who dragged Tyler's body up the beach and tells him about the hoodie. He thinks Daniel owes it to Emily to ignore what his parents may be up to.

Declan tells the school about Charlie's drugs, which they find in her locker. She threatens to have her father pull his tuition.

Brooks tells Ashley that her job offer has been pulled. Based on Victoria's suggestion he looked into her background and found out she leaked the picture of Daniel. Brooks explains that he already has problems trusting his clients, and he can't surround himself with employees he can't trust.

Conrad gets word that the SEC has raided his company.

Emily wonders if this interview is an opportunity for Daniel to come clean and separate himself from his family.

Conrad tells Daniel what is happening with their family and Grayson Global while, thanks to a bug in his office, Emily listens in from a remote location. Conrad tells him about Victoria paying somebody to beat him up in prison. He then asks if he's ready to take on his role as the family heir. When Daniel agrees, he tells his son to shut his office doors. Conrad then opens up about everything, starting with David Clarke.

Victoria's found out about Charlie's suspension and the drugs. She wants to help her daughter. Victoria sees the picture of David Clarke that Charlie stole from her.

Before the interview Emily again advises Daniel to come clean. Victoria drops by and takes a couple of shots at Emily. Daniel asks Victoria about the circumstances that led to him being released from prison and placed under house arrest. Before she can answer his interview begins.

Daniel tells the interviewer he understands why people were so upset with him. She brings up the SEC investigation of the Grayson company. As Emily looks on from off camera, Daniel says that his father is the victim of a witch hunt, and he stands by him as a father and business partner.

After the interview Conrad offers Ashley a job at Grayson Global, sealing the deal with the gift of a luxury car.

Declan's tuition has been pulled. Nolan steps in to pay his tuition instead.

Victoria takes Charlie to David Clarke's resting place. Victoria tells her daughter that David Clarke was a good man, and because of him she loves Charlie even more. Then they spot the still relatively fresh rose on David Clarke's grave, indicating somebody has been there recently.

Emily tells Nolan about Conrad confessing everything to Daniel before the interview. She says she's still going to marry him, then she's going to track the people who killed her father and kill them.

In one of the Treadwell videos Emily spots the white-haired man. She recognizes him as the man who killed her father."

Conrad meets with Frank and Victoria. They have received a letter that says ""Shame -- David Clarke."" Since Clarke's been dead for months, they are treating this like a threat and are inviting anybody who might know what happened to Clarke to a party in an attempt to flush out who is responsible.

Amanda goes to Jack's bar, sees him for the first time and seems to be interested. His girlfriend at the time is one of the bartenders.

Amanda breaks into her old house and has flashbacks to childhood. Her dad is leaving for Conrad's Christmas part with his brother Bill, who gives her a present before the two men leave. Back in present day '02 Amanda finally takes the time to read her father's journals and learns all about what happened to him.

The Davis' arrive to stay with the Graysons. We learn that a dummy corporation owns David Clarke's old house and isn't interested in selling.

Jack and his girlfriend are arguing over money. She wants to make more money and eventually go to Europe, but he's concerned about his father's business. Amanda asks the girlfriend if she can work for her on New Year's Eve.

Conrad find her over there and we learn that the Grayson's own the place and Conrad wants to sell it because he thinks she still loves David. Emily hears all of this.

Emily works the New Year's party. She runs into Treadwell and recognizes him from her childhood. Treadwell tells Victoria he's working on the book about David and gives her the picture of David from the day he was killed. A man named Roger tells Emily he'd like to be seated as far away from the Conrads as possible. She recognizes his name from her father's journal as being ""a true friend.""

Nolan drops by Jack's bar and the two meet officially.

Amanda finds Roger a bottle of whiskey from Conrad's private stash. She asks him about her father. He wants her to drop it, but she says she isn't afraid of the Conrads.

Flashback to David leaving the Christmas party and says good-bye to Victoria. They talk about their children and appear to be developing a connection.

Conrad and Frank talk about Roger. Conrad talks to Lydia about buying David's home. He mentions that he owns the property and this leads to them fooling around.

A drunken Roger starts speaking a little too freely. He falls into Emily before Frank leads him away.

Nolan talks to Jack's father about his financial issues and the boys' mother not being involved in their lives.

Frank and Roger begin to have strong words about David. Amanda arrives with some aspirin.

Conrad addresses the party and announces that the Davis' will be moving in next door. Victoria looks shocked.

At midnight Jack's girlfriend grabs Nolan and kisses him. Jack punches Nolan.

Lydia and Victoria talk about the home. She tells Lydia that she lied about the home and apologizes. Victoria gives Lydia her blessing.

We see that Roger gave Amanda a piece of paper when he bumped into her. She reads it while watching Roger and Frank through the window. Amanda goes to his rooms and finds him in a bathtub full of blood.

Later in the night we see that Roger is dead and Victoria seems well-aware Frank may have had something to do with the ""suicide."" Victoria finds out that Treadwell was the one who wrote the note. He did it on purpose to stir the pot.

A sobbing Amanda calls Nolan and tells him about Roger. He warns her she'll never be able to bring the Graysons down. She yells ""the hell I won't!""

We hear Roger's note. He said he'd help her, but warned her to stay away from the Graysons.

A concerned Nolan calls Emily, as both of them have been watching through a hidden camera. The white-haired man comes in to see Conrad and tells him he's becoming a problem to the ""initiative."" Emily tells Nolan she's going to create a reason for the two to meet, then track the white-haired man and when Nolan asks ""What then?"" she replies ""You already know the answer to that.""

Daniel tells Emily he feels like it's his responsibility to help the company by using their wedding. He gets her to agree to sit down with Ashley and talk it over. Emily changes the memory card in a camera hidden in a book.

Victoria tells Charlie she'll be back at school starting in a few weeks. She wants her mother to go to family counseling. Victoria is not all that interested.

Victoria complains to agent McGowan about her husband still not being in prison. He says there isn't enough evidence of a conspiracy. She says she can't handle it on her own.

Daniel gives Jack some money to help with Declan and the bar.

Conrad tells Victoria he knows she was the one who put the SEC on him. She tells him about Charlie's addiction counselor wanting to meet with the entire family. Lydia is now hanging out with Conrad in nighttime lingerie.

Declan studies with a young gal named Jamie from his school. He defends Charlie.

Emily wants Nolan to encrypt a video of her and Daniel sleeping and E-mail it to Conrad. She thinks he'll think the white-haired man is threatening them. Nolan is concerned about how dangerous Conrad is.

Conrad and Lydia playfully hint at a wedding over the phone. Conrad gets the E-mail and immediately calls the white-haired man to set-up a meeting. Emily starts to head out the door, but is trapped when Daniel and Ashley come over for the wedding planning session.

Jack tells Nolan about getting the million bucks from Daniel. He wants to start a charity. Emily calls Nolan and asks him to help her trail the white-haired man and find out where he lives.

Victoria pays Lydia a visit. She tells her about the government's building of a case against Conrad and warns her that that she could be in trouble for perjuring herself all those years ago. Victoria tells Lydia about the fact Conrad is holding on the forgeries from Dominik Wright. She takes a letter opener and slashes one of them.

Emily tells she wants a private wedding. Daniel is irritated that Emily is paying more attention to her cell' 'phone (updates from Nolan) than Ashley's wedding plans for them.

At the meeting Conrad tells the white-haired man that he has evidence that will burn him if he ever threatens to harm his son again. The white-haired man stands up and walks out.

Daniel is furious that Emily keeps checking her 'phone. This leads to an argument about the Graysons. Even Ashley is pissed at Emily.

Declan and Jamie help Jack look for his dog Sammy, who is missing.

Nolan texts Emily the address where the white-haired man is located.

The white-haired man calls someone and tells them ""someone's on to us."" The doorbell rings and we see that it is Nolan in a fake mustache pretending to be the cable guy. He's given Emily the wrong address.

Emily and Nolan's mother argue over what she's planning and whether David would have approved.

Nolan works on the cable as the white-haired man watches him carefully. The white-haired man asks for a card. He quizzes Nolan before letting him leave.

Conrad returns home to a concerned Lydia. She tells him about the painting and the evidence. There is a letter waiting for Conrad.

Nolan tells Emily that he ""gave her options."" Emily comes home to find a very sick-looking Sammy on her porch. She calls Jack to let him know.

During the counseling session Conrad says a number of negative things about the entire family. Victoria tells him that Lydia has betrayed him. Charlie is frustrated and walks away.

Jack lays Sammy in front of the fire. Jack is emotional, saying he doesn't think he can say good-bye. Eventually he does and both he and Emily weep. She flashes back to her childhood.

Declan and Jamie return to his place, planning to make some ""Lost Dog"" signs for Sammy. When Jamie goes to the bathroom a weepy Charlie walks in complaining about her family. She says nice things about him and asks if she can stay the night. Jamie walks out of the bathroom and Charlie jumps to conclusions. The two women bicker and Charlie makes a crack about Declan having skeletons in his closet.

Daniel tells Victoria that if she destroys Conrad ""you're dead to me.""

Emily and Jack kiss passionately after Sammy dies. Ashley witnesses this through the door.

Jack and Emily have dug a grave for Sammy. Before he goes to get the body he tells her how nice it was to have somebody with him. Jack talks about Sammy leading him to her all those years ago. They don't know what they're going to do. Emily continues to dig, which appears to be what we saw in the opening.

Charlie scores more drugs from her dealer.

With Emily watching via hidden camera, Victoria tells Daniel she agrees to his ultimatum. She gives him the evidence she'd been planning to turn over and tells him ""what you chose to do with it is entirely up to you."" After his mother leaves Daniel calls Conrad and says ""Mom bought it."" He'll bring the information to his father in the morning. Victoria hears this call from the hallway.

Jack tells Declan that Sammy is dead.

Nolan calls Emily. She thanks him and says she's ""starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel."" He shows her that he has video surveillance inside the white-haired man's home.

Daniel returns home and embraces Emily. She apologizes and goes to bed without any word of the suitcase he had in his hands.

Nolan notices that something is wrong with the video feed because the clock in the white-haired man's living room is displaying the wrong time. Just as he starts to figure out that he's watching a video loop instead of a live feed, the white-haired man sneaks up from behind him and chokes him unconscious."

Emily can't reach Nolan on his phone.

Jack looks at the check from Daniel and gives Emily a call. She doesn't answer.

Emily finds the back door open at Nolan's place. On a table is Nolan's laptop, open with a picture of sign on the screen. It says ""CALL MY CELL OR I DIE."" She calls and can see the white haired man answer on the screen. He's in a holding cell of some kind with Nolan. She tells him Nolan's not the one he wants. She tells him her real name and that she knows he killed her father. He agrees they have unfinished business and asks how they should handle it. ""Face to face,"" she says.

Victoria doesn't want to let Conrad search the home. Three microphones are quickly found in his study. Conrad thinks her talks with the SEC are to blame.

Daniel finds a camera in a book in his room.

Emily meets with the white haired man, who immediately pulls a gun on and finds out she's not armed or wired. She tells him about the evidence in her possession about the Initiative's role in carrying out a terrorist plot on U.S. soil. She wants to be taken to Nolan. He demands that she chloroform herself before they leave.

Emily flashes back to childhood and finding an injured bird on the porch. She wakes up handcuffed next to Nolan in the cell. The white haired man threatens to hurt Nolan and she tells him where the evidence is located. The key is on her keychain and she says there is an E-mail programmed to expose him in exactly one hour.

The white haired man leaves to check on the evidence. Emily quickly retrieves a thin piece of metal from the weave of her sweater, picks the lock on her cuffs and lets Nolan free. She is going to stay, while his job is to deliver information to the Feds.

Charlotte is strangely nice to Declan and Jamie. She tells him ""I'm happy for you.""

Jack shows up at Grayson Global and gives Daniel his check back. After he leaves Ashley hints that she knows something about Jack and Emily, and it looks like she's going to share it.

Charlotte comes home and looks up the number of an investigator. Identifying herself as Victoria, she has the man look into Jamie.

Conrad gives Lydia a ring, calling it a ""promise."" She accepts.

Nolan plants the evidence in the trunk of SEC investigator McCelan's car.

The white-haired man returns to find Emily sitting in a chair armed with an axe. They fight and eventually Emily gets the upper hand, sitting on top of the man with the axe on his windpipe.

Just as she is about to choke him to death she flashes back to setting the bird free with her father. David told her his favorite thing about her is the way she loves. She lets the white haired man live.

Victoria tells her SEC agent buddy that she can't take credit for the evidence finding its way to him. He tells her that Lydia has recanted her testimony. Victoria is confident she can work on her. The agent then drops the bombshell that Conrad contracted to have David killed.

Emily comes home to a very angry Daniel. He asks her if she kissed Jack and she admits it. She tells him the truth is that ""I'm not the person you fell in love with."" She points out that he's becoming what he never wanted to be, ""a Grayson"" and gives back the ring. She apologizes and he leaves.

The white-haired man tells Conrad that he had nothing to do with the evidence finding its way to the SEC. While Emily watches, he tells Conrad he's on his way to the airport and suggests he might want to do the same.

Daniel tells Victoria that he broke things off with Emily. He tells Victoria he didn't turn over the evidence and wants her not to testify. She tells him about Conrad having David murdered. Daniel responds that both of them have done terrible things, but at least Conrad's were in the best interest of the family. She thinks she is finally righting a terrible wrong and ""nobody will stand in my way.""

Victoria calls Lydia and suggests she rethink aligning herself with Conrad and promises she'll be coming for her after she's done with her husband. Conrad walks into the room and Lydia tells him her father had a heart attack and she needs to go home. He offers to give her a ride or use of his plane, but she declines. He says he understands perfectly and gives her a kiss.

Nolan mentions to Emily that it seems all that is left is Jack. She says she plans to tell him ""everything."" Emily gives Jack a call and says she'd like to stop by that night. Nolan and Emily toast her father.

Evidence is mailed to everybody in school that Jamie had a relationship with a teacher at her old school. Declan confronts Charlotte, telling her she's just like Victoria, and that he never wants to speak with her again.

Victoria drops by to see Emily and says perhaps now the two of them can move on. When Emily suggests Victoria take back her engagement gift, Victoria tells her to open it. The box was empty and Victoria says she knew that Emily's future with Daniel was as empty as the box.

Emily gives Sam's collar to Jack, prepared to tell him everything. But out of the other room walks Amanda, who is pregnant. She gives a stunned Emily a hug, then says ""Jack and I are going to have a baby."" Emily says congratulations and leaves quickly. Outside the bar she tries to fight back tears.

Daniel has Ashley over for a drink. She wonder if she made a mistake telling him about observing Emily and Jack, but Daniel is happy he knew the truth sooner rather than later.

Before Victoria leaves for Washington, Charlotte asks her mother if getting retribution ever made her feel better. Victoria said it does when the party deserved it and tells Charlotte to forgive herself and move on.

Conrad bursts through the door and tries to convince Victoria not to testify because of what will happen to their children. When she brings up David's death, he says that order came from far above him. He promises her that if she boards the plane ""it will be the last thing you do."" She says ""then I guess I'll see you in Hell.""

Emily tells Nolan about Amanda's pregnancy. He says he's coming over and makes her promise not to do anything ""revengey"" until he gets there.

Victoria boards the plane. Beneath the jetliner a worker removes the chock from one of the landing gear, and as he leaves, he removes his watch cap. It is the white haired man.

We see Conrad place a picture of Victoria and Lydia in the fire.

Charlotte watches a news report with word that her mother was killed in a plane crash. She calls Declan, who hangs up on her without listening to why she's calling.

Conrad rushes in to find Charotte unconscious with an empty pill vial beside her on her bed, appearing to have died.

Nolan arrives to find Emily beside herself that the evidence that could have exonerated her father was on the plane that just exploded. He tells her that he backed-up and unencrypted the hard drive before turning it over to the SEC. It turns out that after the Graysons framed David, the Initiative handled the cover-up. It goes much deeper than the Graysons. We see video of Victoria referencing that there being ""more to the story"" of David's wife when they met. Emily asks ""what is she saying? that they killed my mother too?"" Nolan replies, ""No, what she's saying is that uh.. your mother's alive."" Emily's mother isn't dead after all. Emily blankly stares at the computer without a single tear dropping and says, ""let it play."" Scene cuts to black and the first season concludes."

End of the 2nd century and Rome is massive and powerful. 20% of Earth's population (50 MM people) lives within Roman boundaries. It is ruled by Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Marcus was considered a successful emperor and a distinguished philosopher. Roads, Aqueducts and sewers made Rome technologically advances and kept the Empire together. Rome was 1 MM people strong and growing. Marcus made the mistake of wanting his decadent son Commodus to succeed him as Emperor rather than adopting someone qualified and trained, as his predecessors had done (as no emperor in the last 80 yrs ever had a son, so they adopted). Commodus was spoiled, engaged in drunken orgies. Faustina (Lisa Chappell), his mother, sends Commodus to Germania to learn discipline from his father.

Germanian tribes were attacking roman boundaries without restraint and had to be stopped. This had been going on for 250 yrs, and a decisive solution was needed. The Roman success lay in getting entrenched and building infra along the front lines, that allowed them to sustain war for prolonged duration. Despite Commodus being irresponsible, Marcus had no hesitation in promoting him at a young age. Marcus was simply not able to see that his son was not upto the task of being a Roman Emperor (Historians debate if it was simply fatherly love or naivete that somehow Commodus would turn out to be a good Emperor). While Commodus is being trained, Germanic tribes band together and attack Roman front lines. Thousands die on both sides. The war keeps dragging on. Marcus falls ill and news is dispatched to Rome. But the message is distorted and the news reaches that Marcus has died. Faustina knows Commodus is not ready for the throne and she has to protect her family. Lucilla (Tai Berdinner-Blades) is Faustina's daughter.

Roman senate is made of the most influential people of the Empire, each ambitious to further their own career. Lucilla was 12 yrs older to Commodus, married to Marcus's top advisor and was jealous of the prominent role being given to Commodus. Faustina decides to withdraw to Egypt. Lucilla knows that Faustina is abandoning her to protect herself and Commodus. Egypt is rich, governed by Avidius Cassius, with an army of 15,000 men. Avidius was a trusted man of Marcus. Faustina reaches Egypt and seduces Avidius. She backs Avidius as the emperor, in exchange for protection for Commodus. Avidius raises as Army of 7 legions (Egypt, Judea, Arabia and Africa) and marches to Rome. It is then revealed that Marcus is still alive in Germania. Avidius has no option but to continue towards Rome. But Faustina decides to visit Marcus at Germania. Faustina maintains that she has been loyal and faithful to Marcus, but he turns his back towards her. Marcus has Avidius assassinated and Faustina poisoned.

Commodus dearly loves his mother and is aghast that Marcus has eliminated her."

Faustina is cremated. Marcus has been Emperor for 14 yrs now. Marcus wants Commodus back in Rome, but this time Commodus says he wants to stay in Germania. Commodus starts taking his training more seriously. Since the start of the Empire, success of the Emperor depends on his control of the army. Only a skilled warrior can gain the respect of his troops. By having Commodus train in Germania, Marcus ensures that his troops are familiar & comfortable with Commodus. After being trained as a soldier, Commodus returns to Rome with MArcus.

Emperor's needed the Senate to run the empire, administratively. Senate had 600 men, with seats passed down through generations. Senate controls the treasury, conducts trials and advises the Emperor. Cassius Dio (Edwin Wright) and Quintianus serve the Senate under Marcus. Marcus needs more funds to continue the Germanic campaign. Cassius and Quintianus support Marcus's request for more funds to maintain their own position in Rome. Next, Marcus needs to find a Queen for Commodus. Marcus selects Bruttia Crispina (Ella Becroft), born into ROme's most influential family. She is the daughter of Marcus's advisor, a man who has been consul twice. This way, after MArcus is dead, Commodus will still have support amongst the Senators of Rome. But this match comes in the way of Lucilla's ambitions. The wedding takes place with great pomp and splendor.

But while Marcus and Commodus are away, the war in Germania escalates and German tribes break through Roman defenses. Pertinax was in command in Marcus's absence. Marcus is forced to return to Germania to take command. Commodus also goes with him. As soon as Marcus reaches Germania, he falls sick. Marcus has the Antonine plague. The disease spread quickly through the empire due to its roads. 2000 people per day die in Rome at the peak of the disease, 25% of all infected perish. 5 MM Romans die and the army is almost wiped out. Marcus knows Commodus is still not ready to survive as Emperor, but there is no more time. Marcus dies In 180 AD telling Commodus to finish the war before going back to Rome. Marcus dies at 58, being Emperor for 20 yrs. He was regarded as a good Emperor of Rome and held in high regard by its people.

After Marcus, the losses in Germania continue to mount. The generals cant agree on a single, unified course of action to push back the Germans. Commodus has no interest in the war, as he has already seen 10 yrs of it. Cleander (Jared Turner) and Saoterus (Calum Gittins) are Commodus's closest friends and former slaves, who are promoted to the highest ranks in the Imperial palace. Cleander and Saoterus advise Commodus to be in Rome to assert his claims and dominance. Commodus had promised his father to end the war. To keep the promise, he makes a treaty with the Germanic tribes, which pushes them back from the border and forces many enemy soldiers to enlist in the Roman army. People liked the peace, but the military and senate were against the treaty. Commodus returns to Rome."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6238676/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,"Commodus rises to power as Rome's new emperor, but not everyone supports his ascent. Among those conspiring against him: his older sister Lucilla.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Richard Lopez'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Commodus rises to power as Rome's new emperor, but not everyone supports his ascent. Among those conspiring against him: his older sister Lucilla.

Commodus returns to ROme in 180 AD and is crowned Emperor in a public ceremony. Lucilla begins to seduce members of the senate (in bed) to gain influence. As the elder sister, she believed she had a better claim to the throne as compared to Commodus. Commodus realizes the politics at play to keep the throne. The demands of the Crown begin to weigh on him. Commodus plans to buy the loyalty of the military with a lavish gift. Historically, new emperors have given gifts like money, land and slaves to the soldiers to buy their support. But now, the treasury is controlled by the senate.

Senators Quintianus and Cassius Dio (Edwin Wright) support the plan in senate, but Commodus has no clue which lands to give to the military. So, Cassius and Quintianus take the allocation and distribution of land in their own hands. Quintianus was under Lucilla and planned to undermine Commodus by getting the senate to take credit for the gifts to the military. Cleander and Saoterus inform Commodus about the notification from Senate to the military, announcing the gift on the behalf of the Senate and not the emperor. Cleander wants to kill some senators to send a message, but Saoterus convinces Commodus to strike where it will hurt more, money. Commodus asks the senate to host a day of gladiator games (Starting with public executions, shows of wild exotic beasts, beast vs man or beast, and finally gladiatorial contests) as a gift to the people. When Senators say that games are expensive, and people cant be taxed for games, Commodus devises a plan to tax the senators to pay for the full cost of games

Quintianus is furious. And Cleander feels slighted when Commodus favors Saoterus's opinion more than his. Saoterus advises Commodus to focus on gaining support of the people. Commodus issues coins with his profile and launches statues of himself all over Rome. Lucilla and the senate's resentment peak at the same time and she plots with Quintianus to assassinate Commodus. Quintianus refuses to partake in this plot, of murdering a sitting emperor. Meanwhile Commodus rewards Saoterus with a signet ring, one of the highest honors in the palace (the signet ring was used to certify all documents from the emperor and now Saoterus had this power). This further alienates Cleander. Commodus appoints Saoterus to represent him in the senate, which the senate takes as an insult (Since Saoterus was formerly a slave). Not including the Senate in his inner circle was a major decision that Commodus made during his reign. Quintianus decides to partner with Lucilla to kill Commodus.

Cleander seduces Lucilla's chambermaid and finds out about her plot to kill Commodus. Cleander meets Lucilla and aligns with her in the plot to kill Commodus. Quintianus plans to kill Commodus at the games. Cleander promises to take out Saoterus, to eliminate any obstacles in their way. On the day of the games, Cleander takes Saoterus to a whore house. Saoterus falls asleep drunk and Cleander kills him in his sleep. Meanwhile Quintianus attacks Commodus when he comes to the basement of the Coliseum, after the games have begun."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6238678/?ref_=ttep_ep4,,"Commodus defeats his sister's coup but withdraws from governing, allowing others to amass power while he engages in an affair and banishes his wife.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Richard Lopez'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Commodus survives Quintianus's attack and captures him. Cleander reaches the palace and informs Commodus that they were ambushed by the plotters and Saoterus was killed in the attack. As Quintianus is tortured, Cleander cuts off his tongue to eliminate any chance of Quintianus naming Cleander in the conspiracy. Quintianus is killed and Cleander tells Commodus that Lucilla was involved in the plot.

Commodus confronts Lucilla, who admits that she plotted against Commodus as she was angry at being cast aside once Commodus was born. She wishes that Marcus would have set aside centuries of tradition (to put a male member of the royal family on the throne) and seen her as the worthy heir to the throne. Commodus spares Lucilla, but banishes her from Rome, to the Island of Capri (100 miles from Rome). Lucilla lives in exile. Shortly thereafter Commodus has her murdered on the Island. Cleander is promoted to chief advisor to Roman Emperor. Commodus displays that he is easily manipulated and instead of leading himself, he is put aside and led by people like Cleander.

Commodus withdraws into a shell. he even shuns his wife Bruttia since she has failed to give him a son. As Commodus grows more detached, Cleander continues to consolidate his power. Cleander begins selling off high ranking positions in the Empire, to amass a fortune for himself. he even sells seats in the Roman senate. With this move, Cleander buys the loyalty of the Senate and disturbs the balance of an institution that has governed for 700 yrs. Commodus returns to his reckless ways and starts having sex with Bruttia's chambermaid Marcia (Genevieve Aitken). Marcia was a slave, and now becomes a concubine to the Emperor. Commodus then sends Bruttia away to Capri on pretext of a plague, so he can have unhindered access to Marcia.

Next, Cleander aims to gain favor amongst the masses. For centuries ROme existed on imported grain from Egypt and North Africa. This grain was given free to each citizen of Rome. This was used by the elites to keep control of the lower classes. Cleander devises a plan to hoard the imported grains and create an artificial famine and then release the grain, emerging as the savior of the city and a hero. But the shortage of grain and resulting hunger leads to return of the plague in the city. Thousands die. riots break out. As news of hunger reaches Commodus, he orders Cleander to double the subsidies and to import more grain (Commodus knows hunger leads to sickness and sickness leads to death & anger). Commodus still continues to trust Cleander and doesn't realize the danger he poses to ROme. Cleander still sticks to his plan and refuses to release the grain. The anger of the population grows and they vent it out in form of graffiti on city's walls. Cleander is named as the person responsible (the man in charge of the supply of grain) for this mess. Commodus finally wakes up and realizes that Cleander has done something to provoke the anger of the masses."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6238680/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,"A disastrous grain shortage reveals Cleander's treachery and leaves Commodus isolated, inspiring him to train as a gladiator in a bid to unite Rome.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Richard Lopez'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"A disastrous grain shortage reveals Cleander's treachery and leaves Commodus isolated, inspiring him to train as a gladiator in a bid to unite Rome.

Commodus arrests Cleander. Cassius argues that Cleander was behind the shortage of grain in Rome. He says that Cleander amassed the grain to release at the time of acute shortage to win the favor of the masses. Commodus is confused as he doesn't trust either Cassius or Cleander. Marcia eventually convinces Commodus that Cleander is lying. At the trial Cleander still argues that he is loyal to Commodus, until Cassius produces the chambermaid whom Cleander seduced and found out about Lucilla's plot against Commodus. The Chambermaid says she is testifying against Cleander as the grain shortage killed her mother and that Cleander knew of the plot to kill Commodus and joined the plotters. She says that Cleander killed Saoterus.

Commodus kills Cleander on the spot. with Cleander gone, Commodus had no friends left. The people hated him and the senate hated him. He had to go. Cleander's body is decapitated and dragged through the streets of Rome. Now, Commodus has no friends left and he turns to Cassius for advise. Cassius advises against waging wars or giving more gifts to the people. Cassius asks Commodus to trust the senate, but Commodus refuses to trust anyone anymore. Just as things couldn't get worse, a passing storm and lightening sets off a massive fire in the middle of the city. People see this as a sign of divine wrath and retribution. The Gods were angry with Commodus. The fire consumes many religious shrines and government buildings.

Commodus realizes only he can save Rome now. Commodus announces a plan to rebuild the city and to mark this with 14 days of Plebian games. Commodus announces his intention to participate in the games as a gladiator. The Senate protests since gladiators are slaves. Cassius decides to assassinate Commodus at the games. Commodus enlists a skilled gladiator Narcissus (Mike Edward) to train him to fight in the Coliseum. Narcissus is a celebrated gladiator in his own right. Narcissus starts training Commodus very hard. Narcissus also tells Commodus how he created a persona of invincibility around him and he won fights before even entering the arena. Commodus finds out quickly that he is no match for Narcissus, who is far more skillful. Even months of practice is not able to change that mis-match. He is not ready for the arena.

Cassius feels that with this announcement, Commodus has gone too far in insulting tradition and undermining the Senate. He reaches out to Marcia, who had grown in her stature as a significant advisor to Commodus. Marcia's husband Eclectus has become an advisor to Commodus as well, and has seen his wife frequently in bed with Commodus. On the eve of the games, Commodus holds a feast for the gladiators and gives a rousing speech on how these 14 days of games will change the future of Rome. Commodus decides to enter the arena, not knowing if he will exit alive."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6238682/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,"Lavish imperial games at the Colosseum are highlighted by the emperor's bloody victories, but his paranoid abuses of power lead to a final betrayal.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Richard Lopez'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"On the first day of the games, Commodus rewards Narcissus and grants him his freedom, thereby eliminating his biggest threat from the games. With this Commodus earns the adulation of the crowd, since Narcissus was a crowd favorite. 50,000 Romans cheer the games in the Coliseum. 100's exotic animals are hunted live. Prisoners and slaves are executed. Gifts and prizes for those in attendance. Commodus portrays himself as Hercules to project an image of invincibility. Commodus is pinned down in his first fight, but using his wits, he throws sand in the eyes of his opponent and then spears him to death. For the first time an Emperor claims victory as a gladiator at the Coliseum. Commodus wins the validation he always wanted.

With his new found confidence, Commodus calls for the meeting of the senate and announces that the Senate will be disbanded by the new year. He calls the Senate outdated and a bunch bickering and backstabbing old men, who should have been removed when Caeser took the throne as the Emperor. Commodus's new vision for Rome was to turn it into a dictatorship. Commodus commissions massive golden statues and renames the months of the year after himself. He renames Rome to Colonia Commodiana.

Commodus wins every one of his fights at the Plebian games and his megalomania grows. What the crowds didn't know that in the arena, his opponents were given dulled blades by Eclectus and had no chance of hurting him. Narcissus knew what Commodus was doing and was not happy. Narcissus confronts Commodus and ensures that he understands that Narcissus doesn't support what Commodus has done to kill his brothers (in trade as gladiators). Commodus argues that he granted the gladiators the honor to die by his sword in the service of the Empire. Commodus knows if his secret is let out, he will lose the trust of the people, so he draws up a list of names of people who knew of the truth.. These people were to be banished or executed. The Proscription List.

Eclectus and Marcia reach out to Cassius and reveal Commodus's secret. Cassius gives poison to Marcia and tells her to mix it in Commodus's wine. Marcia was afraid for her own life, and agreed to Cassius's plan. Poison is untraceable and hence an insidious form of assassination in the Roman world. Marcia serves the poisoned wine to Commodus, who drinks it. But he vomits the wine out and is not killed. Marcia finds the Proscription list and finds her own name on it. She escapes with the list. Eclectus takes the list to Cassius. Cassius finds that his own name is also on the list.

Cassius engages Narcissus and orders him to assassinate Commodus. Narcissus meets Commodus in his chamber and challenges him to a fair fight, hand to hand combat. Narcissus beats Commodus and then stabs him to death. Commodus's death plunges Rome into turmoil. For the next yr, Rome is consumed by Civil war and all those who plotted against the Emperor are punished. Narcissus is executed. Marcia is sentenced to death. Cassius survives and writes an account of this time of the ROman Empire. Commodus brought peace to Rome in 13 yrs of his rule, but was remembered as the man who brought unprecedented chaos and beginning of the fall of the Roman Empire."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0827590/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,Cleo and Emma meet a new girl named Rikki and they end up on eerie Mako island where a magical transformation occurs.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Colin Budds'],"['', '', '']",[],"['oceania', ""character repeats someone else's dialogue"", 'island', 'mermaid', 'tutor', 'full moon', 'pool', 'cave', 'keeping a secret', 'ice water', 'glass of water', 'fire hydrant', 'trail bike', 'research', 'computer', 'swimming with dolphins', 'biology', 'knocking on a door', 'sprinkler', 'bath', 'beach', 'boat', 'megaphone', 'water police', 'police siren', 'searchlight', 'swimming with clothes on', 'pulled into water', 'swimming underwater', 'dormant volcano', 'falling into a cave', 'falling down a hole', 'waterfall', 'mobile phone', 'spider', 'snake', 'mangrove', 'paddling a boat', 'out of fuel', 'offering a ride', 'canal', 'splashed with water', 'water spray', 'engine start', 'spark plug', 'engine trouble', 'inflatable boat', 'marina', 'personal best', 'swimming laps']",[],"Emma Gilbert (Claire Holt) dives into a pool and swims a lap, watched by her friend Cleo Sertori (Phoebe Tonkin). Cleo has a stopwatch running, and when Emma touches the side of the pool, Cleo stops the watch and shows Emma the time, which Emma informs her is under her personal best. Cleo tells Emma that she was really motoring during her lap. Emma replies that she will do better than that tomorrow, and that with another two weeks, she will be ready for the regional trials.

Later, Cleo is walking along the harbour at the Runaway Bay Marina when Zane Bennett (Burgess Abernethy) asks her if she can help him because he is having some trouble with the motor on his inflatable boat. Cleo replies that she doesn't think she can help. Zane pleads with her, saying that all he needs is for her to pass him the tools. Cleo says that she is not good with boats, but Zane replies that she will be fine.

Cleo steps in to the boat, and while she searches the toolbox on board, Zane unties the boat from its mooring. He tells Cleo that it took him a while to realise that someone had stolen his spark plug. Cleo finds something inside the toolbox and asks Zane if it is like that, but when she turns around to show him, she realises that the boat has started drifting away from the harbour. Zane answers with a no and tells her no spark plug, no spark. As his friend Nate (Jamie Timony) joins him on the harbour, he tells Cleo that he was getting sick of that boat anyway. Cleo asks Zane why her, as she didn't steal his spark plug. Zane's only explanation is because she was there, and his dad will buy him another boat anyway. He then says that if Cleo can get it going, she can keep it, but Cleo replies that it isn't funny, to which Zane answers that it works for him.

Cleo yells at Zane as the boat starts to drift out of the harbour, but Zane suggests that Cleo will have to swim for it. As Cleo denies that it is happening, Rikki Chadwick (Cariba Heine) takes a leap off a nearby pier and lands in the boat. Cleo screams at her sudden appearance, then asks Rikki if it is supposed to be a rescue, because it has one fatal flaw - without meaning to state the obvious, they are both just floating out to sea. Rikki produces a spark plug that she took, and as she steps towards the motor, she tells Cleo that Zane Bennett is a pig and anything she can do to get under his skin can't be a bad thing. As Rikki fits the spark plug to the motor, Cleo thanks her. Rikki is surprised that Cleo knows her name, and Cleo explains that she had seen Rikki around school since she arrived, and had meant to say hello. Rikki replaces the engine cover, tells Cleo to hold on, then starts the motor and drives the boat back into the harbour. As they pass Zane, Rikki revs the enging up and turns the boat around, sending a large spray of water flying towards him. The two girls chuckle while Zane can only look at Nate.

Rikki and Cleo take the boat for a spin around the waterways of the Gold Coast and wave to another passing boat. As they ride along one canal they see Emma, and Cleo asks her if she wants a ride. Emma replies by asking Rikki if she is licensed, to which Rikki asks Emma if she is her mother. With all three of them aboard, Rikki asks if they want to go out to sea. Emma asks if that is dangerous in a craft their size, but Rikki tells her to chill out as she guns the motor.

Later, the motor on the boat stops, and the propeller struggles to turn when Cleo tries to get it started again. Emma asks Rikki if she is chilled out yet. Rikki points out that they are floating, not sinking, to which Emma answers not yet. Rikki thinks that they may be out of fuel and asks if they want to paddle to an island that they can see in the distance, which Emma recognises as Mako Island. Emma suggests that they forget it, and Cleo adds no one goes there, and the island is surrounded by sharks, reefs and mangroves. Rikki answers by telling the other girls that it is all they have, as she produces a couple of paddles. They start paddling towards the island.

Emma pulls the boat up on the island's shore and Cleo asks how they will get home. Emma tells her to ask her friend, but Rikki tells them not to put it on her, leading Emma to sarcastically suggest that it was someone else was at fault for taking the boat a long way offshore. She then produces a mobile phone and tells the other girls that they are lucky that she has it. Cleo explains that Emma is always prepared, to which Rikki answers that she is so happy for her. Emma can't get a signal on the phone and suggests that they should head for higher ground. She and Cleo set off, and Rikki follows them a few seconds later.

As they trek further into the island, Cleo asks Emma if she has any idea where she is going, but all Emma knows is that it's just up. She is still not getting a signal, and Cleo asks her what she will do if she can't get a signal at all, they can't call anyone and nobody finds them, to which Rikki answers that they'll have to draw straws and decide which one of them the others will eat, an idea that Cleo doesn't find funny. It's Rikki's way of trying to relieve the tension, but Cleo says that it is making things worse.

As they continue their climb upwards, they come across a waterfall. Still leading the way, Emma tells the other girls to mind their step. She then jumps across the water and lands on the other side, and Rikki follows her soon after, but Cleo is scared of following them because it is too slippery, and suggests that there has to be another way. She then slips and falls down a path that leads into a cave. Emma and Rikki rush to where Cleo fell in and see where she had landed.

Cleo sits up and tells Emma and Rikki that she is OK, but when they ask her if she can climb up, she tells them that she can't because it's too steep. Emma suggests that she will have to go down and get Cleo, to which Rikki asks if she is crazy. Emma starts the climb down but soon slips and lands close to Cleo in the cave. Emma asks Cleo if she is OK, to which Cleo replies that her leg hurts a little. Emma thinks that it is probably just sprained. Suddenly Rikki also slips and falls into the cave beside Emma and Cleo. Emma asks Rikki what she is doing there, and when Rikki tries to explain that Emma came down, Emma tells her that she was meant to stay up top and throw down a rope or something, to which Emma asks if she is a mind reader, and what rope. Cleo suggests that the three girls should all concentrate on getting out of the cave, an idea to which Rikki agrees.

Night falls as the girls continue their exploration. One of them thinks there is no way out, but Emma finds another passage for the girls to try. Her path brings them to the edge of a pool of water. Taking in the sight, Rikki says ""Wow"", and on looking up, suggests that it is like the cone of a volcano. Cleo asks if it is going to erupt, but Emma answers that it has been dormant for 20,000 years, so she thinks they are safe. They walk around the edge of the pool, and stooping down, Emma notices some tidal rings, which suggests to her that the pool is connected to the ocean, and may be a way out. She takes off her shoes and dives into the water. Cleo tells Rikki that she is not going to like this.

Later, Cleo calls out to Emma, but Rikki tells her to relax and give Emma a minute. Emma returns to the surface and tells the girls she was right - it's about a 20 second swim to the reef outside, it is straight through and there is plenty of room for them all to fit. When Cleo looks at where they have to go through, she is scared about the idea, but Rikki points out that there is no other way out, and tells Cleo she can do it, to which Cleo counters that she can't swim. Outside, the light of the full moon is passing close to the cone of the volcano, as Emma tries to reassure Cleo that everything will be fine. Cleo asks Emma how she can be sure, but Rikki tells Cleo to listen to Emma, pointing out that their only alternative is to be stuck down there forever. Rikki stretches a hand out to Cleo, who takes it and allows Rikki to pull her into the pool. At that moment, the full moon appears over the top of the volcano and bathes the girls in its light. Some bubbles appear on the surface of the pool and rise up towards the top of the cone, which leads Cleo to say ""Wow"", and Emma to remark that it is spooky, before she tells the other girls to concentrate and take a deep breath. Emma goes under first, then Rikki leads Cleo along the passage out. All three of them emerge out in the sea, with Cleo suggesting that it was more than 20 seconds, but she is told to relax, with Rikki saying that she is proud of her, and knew she could do it. They are then bathed in a searchlight as they are found by the water police, who tell them to make their way to the boarding ladder at the rear of the boat. Emma and Rikki swim toward the rescuing vessel, and Cleo soon follows them.

After the sun rises, Emma heads to the beach for a swim, diving under the water and them coming back up. Suddenly, she looks down, sees some bubbles, and seconds later, finds that she has grown a tail where her legs would normally be. Meanwhile, inside her bath, Cleo finds herself similarly transformed, as her little sister Kim (Cleo Massey) knocks on the door and tells Cleo that she cannot stay in there forever. As Rikki goes for a walk, she gets sprayed with water from a nearby sprinkler, and soon finds herself falling over onto the sprinker's hose, cutting off its supply of water. She looks back and sees that she also now has a tail.

Later, back as their normal selves again, the three girls are together at Cleo's house describing their experiences and wondering what has happened to them. Rikki asks Cleo if there is anyone else there, and Cleo replies that her father is at work and her sister and mother are shopping. Emma asks what happened to them, and Rikki observes that ten seconds after they touch water, they grow a fin. Cleo adds her observation that it vanishes when they are dry, and confirms that it is the same for Emma and Rikki. They all agree about their appearance, but Rikki is the first to describe them as mermaids, a word that leads Emma to tell her that she is not funny because mermaids don't exist, and she finds the idea too weird.

Suddenly, there is a knock on the door, and Cleo realises that she had forgotten that school tutor Lewis McCartney (Angus McLaren) was coming to help her with biology. He enters and sees Emma and Rikki with Cleo and asks if he got the time wrong. Cleo confirms that they agreed to 9 o'clock as the time, but tells Lewis that something important has come up, but it isn't so important that he needs to know about it, so she has to cancel their appointment. As Lewis prepares to leave, Cleo asks him if he knows anything about mermaids. He answers ""No, not really"", and Cleo then sees him out before returning to Emma and Rikki. Rikki thinks that Cleo is crazy for asking Lewis what he knew about mermaids, and Emma points out that if anyone finds out about it, they could be in big trouble. She then adds that something very strange has happened to them, but they don't know how, and they certainly don't know why, to which Rikki says that there is a way for them to find out more - to go back in the water, but it is an idea that Cleo doesn't wany any part of. On the other hand, Rikki is keen to go, but doesn't want to go alone, so she asks for volunteers.

Later, Emma and Rikki are standing on a rock near the beach, and Emma is not so sure about Rikki's idea, and the fact that Rikki is sure gives Emma no confidence whatsoever. They walk into the beach together, and ten seconds later, they find themselves changed into mermaids again. They spend a little time swimming in the sea among the corals, the fish and a dolphin.

Meanwhile, Cleo finds Lewis at a computer at the JuiceNet Café and asks what he is doing. Lewis replies that because she had asked, he thought he would do some research. The computer screen has some sketches of a variety of sea creatures, including a mermaid. Cleo suggests that Lewis didn't need to do that, to which Lewis answers that he has way too much time on his hands.

Later, Lewis and Cleo are walking together, and Lewis tells Cleo that mermaids have been around for at least 3,000 years. Cleo asks him if people really believed in that stuff, to which he replies that sometimes they were good omens, but sometimes they brought trouble with them. Cleo asks what kind of trouble, but before Lewis can answer, Zane shows up on a motorbike. Lewis tells Cleo to ignore him, and Cleo suggests that they should go back, but Zane rides along the path straight at Cleo and Lewis, forcing them to split to opposite sides of the path to avoid him. Zane asks them if they were nervous, and Cleo asks him what he wants. Zane tells them that his father didn't appreciate having the water police knock on his door, and Cleo replies that he shouldn't have told her to keep the inflatable boat. Zane says that he doesn't like people making him look bad, especially chicks like Cleo, which prompts Lewis to asks him if he means in front of his dad, adding that Zane sounds like he is scared of his father. Zane asks Lewis if he thinks he is better than him, while Cleo looks at a nearby fire hydrant. Lewis answers that almost everyone is better than him, and he should live with it. As Zane and Lewis walk towards each other, the fire hydrant starts to vibrate. Zane asks Cleo if she has found herself a protector, and taunts that it is not going to do her any good. As he speaks, Cleo stretches a hand out in the direction of the hydrant, and one of the valves begins to unscrew. Zane tells Cleo that one of these days, with or without Lewis, something really bad might happen to her, but at that moment, it is Zane who has something really bad happen to him when the valve comes off the hydrant and sends a huge jet of water spraying on him. The pressure of the water jet is enough to send Zane sliding down a nearby bank and into a stream. When Cleo moves her hand again, the water stops gushing out of the fire hydrant. Cleo leaves a suprised Lewis.

Emma and Rikki return after their ocean swim, with Rikki commenting how after they climb out of the water, everything is back to normal when they're dry, like nothing ever happened. Emma replies that it did, and Rikki says that it is going to change her life. When she asks Emma if there are any words for that, Emma. doesn't think so. Cleo arrives at that moment, telling the other girls to wait while she runs to join them telling them that they will never believe what just happened.

Inside the house, Cleo gets a glass of water and starts to make the water in the glass grow, right in front of Emma and Rikki. Rikki asks Cleo where the extra water is coming from, but Cleo answers that she doesn't know. As she does so, she takes her hand away from the column of water, and it starts to fall towards the other girls. Emma puts her hand up to fend it off, and suddenly, the column turns to ice. After a few seconds of shock, Emma asks if she did that, and Cleo observes that it wasn't her. Rikki remarks that it is over the top and she is getting tingles now. Emma says that all she did was to put her hand up, and as she does the same action, the water in a flower pot freezes. Rikki then tries pointing her hand at the water, but nothing happens. She remarks that it is unfair, and asks why the other girls get to do the cool stuff. Cleo thinks that cool isn't the word, but scary is. She tells the girls that they should have seen the look on Zane's face. Emma counters that it isn't funny, telling the other girls that they have to keep it a secret from everyone, otherwise they could end up dissected or in a circus. Cleo asks if the secret is between the three of them, to which Emma confirms that it is their secret and their responsibility, and no matter what happens, they are in it together. Rikki asks if it means that they are married, a point that Emma says is actually funny."

Cleo, who by now has become a mermaid, tells Kim that she will walk. She sends a picture of the clownfish to her two friends. Meanwhile, Rikki Chadwick (Cariba Heine) is out swimming with dolphins in the sea, and beginning to enjoy her new life as a mermaid.

Later, with the three friends together, Emma and Cleo struggle to come to grips with the fact that their new lives have some disadvantages - Cleo tells the group that they can never use moisturizers ever again because they are mainly water, and Emma says that she had to miss swimming training for the first time in six years. Rikki prefers to focus on the advantages - like dolphins, they can swim for miles underwater, even go all the way to Fiji. Cleo thinks that they have to tell someone, like their parents or a doctor, about their secret, but Rikki doesn't like the idea of mermaids in a straitjacket with moisturised skin, and Emma agrees that they cannot tell anyone, not even Cleo's mother, to whom Cleo usually tells everything, because it is too dangerous and people won't understand - they could be locked up because they are different, they can do things that other girls can't do, and other people are scared of them. Cleo agrees not to tell anyone, but wants to make an exception for her friend Lewis, but Rikki says that she cannot even tell him. Reluctantly, Cleo agrees, and tells her friends that she is really good at keeping secrets.

At school, the fashionable Miriam Kent (Annabelle Stephenson) hands out invitations to a party that she is planning to throw in honour of surfing god Byron, offering those who accept the chance to win a special prize. After she leaves, Lewis McCartney (Angus McLaren) arrives. Cleo tells him that nothing much has been happing apart from the same old things. Lewis asks Cleo if she is going to Miriam's party. Cleo initially says yes, but she changes her mind after Miriam returns to tell the girls to bring their best bikinis, as it's a pool party.

As the three friends walk together, Rikki tells Cleo that it's uncool to miss one of Miriam's parties, as she won't ask them again, although Cleo sees that as a positive. She knows about the dangers, but suggests that if she tells Lewis, he can look out for them. Rikki is against the idea, and tells Cleo that she did the right thing, and none of them are going, but Emma counters that they should go, not for Miriam but for Byron. Because surfing takes a lot of hard work and training, Emma thinks Byron needs to know that everyone is supporting him. Rikki suggests that Emma likes Byron, but she dismisses the idea, leading Rikki to reply that Emma sounds like an advertisement for a breakfast cereal. Emma tells the group that if they can find out more about what is happening to them, they might be able to control it enough to go to the party, but Rikki thinks there is nothing more to learn - if they touch water, ten seconds later they will grow tails. Emma thinks it's about developing some discipline and exercising some control. Cleo likes the idea, and sends a text message to Lewis, but when Emma tells Cleo that she will have to swim if she wants to test the theory, it puts Cleo off the idea again.

Later at the beach, Rikki and Emma want to put the theory to the test, but Cleo doesn't want to join them in the water even though it's not even deep there. Emma leads Rikki in and tells her that controlled discipline starts with the mind, but even when they try concentrating, it can't stop them from growing their mermaid tails. Suddenly, they see Lewis carrying a fishing rod, and have to hide behind a rock in order to keep their secret from him. Lewis asks the girls who leaked to them about his secret highly classified fishing spot, and tells Cleo that he received her message. Cleo explains that it was an old message and she isn't going. Lewis is prepared to join the other girls for a swim, but Rikki tells him that she and Emma are naked. Lewis still thinks about a quick dip, but when Emma says goodbye to Lewis, he leaves telling them that the offer was there.

Back home, Cleo tells Emma and Rikki that they will never be invited to anywhere cool ever again, and all because they have tails. Emma adds that her swimming career is over. Cleo and Emma get glasses of water and cordial, and Cleo asks them why it has happened to her, adding that she didn't ask for it to happen, while she shows off her power of controlling the shape and volume of water. Emma replies that she too has problems, as she had been training to be a swimmer since she was six months old. As she speaks, she puts a stick in the middle of her cordial, uses her special power to make it freeze, then takes the stick out, giving her a glass-shaped frozen icy pole. Rikki is fed up with both of them, telling them that anybody else would love to have the amazing powers that they do, but all they do is whinge, while she doesn't even have a power, but she isn't complaining about it. She then storms off after telling them that she doesn't want to hang around with whingers. Cleo tells Emma that she knows how Rikki feels - sometimes, even she doesn't want to hang around with herself!

At the JuiceNet Café, Cleo asks Lewis what he thinks about Rikki, to which he answers that she reminds him of stonefish, who can look like a rock yet are capable of shooting enough poison to kill a football team in half a second. They then hear some applause and see that Byron (Christopher Poree) has just arrived at the café. Cleo is the first to congratulate him, and asks him what his ranking is now, but Zane Bennett (Burgess Abernethy) tells Cleo to control herself. Lewis then remarks that Zane is dry, and tells him that it must feel different. Zane confronts Lewis and tells him that he didn't know what happened with the fire hydrant, but if Lewis mentions it again, Zane will remove Lewis's head from his shoulders. As Zane leaves, Lewis grabs his right shoulder, but after Cleo tells Lewis to let it go, Byron steps in to calm things down, telling Lewis that Cleo is right, it isn't worth it, and it won't change Zane. Byron and Zane then leave, and Cleo tells Lewis that Byron is such a nice guy, and Emma was right - they should go to Miriam's party to show some support for him. Lewis thinks the idea is great, but he then tells Cleo that he doesn't get her - one minute she is going, then she is not, and now she is going again. He then grabs his drink and leaves.

Next morning, Emma's parents, Neil (Jared Robinsen) and Lisa (Caroline Marie Kenison), see her eating breakfast, and Lisa asks her if she is sure she can afford to miss swimming training again, while Neil reminds her that the regionals are coming up. Lisa tells Emma that she still trained when she had the flu, and even when she broke her wrist, she swam with one arm. Neil suggests that if she is that bad, she should see a doctor, but Emma tells him that she doesn't need a doctor. Lisa comes into the kitchen and tells Emma that she has been spending a lot of time in her bedroom and locked up in the bathroom lately, but when she asks if there is anything they need to talk about, Emma replies that it's nothing. Lisa tells her that it's all right for her to feel moody because she is at an age where she's going through a lot of changes, a point with which Emma agrees, telling Lisa that she got it in one.

Dressed in a shower cap and wetsuit, Cleo calls Miriam on her mobile phone to let her know that she will definitely be at her party - probably. When Miriam asks her what she will be wearing, she replies that it's something appropriate. After ending the call, Cleo grabs a bucket of water, waits for the second hand on the bathroom clock to arrive at the number 10, then pours the bucket of water over herself and rushes to grab a towel and dry herself off quickly, but when the second hand reaches 12, Cleo still changes into a mermaid.

At the JuiceNet Café, Lewis finds Rikki and asks her if he can sit. Rikki tells him that she hopes so, just not with her. In spite of this, he sits opposite her and, as a waiter delivers his soft drink, he tells her that he wants to know what is wrong with Cleo. Rikki asks him what makes him think that there is anything wrong, to which he answers that he has asked her if she wants to go to Miriam's party a hundred times, and every time she has changed her mind. Rikki suggests that maybe she doesn't like him, and asks him if he thought about that. The thought had crossed Lewis's mind, but when he had seen Cleo hanging around with Rikki, he thought that Cleo's standards must be low. Rikki tries to get him to leave, to which he asks her if she is going to tell him what's wrong or not. She refuses, and explains to him that she is not even speaking to Cleo at the moment, and is just trying to be alone right now. As she speaks, her hand is close to Lewis's drink, and suddenly smoke starts flowing from the top of it. A puzzled Lewis tries to grab the drink, but he finds that the glass is hot. He asks Rikki if this is her idea of a joke. Rikki doesn't answer, but a smile slowly spreads across her face. Later, at the beach, Rikki finds a small pool of water and stretches her hand out over it. The water starts to bubble before it turns into a vapour.

Having received a call from Rikki, Emma meets her near one of the Gold Coast's canals, tells her that she is glad she called, and apologises for all of the negative stuff that she had talked about before, as she is not normally like that, but Rikki answers that it's cool, and then tells Emma that there is something that she wants to show her. She takes her back to the beach, where they become mermaids, which makes Emma curious about what it is that Rikki is wanting to show her, but while they are hiding behind the rock again, they see Lewis arriving there with his fishing rod. He asks Emma and Rikki if they are naked again, to which they reply that they are having a bit of a girl talk, but this doesn't put Lewis off his idea of coming there to fish - he is having withdrawals and needs the relaxation, and if anyone is going, it's Emma and Rikki. They tell him not to push it and ask him if he should be following Cleo around, but he answers that he is totally over that and he doesn't know what has been going on with Cleo lately - she just can't make up her mind. At that moment, Lewis receives a text message, which turns out to be from Cleo, and as if to prove his point, the message says that she is coming to the party again. Emma and Rikki tell Lewis that he has to do them a favour and make sure that Cleo doesn't go to the party alone, and suggest that he call her back, but when Lewis refuses and says that he is there to fish, the girls tell him that she could be in trouble. He answers that he is not some lackey or all-purpose servant that they think they can tell what to do. As he speaks, he tries to call Cleo back but her phone is switched off. The girls repeat their view that Cleo could be in trouble and ask him if he likes her, and Lewis answers that he does in a friendship kind of way. In the end, he grabs his fishing gear and leaves.

Cleo turns up at the party dressed in a green coat with a pink scarf. Miriam reminds her that it's a pool party, and Cleo answers that she remembered, but she has a terrible cold, so she won't be swimming at all. She asks Miriam where Byron is, and she is sure that he will be there any minute. She asks if Cleo will really be keeping her coat on, to which Cleo answers that she can't be too careful with a cold. After she pretends to sneeze into a tissue, Miriam thinks it's not a good idea for Cleo to be with them as sick people make her feel sick, and the other girl with her also thinks Cleo should leave, but Cleo assures both of them that it's nothing and she can still party, but Miriam suggests that she should go outside, not touch anything, don't try any drinks and stay away from everybody.

Cleo then heads towards the pool, and it isn't long before she is seen by Zane and his friend Nate (Jamie Timony). who are looking for a bit of fun. Cleo tells them to get back, but Zane reminds Cleo that she had a good laugh when he got soaked the previous week, and now it is her turn. Cleo's protestations about not being able to go in the water because of her ""cold"" fall on deaf ears, even when she suggests that it could be the flu or pneumonia. Several other boys join Zane and Nate in surrounding Cleo.

When Lewis arrives at the party still with fishing rod in hand, it comes as a surprise to Miriam. Lewis explains that he had been cruising by and thought he would drop in. Miriam asks him why he has his fishing gear, and he replies that he never leaves home without it. Lewis asks Miriam if she has seen Cleo, and she answers that she is round by the pool spreading disease. Meanwhile, Zane and Nate start to swing Cleo with the intention of throwing her in the pool on the count of three. Lewis sees them and tells Zane to let Cleo go. He does so, but not without first sending her off in a motion that makes her fall into the pool. After she falls in, Lewis confronts Zane and asks him if he has a brain, but Zane says that Lewis had told him to let her go, and he let her go. Zane then leads the other party guests in going inside for a drink, leaving Lewis alone to rush to the side of the pool to meet Cleo. He apologises to her for what Zane did, but looking at her watch, Cleo tells him that there is something that he should know. Lewis replies that she doesn't need to say anything, to which Cleo answers that she really does. At that moment, the water behind Cleo starts to bubble, and she reminds him about how he said before that she had been acting strange, and tells him not to freak out. She then completes her transformation into a mermaid and tells Lewis that he may have to help her out. Lewis backs away at first, but Cleo tells him not to leave because she really needs his help. In the end he relents, and takes Cleo by the hand.

At that moment, Emma and Rikki arrive at the party and see Lewis and Cleo alone by the pool. When they ask Lewis where everyone is, he tells them that they have gone inside. This gives Emma an idea to make sure they don't come out and discover Cleo's secret - she uses her power to freeze the screen door closed. Lewis then struggles to pull the heavy Cleo out of the pool, and asks Emma and Rikki to help. They are forced to reveal their secret by telling him that they can't help because if they get wet, they will grow tails too. Putting in a little more effort, Lewis begins to pull Cleo out. Meanwhile, Zane tries the screen door and asks Miriam who locked it. Miriam is surprised by his question, telling him that it isn't locked, but when she tries it, the frozen door refuses to budge.

Having finally pulled Cleo out of the pool, Lewis remarks that he should have joined a gym. Rikki then tells Lewis to get back, and begins to steam-dry Cleo, who remarks at one point that it stings, but soon changes back to her normal self. Surprised, Cleo realises then that Rikki has found her power - only Emma had known about it before. When Lewis asks what is going on, Emma answers that they will explain later. The four friends leave, but not before Rikki uses her new-found power to evaporate all of the water from the pool, saying that she never liked pool parties anyway. Miriam and the other guests then arrive at the pool, having found another way out of the house, and find that it is empty, prompting Zane to suggest that Miriam check her heating system.

Cleo has removed her coat, no longer needing to pretend that she has a cold, when she and her three friends walk alongside the water. They are all surprised when Byron arrives with a surfboard in his arm. Cleo asks him why he wasn't at the party, a question that leaves Byron puzzled. Cleo explains about the pool party that Miriam had put on for him, and the name seems strange to Byron, though he presumes she is the blonde one. He then answers their question by telling them that parties are not really his thing, before he heads off to the water for a surf, while the three girls all find something nice to say about him.

Down at the beach, Emma, Rikki and Cleo threaten to maim Lewis if he tells anyone about their secret. Lewis answers that he isn't that stupid - if anyone found out, the girls would probably end up as scientific experiments. Emma then tells the group that she has quit the swim team, and Cleo knows how much it meant to her. Lewis then feeds back what he has learnt about the girls' powers - Emma freezes things, Cleo explodes things and Rikki boils things, and all of them grow tails. He comments that it is just too bizarre, and Emma agrees, remarking that sometimes it is good, and sometimes it is not so good. Cleo doesn't have a word for it, but Rikki has three: ""Totally, absolutely, awesome."""
