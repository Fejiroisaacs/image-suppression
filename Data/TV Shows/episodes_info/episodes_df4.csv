The story begins with Rubble riding his skateboard towards Katie's Pet Parlor, where Skye is getting her hair done, and Rocky is being dragged, one way or another, into taking a bath by Katie's pet cat Cali.

While repairing his ATV, Ryder soon gets a call from Cap'n Turbot, who reveals that his ship, The Flounder, has run aground, and if he cannot get it free, it could sink to the bottom of the bay. Ryder assures the Cap'n that they are on their way, and summons the pups to the Lookout. This saves Rocky from taking a bath, but leaves Cali annoyed by Rocky being saved from humiliation as she has to spread eagle to avoid going in herself.

Once the pups arrive, and Marshall wipes out in the elevator, Ryder tells them about the situation, complete with Cap'n Turbot's worry about the Flounder sinking, and asks for Zuma and Skye to help him out. Zuma will assist Ryder with attaching cables to the Flounder to pull it free from the rocks, and Skye will provide over-watch to look for the safest path through the rocks and back to Seal Island, so Cap'n Turbot can make repairs to his ship. The PAW Patrol deploys,, and head out to meet Cap'n Turbot.

Once the PAW Patrol get there, ropes are attached to the crane hook on the back of the Flounder. But, Ryder and Zuma have tugboat trouble, straining with all their horsepower, but the Flounder cannot be loosened as it has too much mass. Cap'n Turbot fixes that, heaving his walrus friend Wally out of the lower port and dumping him overboard, as Cap'n Turbot has been studying a few things on walruses, and needed Wally as his test subject. With Wally unloaded, Ryder and Zuma are able to pull the Flounder free, but then discover that it has a hull breach, and is sinking.

While Cap'n Turbot panics, Ryder calls Rocky for help. Rocky is back at Katie's, as Cali tries once more to get him to take a bath. But Ryder's call saves Rocky again, leaving Cali to get soaked, much to her frustration and exasperation. After being asked by Ryder to find something to patch the breach in the Flounder's hull, Rocky finds a spare piece of metal, and is airlifted by Skye to Seal Island to transfer the patch to Ryder and Zuma. But Skye flies so low over the water, Rocky pleads for her to go higher so he doesn't get wet. They soon make it to the island, transfer the patch to Ryder and Zuma, who then head back out to the Flounder.

By this point, Cap'n Turbot has begun to panic more, having put on a scuba mask, snorkel, and inflatable toy inner tube. Ryder and Zuma soon arrive, Ryder having put on his scuba gear, and they head down to patch the hole. While they do that, Cap'n Turbot prepares to either go down with the ship, or swim to safety, as he begins to play ""Taps"" through his snorkel like a trumpet to honor his ship, and salutes it as well. Ryder and Zuma soon resurface, having successfully put on the patch, and finish towing the Flounder back to Seal Island.

Cap'n Turbot is very grateful, and thanks the pups for their help. When he pets Skye, Rocky whimpers happily, asking for a good belly rub, and gets one from Cap'n Turbot, especially on his tickle spot.

Back at the Lookout, the pups go to have some fun, but Rocky ends up splashing into a muddy puddle. Knowing what happens next with unhappiness, Rocky is soon back at Katie's to finally get his long-awaited bath, ending the story as he at least tries to enjoy himself with a little help from Cali.

Pups Fall Festival:

As the story begins, Chase and Marshall are up at Farmer Yumi's, helping her with the harvest of her apple trees and pumpkin patches for the Fall Festival, with Marshall showing his excitement for the season. After Marshall tries to harvest apples higher in one tree, and gets sent flying by the flimsy branch that he grabbed hold of, he lands in the pumpkins and gets one on his head. At first, it looks as if Yumi is upset about that, but she is more worried about Bettina, whose weather sense is going off. When Yumi checks her cellphone's weather app, there's a snowstorm coming in, despite Chase's protests that it isn't winter yet. Worried that the three of them won't be able to finish harvesting the apples and pumpkins before the snow hits, and the Fall Festival will be ruined as a result, Chase and Marshall decide to call on the rest of the PAW Patrol for help and head back to the Lookout, with Marshall becoming stuck in the fence and stumbling out.

When they arrive and tell Ryder about the situation, he summons the rest of the pups. For once, only Rubble, Rocky, Zuma, and Skye (the latter two having a brief race and arguing over who won, with Skye flipping into the elevator) head to the Lookout's top, instead of all six pups. Chase and Marshall are already waiting, and in their uniforms, when the other pups join them. Once Ryder tells the pups about the situation, and Chase and Marshall voice their concerns as well, Ryder passes out their orders. All the pups are needed for this assignment, so the whole team deploys, but while the rest of the pups get their vehicles, Skye uses her pup-pack to keep up with them.

When the PAW Patrol reach the farm, Ryder assigns Marshall to use his ladder to harvest the apples, Rubble to carry the harvest to the barn to store it, Zuma and Skye to harvest the pumpkins, and Rocky to see if he can find a much easier way to harvest the apples instead of picking them one-by-one. Things seem to go fine, but it soon descends into chaos. At that point, Chase is requested to help pass out order to ensure everything goes smoothly. With Chase passing out orders, things go much better. But the snow soon starts to fall, and with so many pumpkins still in need of being transferred to the barn, Ryder makes a pumpkin-rolling contest out of it, with Zuma and Skye participating, while Rocky and Rubble take turns with finishing the apple harvest with Marshall. With that plan, the rest of the pumpkins and apples are harvested just in time, and Yumi thanks the PAW Patrol for all their help.

A little while later, after the snow melts, Mayor Goodway declares the Fall Festival open, and everyone enjoys themselves, except for Marshall, who ends up getting another pumpkin on his head by accident from Rubble, ending the story as Marshall unhappily replies ""I'm OK..."", since he got his head squeezed in pumpkins during the majority of the story."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3141282/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"The PAW Patrol pups are playing on the beach when they discover sea turtle hatchlings. Later, Cap'n Turbot needs help moving a beached baby whale back out into the bay.",[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],"['turtle', 'baby']",[],"Pups Save the Sea Turtles:

The story starts with Rocky and Zuma enjoying some beach time with Rocky practicing on Zuma's kite-surfing surfboard, while Katie builds a sandcastle. Alex soon runs by with a volleyball, and catapults Rocky onto Katie's sandcastle, wrecking it. Either way, no-one is hurt, and Alex asks if the pups want to play volleyball with him. They agree, but soon the ball bounces across the street, and Alex attempts to retrieve it. Knowing that Alex is too small to be seen by the drivers, Katie, Zuma, and Rocky are able to catch up and stop him from entering the street, reminding him to look both ways before crossing. Once a driver stops and honks to let them know that they can cross, Katie, Zuma, Rocky, and Alex head over to look for the volleyball. Instead, Rocky and Zuma smell something else, and upon investigating, hear something scratching underneath the sand. Moments later, a baby sea turtle pops up, having just hatched. Soon more begin to surface, and Alex nearly falls on one before the pups catch him. Katie is worried, as with the baby sea turtles needing to get to the sea, they have to cross the road, full of traffic, and deal with the hungry seagulls as well. Rocky and Zuma agree that this is a job for the PAW Patrol, and they go to find Ryder, while Katie keeps an eye on the turtles; and Alex.

At the Lookout, Ryder is helping Marshall and Rubble with washing Rubble's pup house/digger, when Marshall accidentally soaks Rubble when he can't hear Ryder's instructions to turn off his hose. Zuma and Rocky soon arrive, but when Marshall hears the word ""trouble"", he accidentally soaks Rubble again.

Once Zuma and Rocky are able to tell Ryder about the situation, Ryder agrees to help, and summons the rest of the pups. Marshall has his regular crash, smacking into the back of the elevator, and the pups are soon topside. Once there, Ryder briefs the pups on the situation, and tells them how they can help.

Chase will provide security and traffic detail, and Rubble will figure out an alternate means for the turtles to reach the sea without crossing the road and being vulnerable to the seagulls. The pups deploy, and when they reach the area, it is not long before the turtles start to cross the road. Chase roadblocks one direction with his truck, and blocks the other with his cones. With the turtles safe from traffic, Rubble gets to work clearing out the tunnel leading to the beach from beyond the road. As the first of the turtles reach the beach, Alex, who had been playing in an inflatable raft, suddenly wonders why there are down there, and sweeps them up in a bucket to return to Katie and Ryder. They are surprised by what Alex has done, and tell him about how sea turtles live in the sea, and need to go back there once they hatch. Realizing his error, Alex allows Ryder and Katie to release the turtles to begin heading towards the shoreline again.

Meanwhile, Rubble finishes clearing the tunnel, then gets to work on the entrance from the road by clearing out the sand with his pup-pack since his digger is too big for the smaller opening. While the pups are busy with the sea turtles, Alex maintains keeping the seagulls away from them so they can reach the sea safely. However, he soon notices Zuma's kite-surfing surfboard, and decides to head out for a ride on it, only for the wind to cause the board to lift off the water and go airborne since Alex was too light to keep in on the water. When Ryder and Katie hear Alex's cries for help, Skye is dispatched to retrieve him, and then goes airborne to help Alex. Skye is able to retrieve Alex safely, and returns him safely to the ground. Alex then gives Skye a good scratching to thank her for saving him.

A little while later, Rubble finishes clearing the tunnel, and the turtles soon start using it to bypass the street and reach the sea safely. The pups have done another good job, and have earned some beach time for it. As everyone enjoys some volleyball, Alex misses his catch as the ball bounces off his head, and he starts yelling and jumping up and down, like something is in his pants. When Katie and Ryder wonder what's wrong, Alex mentions something in his pocket, and pulls out the beach crab, joking that he sure is grouchy. Everyone laughs as the crab skitters away as the story ends.

Pups and the Very Big Baby:

The story begins with the pups enjoying themselves as always. Marshall, Skye, Rubble, and Rocky attempt to have a sliding contest, but the moment Skye attempts to climb up the steps of the playground slide, she leaps away with a yelp, as the heat has made the steps too hot. Marshall helps out by soaking the slide down with his water cannons, making it a water-sliding contest, and Rocky soon improves it with a slip-and-slide he had stored in his pup house.

Meanwhile, Ryder is giving Chase a good brushing, when they get a call from Cap'n Turbot, revealing that a baby whale has beached herself and he is doing his best to keep her wet so she doesn't dry out. Needing help, Cap'n Turbot asks the PAW Patrol for help, and Ryder says they are on their way. When the pups spot Marshall running in to join them in the elevator, they quickly part to ensure Marshall doesn't crash into them as always. The only crash is when Marshall smacks into the back of the elevator, and chuckles at how he made it as always.

Ryder calls the pups, reveals the situation, and dispatches Rubble and Marshall to help with the baby whale. As Skye shows empathy mentioning that the baby whale misses her mother, Rubble will attempt to clear a channel to help float the baby whale out to sea at high tide, while Marshall will help keep the whale wet until they can get it in the water again. The team deploy, and upon arriving, Marshall gets right to work, although the baby whale has some fun blowing Marshall across the beach when he gives it a drink and it spits it back out, right at him.

Rubble soon finishes the channel, and digs out the sand blocking the entrance for the water with his pup-pack. Soon, the tide starts to come in, but it's as high as it goes and not enough to reach the whale. Deciding they have to try and push the Baby Whale out, the plan fails as the Baby Whale sneezes everyone away as they attempt to push the first time. As they continue with keeping the whale wet, the PAW Patrol soon hear the mother whale coming. Fearing that she could get beached as well, they attempt to scare her off with loud noises. It takes Marshall's firetruck horn and siren to finally convince the mother whale to back off, but as Cap'n Turbot notices her starting to panic in worry for her baby, they know they need to get the baby whale back in the water. Remembering the slip-and-slide that Rocky used earlier, Ryder has him bring it down to the beach, unrolling it into the water, and Marshall soaking it down with his water cannons. With Rocky's help, another attempt at pushing the baby whale back into the water succeeds, and she is reunited with her mother. When the whale and her mother leave, everyone says goodbye, only for Rubble to start sobbing and tear up. Marshall asks Rubble what's wrong, but he begins to deny it.

Afterwards, when Ryder wonders who's hungry, Cap'n Turbot joins in the pups' agreement with a little too much enthusiasm, but calms down as he reveals he keeps some fresh squid jerky with him at all times. After offering Ryder some, and Ryder graciously saying no, Ryder gives the pups some treats, then agrees they earned some beach time for their hard work. The other pups join them later on, and soon, as they all eat, Zuma spots the baby whale, who lets off a plume of water in thanks, ending the episode as the pups and Ryder cheer, irising out on that good note."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3124362/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,"Ryder and the PAW Patrol rescue a lost kitty from the bay, but who will save them from all the mayhem she causes?/Ryder, Rubble, and Rocky call in Chase to help them free Katie and Cali's train from a rockslide!",[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],"['train', 'hyphen in title']",[],"Pups and the Kitty-tastrophe:

The episode starts with a crab walking along the beach. Rubble is then seen spinning around, and he's going to throw a Frisbee. Chase jumps up to catch it, but misses, lands on a volleyball, and falls into an umbrella. He then says ""Told you I got it."" A little squeaking noise is heard, and Rubble thinks it was Chase's tail that was making that noise. Chase says it wasn't him, but it was coming from the bay. A kitten is then seen floating out to sea on a toy boat. Rubble and Chase then run up to the bridge to get a better look, and they both decide to find Ryder and the rest of the pups to try and help.

At the Lookout, Skye is jump-roping with the assistance of Rocky and Zuma. As she is jump-roping, Skye sings: ""A. I am an aardvark. I come from Alabama, where I sell ant farms!"" Marshall then goes: ""B. I am a Baboon. I come from..."", but then trips on the jump rope, and falls, with his legs tied by the rope, causing all the pups to laugh.

Meanwhile, Ryder is kicking a soccer ball in the air, until Rubble and Chase show up, and assess the situation to him. Ryder then calls the PAW Patrol to the Lookout. As all their pup tags go off, Zuma and Rocky are trying to get Marshall unstuck, but as they are called, they start to just leave Marshall there. Marshall says he needs help, and Skye frees him.

Zuma, Rocky, Skye, and then Marshall all run into the elevator, with Marshall running up the wall and falling down to the ground. As Marshall is done falling, he says ""Made it.""

Once the PAW Patrol are topside, Ryder briefs them on the situation and assigns Zuma and Skye to help rescue the kitten.

Skye helps Ryder and Zuma locate the kitten. Ryder points her out, and Zuma and him rush over to the kitten. Ryder assures the kitten that everything will be OK, and picks up the toy boat out of the water. As Zuma says ""It's so cute"", the kitten hisses at him, and jumps on his head, and kicks him out of his hovercraft. ""Don't touch that, kitty, the hovercraft might... take off."" Zuma says as the kitten starts to drive his hovercraft. Ryder and Skye go on a goose-chase for the kitten. As she drives right towards them, Ryder tells Zuma to get ready to drive, as he jumps on the hovercraft, shuts it off, and takes the kitten out of the driver's seat. ""Don't worry kitty, everything is gonna be alright. You're all better."" Ryder says as he tells the kitty that they will get her back to dry land.

At the Pet Parlor, Katie is seen grooming Cali, and Rubble shows up, with the kitten they just rescued. Katie asks where she came from, and Rubble explains what happened. Rubble says the kitten needs a bath, and Katie says she will offer help, as kittens are hard to bathe. As Rubble offers the kitten a bath, she doesn't go into the water, and starts to wreck havoc around Katie's.

Ryder is then called by Rocky, who has found a girl who has lost a kitten named ""Precious"". Ryder realizes that the kitten they rescued is Precious, and she is seen skateboarding past Ryder as he realizes that. She skateboards past Mr. Porter, who is carrying a big cake to his delivery van. Mr. Porter manages to keep the cake steady as the kitten skateboards underneath him, but walks into his van, making a piece of the cake spill right on his head.

Rubble, Ryder, and Chase are looking for Precious. Rubble suggests Chase's ""super-sniffer"". Chase says, ""I need something with her scent on it."" Rubble gives Chase her ribbon, and Chase starts his hunt, sneezing all the way. They soon find Rubble's skateboard, and Chase stands on it, and says he knows that Precious was on it. ""Great sniffing Chase!"" Ryder says. As Chase thanks him, he sneezes, and the skateboard moves backwards, and Chase crashes into a curb. He then notices Precious, who is at the bell area of City Hall. Ryder calls Marshall, and says he needs his fire truck.

Marshall shows up to City Hall, and puts his ladder up. Ryder tells him to be careful. As Precious slips on the rope she jumped onto (the one that rings the bell), she jumps on Marshall, landing on his face, and causes the ladder to spin around in circles. Rocky and the little girl show up. Marshall turns around on the ladder, hits every rung on his way down, and is caught by Ryder. Precious falls, lands on Marshall's stomach, and bounces right into the owner's arms. The girl says the kitten that she needs to ""thank all the brave pups that saved you, and you too (referring to Ryder). You're all heroes!"" Ryder thanks her, and gives his line ""Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!"" Also, when Rubble was giving the ribbon back to the little girl, he was tearing up, sad to see Precious go.

Ryder tells the pups they were good, and they deserve treats. Rocky and Zuma start the jump-rope, and Skye starts first, flipping to get her treat. The Chase enters to get his, then Rubble, and Marshall, who gets tied up in the jump-rope when jumping up for his treat. Everyone laughs as Marshall is tied up to end the story.

Pups Save a Train:

The story begins with Chase and Rubble hard at work with the sand pit outside the lemonade stand on Main Street. As Rubble finishes smoothing out the sand, Alex and Precious' owner ask for a sandcastle, but Rubble chooses to create a sand replica of his digger instead. While Alex and Precious' owner argue over who will play Rubble with the sand digger, Chase and Rubble share a laugh over Rubble's love for being a construction pup.

Elsewhere, the train is on its way to the station in Adventure Bay. On board, Katie and Cali are enjoying the ride as they return from Katie's grandmother's house. Cali's stomach is growling, indicating she's hungry again, but Katie refuses to share any of the treats from her grandmother, as they are for the PAW Patrol. Cali's stomach growling soon gets louder, but a very loud rumble scares Cali, and even Katie. In the locomotive, the engineer, Mr. Hudson, sees something ahead and engages the emergency brakes. It's soon revealed that a rock-slide has occurred. Worse, one of the larger boulders rolls down, and smashes into one of the wooden support beams for the railroad bridge that the train is now stranded on, cracking it and weakening it. If it gives out, the bridge will collapse, with the train going with it. As Mr. Hudson tells her what happened, Katie calls Ryder to let him know.

At the Lookout, Ryder is busy playing video-games on his pup-pad, when he gets Katie's call. Wanting to make sure, Ryder looks through the Lookout's periscope towards the bridge. Once he sees the problem, Ryder lets Katie know the PAW Patrol are on their way, and summons them to the Lookout. Marshall manages to enter the elevator without a problem, but all the other pups come crashing into him. When they reach the top, Ryder tells them of the situation, and a replay of Katie's call worries Skye, but Ryder assures her they will get Katie and Cali home safe.

Rubble and Rocky will go with Ryder up to the bridge to clear the rocks away, while the other pups remain at the Lookout as backup.

When Ryder, Rubble, and Rocky arrive at the blocked track, while the pups get to work with the cleanup, Cali slips away from Katie to go after a bag of potato chips that a seagull was eating on the roof of the train. After faking out the seagull twice, Cali pounces, but misses, and the bag and chips fall into the river below, much to Cali and the seagull's sadness.

Meanwhile, Ryder goes to check the bridge, and discovers the damaged support beam. He asks Rocky if he can come down and help, but it is too steep for his recycling truck. Knowing they need more help, Ryder calls Chase and asks that he will bring his winch to help with stabilizing the support beam until the train is off the bridge. While Chase soon arrives and lends his winch to lower a large log down to brace against the crippled support beam, Cali sees another chance for some food when the seagull returns with a loaf of bread to munch on. Cali scares the seagull off, but it returns and takes the bread with it, leaving Cali still hungry.

Meanwhile, the rock-slide is cleared and Ryder gives Katie the okay to let Mr. Hudson know he can start the train again. Katie agrees, but then mentions her worry for Cali.

As the train starts, Cali is unable to grip the roof, and is sent tumbling until she is grabbing the edge of the roof of the carriage for her dear life. As she meows in fear and fright, Ryder and the pups hear her, and Chase leaps into action. Using his canine agility to climb up the front of the locomotive and onto the roof, Chase soon finds Cali and helps her to safety. As Cali hugs Chase in gratitude, Chase lets off a sneeze due to his allergies, but endures it, especially when Cali is scared into his arms again by the train whistle/horn blowing. Cali is soon reunited with Katie, who thanks Chase for all his help, and despite nearly falling off the train himself due to another allergy-induced sneeze, Chase assures it was all in the line of duty.

Later, back at the Lookout, Katie rewards the pups with the treats from her grandmother, but Cali still attempts to sneak one herself due to still being hungry. In the end, Chase offers part of his that he didn't eat to Cali, and all is well, save for Chase knocking over the other pups with another sneeze due to his allergies.

As the pups and Cali play, the seagull reappears, now munching on a jelly doughnut. Cali attempts to climb up the slide to get it, but the slippery surface prevents her from doing so, and Chase soon joins her when trying to retrieve the soccer ball. In the end, the seagull shows it has a good heart, and tosses the doughnut to Cali, only for it to land on her head, and leave Chase on his back, laughing at Cali's misfortune as the story ends."

Later, Cap'n Turbot is lost at sea when a deep fog rolls in.",[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],['car'],[],"Pup Pup Boogie:

The story starts with Chase bumping into Ryder at the top of the Lookout and asking about the new Pup Pup Boogie 2 that was coming out today. Chase asks Skye if she's playing the all-new Pup Pup Boogie, but she says she's playing the old version. Chase joins the game, but gets all the steps wrong. He asks Skye how she does it, and Skye explains that when she starts a new move, she puts her front paw in front and puts her back paw on the side. Chase gives it a try, then he gets the hang of it. After they finish dancing, Skye and Chase are tired and out of breath. They go outside the Lookout to have a water break. Marshall and Rubble come running up to them to ask if the new Pup Pup Boogie has been delivered. Marshall does a tail spin, but ends up landing on Ryder. Ryder's pup-pad rings; it is Mayor Goodway. She panics and tells Ryder that a train carriage has derailed and if they don't hurry, the train which is bringing the all new Pup Pup Boogie game won't be able to enter the station. Ryder calls the PAW Patrol to the Lookout.

After Zuma's foul-up on the roundabout at the playground when he's trying to race Rocky, the pups all arrive in the elevator, yet Marshall attempts another tail spin, but ends up spinning out of the elevator and smacking into the entrance doors to the Lookout. He quickly recovers and gets back in the elevator just in time to head up to get their briefing.

Ryder tells the PAW Patrol what happened, but when he first loads up the briefing, he accidentally runs a playback of Chase and Skye's earlier Pup Pup Boogie replay, causing Marshall to dance a little bit. Marshall apologizes, but Ryder is impressed by how much he's practiced. Once Ryder gets the briefing up, Chase mentions that the new Pup Pup Boogie is coming on the next train, causing Marshall to go into another dance fit before he realizes his mistake and apologizes and ensures he's done dancing now. Ryder chooses Chase to come to pull the derailed carriage off the tracks, and for Rubble to remove the old rails and bring in new ones. Ryder slides down the fire pole to his ATV while Rubble and Chase go down the slide to their vehicles.

When they arrive at the train station, Ryder tells Chase to remove the carriage. Once that is done, Rubble checks the broken train tracks. He jumps, slips, and sprains his paw. With Rubble injured, Ryder attempts to call Mr. Hudson and warn him. Unfortunately, the running of the train is too noisy for Mr. Hudson to hear the ringing, and Mr. Hudson's elbow, along with the vibrating ring, knock the phone off the windowsill of the locomotive.

At Katie's Pet Parlor, Rubble's paw is bandaged, but with him under orders from Katie to stay off it and ice it, until it heals, Rubble suggests that Ryder drive his rig instead. Ryder can't do that, as he's too big, so Chase is chosen to drive it instead. However, Chase can't remember the instructions he is told by Ryder, and soon panics when he starts pressing controls in a frightened state. Once he calms down and mentions how it is like how he couldn't remember the steps in Pup Pup Boogie, Ryder has Chase turn on the radio to the Pup Pup Boogie music, and with its help, Chase soon gets the hang of it, and clears the wrecked rails and ties from the railroad crossing. Ryder handles the hard labor of laying down the new rails, and the track is fixed just in time. Mr. Hudson delivers the game, and everyone returns to the Lookout to watch Chase and Skye go at it in head-to-head competition. Marshall has another one of his wild tail spins, and crashes into Mayor Goodway. Marshall apologizes, and the story ends with Mayor Goodway laughing with Marshall as they rub heads while the Pup Pup Boogie is refrained one last time.

Pups in a Fog:

The pups are preparing for a sleep-out under the stars. Zuma is busy enjoying the bag of treats the pups have with them, while Marshall and Rubble play tug-of-war with one of the pillows. As for Chase, he is having a little trouble with his sleeping bag, as it keeps rolling back up from the free end that he doesn't have his weight on. It only gets worse when Rubble pups knocks into him when Marshall calls dibs on the final treat offers by Zuma, wrapping Chase up in his own sleeping bag, leaving him disappointed at the sleep-out being ruined for him, while the other pups laugh.

On the Lookout's balcony, Ryder watches the sunset, and the light from Cap'n Turbot's lighthouse on Seal Island come on. However, the light seems to be flickering and faltering. Concerned, Ryder checks through the Lookout's periscope, and watches as the light burns out completely. Worried, he calls Cap'n Turbot to let him know, but the Cap'n Turbot is currently out at sea on the Flounder when he gets Ryder's call. Worse, a heavy fog is rolling in, and without his lighthouse's beacon, Cap'n Turbot cannot even get home to Seal Island to replace it. To make things more problematic, Turbot knows that the MS Princess Maria cruise ship is due to head through Adventure Bay in an hour, and without the lighthouse, the ship could run aground on the rocks near Seal Island.

After the Captain has a moment of amnesia and forgets he had already called Ryder when he decides to call them and let them know, Turbot panics and gets himself stuck in a bucket. Ryder assures that the PAW Patrol are on their way, and Turbot walks away to continue his own business with a cheerful whistle.

As the pups are summoned to the Lookout, Chase is left to try and slither after them since he was still stuck in his sleeping bag, then hop after them into the elevator. Marshall gives the pups a good laugh after he sneezes up some feathers, and the pups are given their orders upon reaching the top: Ryder will head out with Zuma and Chase riding in Zuma's hovercraft to Seal Island and attempt to use Chase's light on his megaphone to substitute for the lighthouse's light until Cap'n Turbot can return to replace it, and prevent the Princess Maria from hitting the rocks. The other pups will need to try and stay awake in case Ryder needs backup.

While the pups do what they can to stay awake and not fall asleep, such as playing Marco Polo, Ryder, Chase, and Zuma find their way to Seal Island blocked by Wally the walrus. Despite their attempts to warn him that there is an emergency they need to get to, he only lets them pass once they give him a treat. When the PAW Patrol reach the lighthouse, the door is locked, and Cap'n Turbot has the keys with him personally back on the Flounder. Worse, the Princess Maria is now visible heading straight for Seal Island. With time running out, Ryder suggests having Chase fire his net under an open window for Ryder to use as a cargo net to climb up and into the lighthouse. Once inside, Ryder unlocks the door for Chase and Zuma, and they head for the top. When they get there, the Princess Maria's captain contacts them on the radio asking about the lighthouse's beacon. Ryder responds, and Chase gets his megaphone's light on just in the nick of time, allowing the captain and his crew to steer the Princess Maria clear of Seal Island. The captain sends his thanks and blows the ship's horn in gratitude, and Cap'n Turbot soon arrives home to replace the lighthouse beacon's bulb and thank Ryder for all his help.

Back at the Lookout, the other pups are about ready to doze off when Ryder, Chase, and Zuma return. Marshall speaks for all of them at how they stayed up in case Ryder needed them, and Skye can't wait to hear what happened. As Chase and Zuma let off tired yawns, Ryder goes to retrieve some sleep-out snacks for the pups to have as he tells them everything. When he returns, all the pups have fallen asleep, so he leaves the treats for them to have when they wake up. As the other pups sleep soundly, Ryder and Chase exchange a warm smile before dozing off themselves, Ryder wishing his pups goodnight as the camera pans upward to the star-filled sky."

The story starts with Marshall using the Lookout's periscope to look for a flock of geese, while below, Rubble and Rocky get the nest ready for the geese. Rocky having made the nest, while Rubble provides the fresh bread. Back in the Lookout, Ryder finally spots a flock for Marshall who, in his excitement, goes down the slide and crash-lands in the nest. He lets Rubble and Rocky know, and soon the geese arrive and take a liking to the nest and bread.

However, the youngest goose, a gosling with yellow feathers, wanders over into Skye's pup house, soon after, it gets a bucket on its head, leaving Marshall to help it out. The gosling takes a liking to Marshall, and Marshall names it ""Fuzzy"" in return. From that point on, Marshall and Fuzzy enjoy doing things together, good or bad with the outcome, until it is time for Fuzzy to go to sleep with his family. Fuzzy wants Marshall to sleep outside with him, and Fuzzy's mom agrees. However, during the night, Fuzzy wanders after a trail of bread crumbs, and disappears.

The next morning, Marshall and Fuzzy's family awaken to find him missing, and Marshall tells Ryder. Knowing that Fuzzy's flock have to leave soon to resume migrating, with or without him, Ryder summons the pups to help. Once he briefs them in the Lookout, and Marshall takes full responsibility for Fuzzy wandering off, Ryder passes out the orders: Chase and Marshall will help look for Fuzzy, while the rest of the pups remain at the Lookout on standby.

Once deployed, with no sign of Fuzzy upon calling him with a goose call through Chase's megaphone, they attempt to find him via one of his feathers. Chase picks up the scent, despite his allergies, and they head into town.

At the Train Station, Fuzzy looks for some food in the trash can, but a passerby offers a partially eaten piece of bread for Fuzzy. Although Fuzzy is grateful, two seagulls attempt to take it from him when he flies up to the roof of the train station. In the struggle, one of the seagulls leave a discarded plastic soda can ring from a six-pack of soda cans wrapped around Fuzzy's midsection, pinning his wings to the sides of his body. Despite that, Fuzzy attempts to take his bread back, but one of the seagulls refuses to let him.

Below, Ryder, Chase, and Marshall finally track Fuzzy to the station, and upon hearing and seeing him in trouble, Marshall goes to get his ladder, while the seagull that was fighting Fuzzy for the bread chases it to the ground. Chase arrests the seagull with his net, while the second seagull flees after knocking Fuzzy off-balance and having him on the verge of falling. Luckily, Marshall saves Fuzzy with his helmet, Ryder removes the plastic soda can ring so Fuzzy's wings are free, and they head back to the Lookout so Fuzzy can migrate with his family.

However, Fuzzy has developed such a bond with Marshall, he doesn't want to leave him. Ryder and Marshall both know that Fuzzy belongs with his family, so they have Marshall airlifted by Skye in her helicopter to help convince Fuzzy to fly and rejoin his family. It works, and Fuzzy rejoins his flock and leaves with them. Marshall is happy to see Fuzzy leave with his family, but also saddened that he might not see him again for a while.

Afterwards, as Marshall and the other pups celebrate another job well done with some jump-roping, Marshall is surprised to see Chickaletta joining him, and in his distraction, missteps and ends up tied up in the jump-rope. The story ends as everyone laughs at how birds really like Marshall.

Pup Pup and Away:

The story begins with Mayor Goodway questioning why she would agree to enter a hot air balloon race against mayors from other towns. She stands inside the basket of her balloon, covering her eyes and fears going at too high an altitude or velocity before Ryder reminds her that she is still on the ground. Mayor Goodway mentions conquering her fear of heights, and is consoled at the thought that Ryder will be there to help her fly the balloon during the race.

Getting the hot air balloon prepared, Ryder asks Chase and Rubble to unroll the envelope. After doing so, Chase spots a gaping hole in the balloon and informs everyone that it will not be able to fly. At this news, Mayor Goodway is resentful and loathes the likelihood of Mayor Humdinger of Foggy Bottom winning the annual race for another consecutive year. Ryder assures her that the balloon will be ready in time, and summons the PAW Patrol to the Lookout. The other pups, who were participating in a hurdles sprint race against each other (refereed by Rocky), begin a new race to the Lookout after being contacted. Chase, Rubble, Rocky, and Zuma all get wedged simultaneously between the elevator doors, with Skye joining them a moment afterward. Marshall soon arrives and knocks them all into the elevator before it ascends.

Up in the observatory, Ryder explains the situation to the pups and the significance of getting the hot air balloon ready to race. He calls on Rocky to find a fitting patch to cover the rip in the balloon, and Marshall to ensure that there are no gas leaks in the burner. With that, the PAW Patrol deploy and head to City Hall.

After arriving at City Hall, Ryder hurries the pups to get the hot air balloon prepared as quickly as possible since the race is about to begin. Rocky quickly examines the tear in the envelope and immediately goes to grab a patch from his recycling truck. In the meantime, Marshall sniffs around the gas tank and confirms that no leaks are present. Ryder tests the flame - which is in functional order - and Rocky glues a patch over the rip in the envelope. With everything in working condition, the balloon is inflated and Mayor Goodway is thrilled with their success.

Seeing other hot air balloons about to cross the starting line at Farmer Yumi's silo, Ryder turns off the flame and leaves to grab his flying gear. While Marshall and Rocky follow Ryder, Mayor Goodway enters the basket and psyches herself up for the race using positively reinforcing statements. However, while doing so, she accidentally ignites the flame and the hot air balloon begins to take off. Rocky and Marshall observe Mayor Goodway's balloon taking flight and attempt to grab onto a rope hanging from the basket (to weigh the balloon down). Marshall manages to bite onto the rope, but is carried upward with it. Ryder, now with his flight gear on, notices and runs after the balloon, catching Marshall when he loses his grip on the rope. Still rising, Mayor Goodway shouts frantically to Ryder for help.

Back at the Lookout, Skye and Chase use the periscope to watch the race, but realize that Adventure Bay's balloon is not among those of the other participants. Skye is then called by Ryder via her pup-tag and asked to help get him into the hot air balloon alongside Mayor Goodway.

In the air, Mayor Goodway builds up the courage to uncover her eyes. Just in time to avoid hitting Farmer Yumi's silo, she unties a sandbag from the hot air balloon (allowing it to rise over the structure). In the process, a chicken that was on top of the silo jumps into the basket. Mayor Goodway immediately adores the chicken and places it in her open purse. Not far ahead, the pilot of Mayor Humdinger's balloon points out that his lead is slight to Mayor Goodway. Mayor Humdinger expresses his surprise and commands his pilot to fly as fast as possible.

At the Lookout, Ryder secures a harness to himself and attaches it to Skye's helicopter using a cable. They take to the sky and Ryder shortly finds Adventure Bay's balloon as it heads toward Seal Island. In the hot air balloon, Mayor Goodway is still terrified, and continues to cower and cover her eyes despite seeing Ryder on the way. Skye catches up to the balloon and swings Ryder over to the basket on her second attempt, with Mayor Goodway helping him in. With Ryder now beside her, Mayor Goodway is eager for the flight, and Skye flies to the finish line, wishing the two luck. Ryder soon notices their balloon's impending collision with the lighthouse on Seal Island and increases the flame to ascend above it. Afterward, he and the mayor focus their attention on the race, though they are well behind the other participating balloons.

Meanwhile, Mayor Humdinger uses a telescope to observe his lagging competition, and begins to gloat of Foggy Bottom's upcoming victory. He is soon shocked and dumbfounded to realize that he is being passed by Mayor Goodway. Angered by the competitive taunts shouted by Mayor Goodway, Mayor Humdinger yells at his pilot to overtake the Adventure Bay balloon. Ryder and Mayor Goodway then spot Jake's mountain approaching (on the other side of which is the finish line), and Ryder suggests rising in the air to be pushed by stronger winds. Mayor Goodway agrees and is exhilarated at the thought of winning the race. Behind them, Mayor Humdinger is frantic to catch up to them.

As the two balloons approach the finish line, the pups (among other Adventure Bay citizens), stand cheering for Ryder and Mayor Goodway at the foot of the mountain. Mayor Goodway herself gets cocky just before being overtaken by Mayor Humdinger. Ryder states that they will have to drop quickly in order to win, and Mayor Goodway is supportive of the decision. In a close finish, the Adventure Bay balloon manages to break the finishing ribbon first, and lands in the designated spot. All of the spectators celebrate, and Mayor Humdinger contemptuously awards Ryder and Mayor Goodway with the race's trophy. Mayor Goodway passes the trophy to Ryder and the PAW Patrol for their significant involvement in the victory, and a barbecue is held at City Hall for the celebration.

At the barbecue, everyone is fed with burgers made by Mr. Porter, and Mayor Goodway thanks Ryder for his help. In the presence of Mayor Humdinger, Mayor Goodway also informs Ryder that she signed up for the Mayor's Submarine Race, and asks him to be her captain. Mayor Humdinger laughs and arrogantly states that Foggy Bottom will win the race as it had the previous year. The two mayors then comment back and forth about their predicted victories, while Ryder chuckles at the silliness of their rivalry."

Everyone thinks it's a ""snow monster"" and it's scaring the skiers away.",[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],['snow'],[],"Pups on Ice:

As the story begins, Marshall is attempting to do some jump-rope rhyming when he is interrupted as it starts to snow. When the pups ask Ryder if they can go snowboarding, especially Rubble, Ryder agrees, much to the pups' joy.

Up at Jake's Mountain, Jake is about to take Alex on his first snowboarding lesson, but Alex is too excited to listen, and ends up sliding down the hill in the wrong direction due to not following Jake's instructions. As Jake gives chase, Alex soon is transferred from his snowboard to the rescue sled and goes beyond the safety fence. Jake is able to catch up and stop them before they head over a steep cliff, but Alex, in his excitement over Jake's heroic act, jumps, and causes them to regain some forward momentum, sending Jake and Alex over the cliff, and trapping them on a ledge just underneath, unable to climb back up, or snowboard down as it is too dangerous. As Alex realizes his error and apologizes for screwing up, Jake decides to call Ryder to see if he is up for a little mountain rescue.

At the Lookout, Ryder is trying to catch snowflakes on his tongue, when he gets Jake's call. Once Jake shows where he and Alex are, Ryder assures him that they are on their way, and calls the pups. Marshall is unable to get his paws free of his snowboard, and flies into the elevator, crashing into the pups. After sheepishly apologizing, and seeing that he wasn't stuck anymore, Marshall and the others head up and learn of the situation from Ryder. Skye and Chase will join Ryder on the rescue mission, while the rest of the pups get their snowboarding gear together to meet them up on the slopes for some snowboarding after Jake and Alex are safe. With that, the PAW Patrol deploys, and heads to the summits.

Back with Jake and Alex, Jake offers some refreshment to Alex while they wait for the PAW Patrol. Soon, Jake hears Skye, but when she tries to get close enough to try and airlift Jake and Alex to safety, the wind from her helicopter causes several large icicles to come loose and nearly skewer Jake and Alex as they impale the ground around them. With Skye fearing she might cause an avalanche, Ryder has her back off and regroup with him and Chase. As they wonder what to do now, Ryder has an idea. Calling Jake, he asks if Jake can snowboard down himself after Ryder gets Alex to safety. Jake agrees, and using the cable from Skye's helicopter, in conjunction with Chase's winch cable, Ryder is able to rappel down to Jake and Alex, while Skye relays directions to him from her helicopter.

Soon, Ryder makes it down, and makes sure that Alex does just as he says so they make it back up safely. Alex, having learned his lesson, agrees, and while Jake waits for word that Alex is safe before he heads down, Ryder and Alex start to climb back up. Unfortunately, Chase's winch gets jammed between some rocks, so Ryder and Alex will have to climb up the rest of the way, hand-over-hand, themselves. However, a large patch of slippery ice prevents them from getting any further, until Chase offers his net as a cargo ladder to climb up and over it. Skye soon regroups with the others as Ryder and Alex are safe, and Jake calls to confirm the mission was successful. Ryder gives him the all-clear, and with a cry of ""Yee-Haw!"", Jake easily snowboards down to safety himself.

Back at Jake's cabin, he brings hot cocoa for Ryder and Alex, and Alex thanks Ryder for his help. Afterwards, Alex asks Jake for another chance to snowboard now that he has learned to listen before doing anything, and Jake gives Alex a second chance. Ryder even adds on to wait until the rest of the pups arrive, then they can snowboard together, much to Alex's delight.

Soon the rest of the pups arrive, and everyone enjoys the ski slopes, ending the story as Jake, Alex, Ryder, and the pups snowboard down the hill with a round of excited cheers.

Pups and the Snow Monster:

The story starts with the pups still enjoying the winter weather, with Rubble hoping they can still enjoy Adventure Bay Snow Day, especially up on Jake's Mountain.

Speaking of Jake's Mountain, the skiers and snowboarders are fleeing due to rumors of the legendary Adventure Bay Snow Monster having surfaced. Alex even took pictures of the monster tracks, and a video of him actually encountering the beast, which roars at Alex and sends him running for his life. Worrying for the safety of everyone, and as owner of the slopes, fearing he will have to close the mountain permanently, Jake calls Ryder for help.

At the Lookout, Ryder receives Jake's call, and as Jake worries about having to close the slopes indefinitely, Ryder assures him that the PAW Patrol will come up to investigate, and calls the pups. When they arrive, one look at Alex's video leaves all the pups spooked, but Ryder makes sure that they are still able to help. Ryder has Chase and Rubble join him on the mission as Chase can catch the monster in his net, and Rubble might need to do some bulldozing with the snow if needed. With that, the PAW Patrol deploys to the mountains.

Ryder converts his ATV to snowmobile mode, while Chase, after getting snowbound in his truck, follows Rubble as he clears a path with his rig. Once they reach Jake's office, they then set off to investigate the monster sightings. Chase rides with Ryder, while Rubble snowboards down. When they start to investigate, Rubble seems to be scared already, and a distant roar from the monster spooks all of them slightly, but they continue the search. Soon, the PAW Patrol find tracks, and a branch full of berries, indicating that the monster likes berries. Another, much closer roar sends Rubble and Chase leaping into Ryder's arms for safety, but he quickly gets the pups back on the case. Chase soon finds the scent of the monster to be very close by, and another roar, much closer than before, has Rubble cowering, that is, until he sees the monster's snout standing right next to Ryder, and warns him that he is right next to it. Chase acts quickly, but in his rush, he nets Ryder by accident before explaining that the monster was right next to him. Several more roars cause Ryder, Chase, and Rubble to get a good look at the monster, just like Alex had shown on his cellphone, and all three run for their lives.

When they get a better look at the monster, Ryder suddenly notices that the monster has a familiar tail that quickly recedes into its body, before it is revealed that the monster is actually Bettina, Garbie, and Chickaletta, stacked on top of each other. The footprints were caused by the boots that Bettina had gotten stuck on her feet, with Chickaletta adding in the smaller toe-like markings with her own feet. As Ryder prepares to bring the animals back to show Jake, a sneeze from Chase caused by his allergies from Chickaletta's feathers sends the animals fleeing, emitting the noise that sounded like the monster's roar. It was just a combination of Bettina's mooing, Garbie's bleating, and Chickaletta's clucking.

Back at Jake's cabin, Ryder reveals the truth to him, and soon Farmer Yumi and Mayor Goodway arrive to reprimand their animals for wandering off. With the mystery solved, Ryder reminds Mayor Goodway and Farmer Yumi to yelp for help if any of their animals wander off again and gives Jake the all-clear to reopen the slopes, and Rubble is ecstatic that Adventure Bay Snow Day is back on.

While Jake and Rubble enjoy the slopes and snowboard, the other pups work on a snowman, only for Marshall to lose control on the snow and crash into it, getting the snowman's head stuck over his own again. The story ends as the others laugh, and Marshall happily replies, albeit a bit muffled with a chuckle himself, ""I'm OK."""
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3141284/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,Ellie the baby elephant has escaped from the circus train. Mayor Goodway's purse chicken has gone missing.,[],TV-Y,Release date,['Jamie Whitney'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Pups Save the Circus:

The story beings with the pups and Ryder helping Raimundo, Eunice, and Ellie take down the big top and load it into the train. Once the equipment is packed up, Eunice and Ellie board their boxcar, Ryder gives Ellie some peanuts to eat, and the train sets off until the next time the circus comes to Adventure Bay.

Back at the Lookout, the pups are busy practicing their own circus acts, when Ryder receives a call from Alex, asking for help on a missing barrel of peanuts. Thinking a missing barrel of peanuts is not that much of an emergency, Ryder gets another call, this time from Raimundo. Unfortunately, Ellie had somehow escaped from the boxcar, and was heading back towards Adventure Bay. Eunice is very worried for her baby, and so is Raimundo, fearing for Eunice being so agitated over her missing daughter. Knowing that this is an emergency in need of the PAW Patrol, Ryder agrees to help, and calls the pups.

Marshall has his usual goof-up when he accidentally flings Rubble and Skye into the elevator due to them still stacked on each other when getting Ryder's call. Once in the tower, Ryder figures that since Ellie loves peanuts, they can use those to lure her back to Eunice and Raimundo. While Ryder and Chase go to see Alex, guessing the missing barrel of peanuts was Ellie's doing, Rocky heads around behind the Lookout to put together a device for luring her back to the circus train.

Chase and Ryder have little luck finding Ellie using the trail of eaten peanut shells from Mr. Porter's, but Rocky's arrival with his peanut dispenser will make finding Ellie much easier. That is, until Raimundo calls with more bad news. Before he can finish telling Ryder to look out for Eunice, the panic-stricken mother elephant is already stampeding down the street, looking for her baby. With two elephants missing from the circus, Ryder and Rocky go after Eunice, while Chase continues looking for Ellie.

Ryder and Rocky finally catch up to Eunice when she jams herself through one of the windows of Mayor Goodway's office at City Hall, sniffing the Mayor with her trunk to see if Ellie had been there. Using a handful of peanuts to get Eunice's attention, Ryder is able to lure her into following Rocky and his peanut dispenser all the way to Farmer Yumi's. Yumi and Raimundo are waiting to corral her in the barn, but Eunice is spooked by Bettina, forcing Ryder to mount Eunice and calm her down enough to guide her into the barn and finally rein her in. With Eunice safe for the time being, Ryder and Rocky head back into town to see if Chase has found Ellie yet.

When they return to Mr. Porter's, the PAW Patrol discover a broken ladder with the peanut shells, and find Ellie now on the roof, looking like she is ready to perform her circus act and jump off. Ryder is frantic, with Ellie ready to jump any second and be seriously hurt, he suddenly realizes the air mattress the pups were using earlier can be used as an air cushion for Ellie. Rocky has brought it in his truck, and Mr. Porter exhausts himself inflating it, while Ryder uses Chase's megaphone to stall Ellie by making her think he is announcing her act. With the mattress inflated and ready, Ryder gives Ellie her cue, and the baby elephant performs her jump and emerges unharmed, just as Raimundo and Eunice arrive, allowing mother and baby elephant to be reunited at last.

Back at the train platform, Raimundo thanks Ryder and the PAW Patrol for everything, and gives Ryder his ringmaster's hat as thanks as he and the elephants take off, this time, heading home to the circus' home base after such an exciting day in Adventure Bay.

Pup a Doodle Do:

The story starts off with Marshall and Skye playing Pup Pup Boogie 2 at the Lookout. Just then, Chickaletta arrives and starts playing the game as well. Mayor Goodway arrives to collect Chickaletta and tells the pups that they will be on the show Hello Adventure Bay.

Outside City Hall, Mayor Goodway is being taped. She turns her back to clean the statue of her Great Grandpa Grover Goodway when Chickaletta hops out of her purse and wanders off. Mayor Goodway gets worried and calls the PAW Patrol. Ryder deploys Chase and Marshall to search for the chicken, following Marshall pulling the pups into the elevator in another out-of-control tailspin before responding to Ryder's summon.

Ryder, Chase, and Marshall arrive at the city hall. Chase sniffs the purse and follows the scent all the while being followed by the camera crew of Hello Adventure Bay. Chase follows Chickaletta's scent to the lemonade shop where Chickaletta is on top of the milkshake straw statue eating a slice of pizza a seagull dropped there. Marshall ascends his firetruck ladder to reach Chickaletta, but she notices a bread truck drive by and flies onto it, being carried away by it, forcing Mayor Goodway, the cameraman, Ryder, and the PAW Patrol to pursue it.

The PAW Patrol and the camera crew follow the bread truck to Farmer Yumi's farm. Chickaletta has jumped in a pen full of other chickens, making her hard to find. There, Marshall and Chase tried unorthodox methods by making chicken sounds or asking a chicken who lives in a purse to step forward. Then Mayor Goodway arrives and fills in the biggest detail by telling them that Chickaletta wears an ankle bracelet, but anxiously opens the gate. Ryder warns her not to, but unfortunately too late, as all the chickens rush past Mayor Goodway as they exit the pen. They spot Chickaletta's ankle bracelet, but she takes off again riding on the back of Bettina, who's spooked by Mayor Goodway's shouts and Chickaletta riding on her back. Ryder and the crew go after Chickaletta while Chase and Marshall stay behind to round up the runaway chickens.

Chickaletta and Bettina arrive at the suspension bridge where Chickaletta flies up to the top to join some seagulls, making them confused. Mayor Goodway and Ryder arrive at the bridge and spot Chickaletta, at which point, Mayor Goodway attempts to call Chickaletta down to her by standing on the rail which worries Ryder. Mayor Goodway starts to lose her balance and begins to fall. Luckily, Chase grabs her with his net, but Chickaletta slowly descends down to the water where she can't swim. Ryder calls Zuma to head to the bridge.

Zuma in his hovercraft zooms to the bridge and launches his buoy where Chickaletta lands on it safely. Ryder recovers her, and back on the beach, Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta are reunited. Mayor Goodway apologizes for ruining the show, but the Hello Adventure Bay cameraman says this will be a great show having caught the entire operation.

At the end, the pups watch themselves on Hello Adventure Bay where Marshall asks Ryder why can't all their adventures be on TV. Ryder breaks the fourth wall by saying ""You never know, Marshall."" and looking at the camera as the story ends."

The story begins with the pups having some fun, while Ryder is working on his ATV. At Mr. Porter's cafe, Alex shows off his new super-trike to his grandfather. Mr. Porter is impressed by the huge use of duct tape his grandson used, along with the pizza paddles for brakes. However, when Alex attempts to break it in, it jumps the curb, and fall to pieces on impact with the sidewalk again. Alex is devastated, and his grandfather prevents him from trying to recover the pieces while they're in the street, fearing for his grandson's life. As Alex mourns the destruction of his super-trike, Mr. Porter decides to call Ryder for help.

At the Lookout, Ryder gets Mr. Porter's call. Mr. Porter knows about Ryder's handiwork with technology and asks that he lend Alex a hand repairing his super-trike. Ryder agrees and summons the pups. Once in the Lookout, Rocky is impressed by Alex's use of recycled parts, and is asked to help recover the parts so that they can repair the super-trike, maybe even make some improvements to it. Chase is tasked with securing the street so they can recover the pieces without traffic interfering. With that, the PAW Patrol deploy, arrive at Mr. Porter's, Chase secures the street, and Rocky starts the cleanup effort.

Later, back at the Lookout, Ryder is hard at work with Rocky's help in putting Alex's super-trike back together, replacing the pizza paddles used as brakes with bike pedals. Alex practices running around with his steering wheel, and nearly knocks over the recycle bin. Chase intervenes, and Alex apologizes. Once the final piece is put on Alex's super-trike, a bell to signal people, Alex is given his helmet and is ready to go.

Ryder suggests that Alex take it nice and slow, but Alex, in his excitement, pedals away faster than he should, forcing Ryder, Rocky, and Chase to give pursuit. Alex is soon so excited, he unintentionally takes his feet off the pedals. Without his feet to control them, the pedals accelerate on their own, and Alex soon finds himself speeding faster and faster down the Lookout's driveway towards the bridge, helpless to slow or stop himself. Excitement changes to fear as Alex is now scared for his life. Ryder catches up on his ATV and tries to help, but as Alex is too scared to attempt to regain control, a car is heading up the street towards the Lookout's driveway at the same time. Ryder has Chase speed ahead to roadblock the street with his truck, while he calls Skye back at the Lookout to lend him a hand with her helicopter in stopping Alex. With Skye's help, Alex is finally stopped, but it is clear he knows he messed up big time. Only when Ryder talks to him in a stern tone does Alex know he should have taken it slow and steady first, before going faster. He apologizes and thanks the pups for all their help, but when Ryder suggests heading over to get some lemonade, Alex is quick to want to speed on over quickly. Only when he gets stern looks from Skye, Rocky, and Chase does Alex realize his error in forgetting the lesson he just learned and agrees to head on over at a more favorable speed.

Once there, Alex is awarded a trophy that doubles as an ice cream sundae cup, much to his joy as the pups and Ryder all laugh to end the story.

Pups Fight Fire:

Marshall is going to try to break the World's Fastest Fire-Pup record, which currently stands at 10 minutes. The course is made-up of an obstacle course, rescuing a stuffed cat in a tree, putting out a fake fire, and ringing the City Hall bell. But during the practice run with rescuing Cali, Marshall breaks his ladder. Now he loses confidence in himself that his clumsiness will get in the way of his performance. Ryder realizes that Marshall needs encouragement and help to fix his ladder. Calling the pups to the Lookout, Ryder reveals that Marshall is their emergency this time.

Rocky is to help find something to help repair the broken rungs on Marshall's ladder, while Marshall just has to stay focused on the competition and ignore anything else. With a catchphrase of ""Do my best, and forget the rest"", Marshall accepts, and they head down to begin repairs to Marshall's fire truck.

Rocky finds a broom they can cut into pieces to use as new rungs to repair the ladder, and they soon have it fixed, just as Mayor Goodway calls asking about Marshall. With the ladder fixed, and Marshall panting excitedly, Ryder tells Mayor Goodway that they are on their way, then contacts Chase for a police escort for Marshall. Chase races ahead to block the intersection to let Marshall through, and soon the citizens, including Mr. Porter and Alex, head off to watch Marshall, cheering him on. At the starting line, the Hello Adventure Bay cameraman is waiting for Marshall, and Mayor Goodway is growing nervous and worried. Luckily, Marshall makes it, and the competition goes live. While Marshall repeats his catchphrase, Mayor Goodway reveals that if Marshall can complete the course in 10 minutes and ring the City Hall bell in time, he'll be the fastest fire-pup ever.

Marshall makes good time with the first parts of the competition, save for getting his foot caught in the tires and saying his trusty ""I'm good!"" catchphrase to the camera, but when he reaches the beach and puts out the fire for the competition, things go bad.

As Marshall hurries to finish the course and ring the bell, the cameraman accidentally knocks over a stage light, causing it to short out, and a spark from it ignites the lifeguard's chair. As Mayor Goodway and the cameraman evacuate, Marshall's firefighting instincts take over, and he puts the fire out before it can spread. Mayor Goodway is grateful, but Marshall fears it has cost him the competition. Ryder says he still has 30 seconds left, and with the pups and citizens cheering him on, Marshall goes for it.

Marshall reaches City Hall and uses his ladder to reach the bell quickly, but when he asks how he did, Mayor Goodway sadly announces that Marshall lost by one minute. Despite Marshall failing to win the competition, Mayor Goodway still awards him the trophy for being the Greatest Fire Pup in the World due to his heroism with sacrificing the competition to put out a real fire. Marshall is speechless, and is allowed a chance to circle the area in front of City Hall as everyone cheers for him, soon revealing to be playback of the competition on the Lookout TV, while Marshall beams with his new trophy.

Soon after, Rubble announces the upcoming competition for Fastest Construction Pup, and as he and the other pups race off, Marshall trips following after them, ending the story with Marshall's regular catchphrase: ""I'm good!"""

Unfortunately, the doors are frozen shut from the cold, and his attempts to open them lead to the van sliding downhill and landing on the ice that has frozen over the shore area of the bay. Worse, the ice is too thin, and begins to give way, submerging the front bumper of the van into the bay. Mr. Porter and Alex are horrified. If the van goes down, the pups' food and treats will be lost. They immediately call Ryder to let him know.

Ryder is busy playing video-games on his pup-pad when he gets the call. Once he does, Ryder checks the situation out via the periscope, then calls the pups. Rubble is having fun with the other pups, when his stomach rumbles, indicating his starvation for Mr. Porter's food, before the pups get Ryder's summon. Once the pups are topside, Ryder shows them the situation, and they are just as horrified as the Porters. Even Rubble has to excuse another rumble from his stomach, saying that it is just worried for the van. Knowing they have to get the van secured and tow it back onto dry land, Ryder selects Chase and Zuma to help with the rescue, and they quickly deploy down to meet up with the Porters. Alex repeats the situation to Ryder in panic before Ryder reminds him of why the PAW Patrol is there, much to Alex's embarrassment, and Mr. Porter is left unsure as to how Ryder can help. Ryder reveals he can hook the winch from Chase's truck onto his ATV, convert it to hovercraft mode, drive it out to the van, hook the winch on, and then Chase can reel it in.

Everything works fine at first, but as soon as Ryder secures the winch, the ice begins to crack and break up. Ryder tries to get back to his ATV quickly, but the separating ice causes his ATV to drift away, out of reach. Knowing he can't risk jumping without a chance of getting hypothermia, Ryder has Zuma shoot him his buoy as an anchor so Zuma can pull Ryder back to his ATV, allowing Ryder to get some ice surfing in. Just as Ryder's ice floe finally breaks in two, Ryder is able to somersault off, and land perfectly back in the seat of his ATV. He and Zuma return to shore, where Alex is relieved to see Ryder is OK, and Chase hauls Mr. Porter's van back to safety. After Mr. Porter has another close call losing his lucky hat, the PAW Patrol return to the Lookout so the pups can eat and get their treats.

Once the pups are all fed, Rubble offers another rumble from his stomach as a thank you to Mr. Porter and Alex, leaving them and Ryder to laugh as the other pups play in the snow to end the story.

Pups Get a Lift:

The story begins with Rocky and Rubble helping unload produce from Mr. Porter's van. As they wonder what Mr. Porter is cooking up for them, Rocky discovers some rotten bananas in one of the crates. While Rubble is disgusted at seeing them, Rocky tosses them into the recycle bin, knowing that rotten fruit makes great compost. Rubble retrieves the last crate, but puts it down lopsided, causing it to spill its contents of oranges all over the sidewalk. Unfortunately, Mr. Porter comes out of his cafe at that point to give Rubble and Rocky fresh-cooked meatballs for their hard work and slips on one of the oranges. The meatballs go flying, but while Mr. Porter catches one on the plate, the other plops down on his head, much to Rubble and Rocky's amusement.

At the Lookout, Chase and Ryder are practicing kicking the soccer ball against the garage door when Ryder gets a call from Jake up at the ski slopes. There's a problem with the chairlift up at the mountain as it has broken down. Jake has managed to evacuate everyone off but Katie and Cali, who are stranded. Cali lets off a mournful meow, causing Chase to recoil and whine at seeing Cali stuck like that. Ryder gives Chase a good scratch to cheer him up, and then asks if Katie is alright. Katie assures she's fine, but Cali is getting cold. Jake asks if the PAW Patrol can help out, and as Ryder says the PAW Patrol motto, Chase smiles proudly, and Ryder summons the pups.

At Mr. Porter's, Rubble and Rocky get the call and set off, but not before Rubble returns to pick up the pups' meatballs as a treat from Mr. Porter. As for Mr. Porter, he slips on another orange and ends up stuck in the recycle bin, making a fruit joke about it.

At the Lookout, Rubble is second-to-last to enter the elevator, but drops the bag containing the pups' meatballs. When he attempts to retrieve it, in runs Marshall with a howl, crashing into Rubble, and sending the bag flying, spilling the meatballs down towards the pups. One by one, they each catch a meatball in their mouth, and Marshall decides this is the most delicious wipe-out he's ever had, earning laughs from everyone. Once topside, Ryder tells the pups of the situation on Jake's Mountain. However, Rubble seems the most interested due to his love of snowboarding, and hopes that Ryder will pick him for the mission. To Rubble's disappointment, Ryder chooses Rocky and Marshall for the rescue, and sets off without him.

At Jake's Mountain, Marshall can't get his firetruck down to help Katie and Cali as the slope is too steep. Deciding now is when they need Rubble's help, Ryder calls back to the Lookout. Meanwhile, Rubble is busy voicing his disappointment to Chase and Skye, while Zuma takes a nap, when Ryder's call comes in. Rubble first thinks that Ryder needs Skye and her helicopter, but once he realizes that Ryder asked for his help, his spirits are lifted so much, Rubble accidentally minces up his catchphrase before recovering and is happy he is going to Jake's Mountain. The other pups cheer for Rubble as he deploys and heads for the ski slopes.

Back at the chairlift, Rocky finds the cause of the breakdown, one of the wheels that the cable runs across has come loose and fallen off. Jake is impressed, but reminds them that they need to first get everyone off, then they can start repairs.

At Jake's cabin, Rubble finally arrives, and Marshall escorts him to where he is needed. However, Marshall lands on a spare snowboard, is sent flying, and has to try and steer through the obstacle course of speed bumps on the slope. He can't and is soon dismounted, wrapped up in a snowball, and left rolling down the slope until he crashes into one of the support poles for the chairlift. Marshall is uninjured, but Katie and Cali are starting to shiver as they start to succumb to hypothermia and frostbite from the cold. Rubble soon arrives on his own snowboard to check on Marshall, and they are soon joined by Ryder on his. Ryder then suggests making a snow staircase to help Katie and Cali down. Rubble is quick to get right to work, and within a short while, a nice stack of snow blocks have been stacked up to the chair where Katie and Cali are. Ryder offers to help them down, and while Katie is very grateful and hops down to join Ryder, Cali takes another look at the long way down from the chair, and panics, jumping onto Katie's helmet, then trying to grab hold of the chair again. Her grip slips, and she bounces down the snow stairs, right towards Marshall. Ryder gives Marshall the heads-up, and despite Marshall attempting to catch Cali, she crashes into him, and sends both of them rolling down the slope in another snowball, crashing into the chairlift support once more. As Katie and Ryder run down to check on them, Cali hops happily into Katie's arms, showing she's alright, while Marshall admits that he's fine too, but he's not much of a snow pup, earning laughs from the kids.

Later, Rocky is repairing the wheel to the chairlift from Marshall's ladder and restoring it to full operational mode while Katie thanks Ryder and the pups for coming to her and Cali's aid. Ryder is grateful that Katie yelped for help, earning a happy purr and cheers of agreement from Cali, Marshall, and Rubble, respectively. Soon, Rocky has finished repairs, and Jake asks who wants to try out the chairlift now that it's fixed. Rubble is first to volunteer out of pure joy at being able to snowboard, and Ryder is more than willing to give Rubble his wish, saying that they are all good pups, earning additional cheers from Marshall and Cali. With that, Rubble takes off, and soon everyone is snowboarding down the slopes. At one point, Rubble and Ryder launch off a jump, performing perfect flips in the air before landing. Marshall and Cali try the same thing, but can't stabilize their boards for landing, leading to them each being encased in another snowball and rolling down into the chairlift support pole again. When they emerge, the snow on their heads makes Cali look like Skye, and Marshall like Chase, leading to laughter from them, and the others, as the story ends."

Ryder helps Skye with her costume, Chase works the decorations, and Rocky and Rubble work on a very large jack o' lantern.

Meanwhile, over at the dock near the beach, Cap'n Turbot is preparing to take Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, Katie, Cali, Mr. Porter, and Alex on a haunted ghost ship ride. Cali however, is angry at how Chickaletta is wearing the same costume as her, but Chickaletta is not bothered by it. The other costumes have Cap'n Turbot wearing a squid on his head, Katie as a witch, Mayor Goodway dressed as a ladybug, Alex as a frog, and Mr. Porter as a clown.

At the Lookout, the pups are scared by Marshall as he appears in his pumpkin-themed costume for going trick-or-treating. Each of the pups are dressed up differently: Rocky as a Viking, Skye as a princess, Chase as a superhero, Zuma as a pirate, and Rubble as Elvis. Ryder is dressed up as a knight so he can go trick-or-treating with the pups as well.

Back at the dock, trouble is brewing on the ghost ship. Wally keeps snatching the Halloween cookies Mr. Porter baked up right out from under Mr. Porter and Mayor Goodway's noses and devouring them when they aren't looking, and Cali raises the sails by accident chasing a seagull. Soon the ship has set sailed, and Cap'n Turbot loses his glasses attempting to swim after it to catch up. Chickaletta unknowingly keeps steering the ship as she jumps back and forth on the ship's wheel due to being amused by it turning back and forth on its own, which also causes the ship to sway as well. Mayor Goodway does her best to maintain confidence and no belief in ghosts, but a mysterious groaning has her freaking out anyhow. Mr. Porter decides the only option left is to call the PAW Patrol, and phones Ryder as the pups are continuing their trick-or-treating.

When Ryder gets the mayday call, he calls the pups to the Lookout, where Marshall crashes into the other pups like bowling pins. Marshall tries to make light of what happened with a couple of jokes, but none of the pups laugh, forcing Marshall to flat out tell them that they should just get topside and get their orders before the pups chew him out for his puns. That decision the pups don't argue with and are all smiles afterwards as they head up. When they're suited up, everyone, except for Skye, are still wearing the headgear for their costumes. Skye had to switch her princess hat for her pilot's cap and goggles.

When they arrive, Ryder passes out the following orders: Marshall will be airlifted by Skye to the ship to lower the sails, while Zuma joins Ryder with catching up on the water. The team deploys, and despite him still wearing his costume, Ryder is still able to deploy his life jacket underneath his armor before he and Zuma hit the water, without causing any damage to either his costume or his life jacket.

When they catch up to the ship, Skye is able to get Marshall into the crow's nest, allowing him to lower the rear sail, but there's still the matter of the ship's rocking caused by Chickaletta working the ship's wheel. Ryder manages to grab hold of the ladder after setting his ATV on auto-pilot, but Zuma is unable to jump the distance from his hovercraft to grab Ryder's hand and falls into the water. He manages to recover via his Pup Pack and rejoin Ryder to resume climbing aboard. Once Ryder, Marshall, and Zuma are aboard the ship, it is not long before they find the sources for the ship being so-called ""haunted"":

They find Chickaletta manning the ship's wheel and recover her, ending the ship's swaying.

The eerie groans coming from behind some barrels is actually Wally the Walrus, having dozed off after pigging out on Mr. Porter's Halloween cookies.

When one of the sails is raised again by Cali's attempts to catch a seagull once more, she's caught red-handed this time, much to Katie's bemusement.

As for Cap'n Turbot's missing glasses, Ryder soon points out that they're in his back pocket. With the mysteries solved, the ship is brought back to the beach and properly moored so it doesn't take off again. However, before everyone can enjoy the party, more eerie moaning convinces everyone to abandon ship and refuse to go back aboard, faking seasickness to get the pets and Alex off. Luckily, Ryder convinces everyone to return to the Lookout to have their party there instead.

Back at the Lookout, everyone enjoys themselves. Ryder gives the pups some of the cookies that Wally did not eat, Alex plays Pin the Tail with Katie and the adults, and Rocky and Zuma spook Skye as she asks about where her prince is. Everyone is enjoying themselves until Rocky sees something and howls at the moon, leading to the rest of the pups doing the same, as they notice a ghost version of the ship floating through the sky. Everyone is amazed, if not a little spooked, and are truly in awe over the excitement they've all had for Halloween, be it either trick-or-treating, solving a mystery on a ghost ship, or even seeing a real ghost ship as it floats across the night sky in front of the full moon."

With the aid of Marshall's ladder, they're able to decorate the upper parts of the tree as they sing their own version of ""Deck the Halls"" while they do so. Skye adds the star on top via her pup-pack. Afterwards, the pups retire to bed.

That night, a storm looks to be blowing in as the pups are tracking Santa via radar, but upon seeing the storm, grow worried, but Ryder is confident Santa will make it through the storm no problem. The pups are excited and want to stay up to see Santa, but Ryder doubts they can. He's soon proven right when most of them fall asleep, and soon, Marshall joins them.

Outside, Santa is struggling through the storm, when he brushes against the tree tops and loses his presents, nicks the roof of Farmer Yumi's barn, causing him to lose the Christmas star that keeps his sleigh and reindeer airborne, and soon crashes into the snow, where the reindeer run off in fright, much to his frustration and sadness.

Back at the Lookout, Ryder is watching the radar, when Santa's beacon is lost in the blizzard. His pup-pad soon rings, and as he wonders who it could be, it is revealed to be Santa himself, asking for Ryder's help. Without the presents, the Christmas star, or the reindeer, Christmas will have to be canceled since Santa will be unable to complete his trip. Ryder is horrified, but when Santa reminds him of the PAW Patrol motto of ""No job is too big, no pup is too small,"" Ryder is ready to help and summons the pups.

Once topside, the pups are still sleepy, but are soon fully awake when Ryder warns them of how severe the situation is. Once Ryder tells them of the situation with Santa, they are just as worried and horrified about what's happened to Santa, and Ryder makes it clear that he needs all the pups for helping save Santa and Christmas. The PAW Patrol deploys, and soon splits up: Ryder, Rocky, and Rubble find the remains of the sleigh, and set to work mending the broken runner, while Skye finds one of the lost bags of presents, which is soon retrieved by Marshall and Chase. Thought while Chase catches the presents with his net, Marshall is left to fall and land in the snow.

Soon, Skye, Marshall, Chase, and Zuma return with all the gifts, and while repairs on the sleigh continue, Skye, Marshall, and Zuma will take care of delivering the gifts to Adventure Bay's residents, while Chase sets about hunting down and rounding up the reindeer. He soon finds Prancer, and herds him back to the sleigh, then goes for the rest.

With the presents, Skye delivers to Katie and Cali at the Pet Parlor, Marshall does Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta at City Hall, and Zuma is interrupted delivering to Cap'n Turbot on Seal Island by Wally, who only wanted his Christmas present himself, which Zuma gladly delivers to him.

The sleigh is soon repaired, but when Ryder calls Santa, he's still looking for the Christmas star. Checking the radar, they find the star landed at Farmer Yumi's. When the PAW Patrol arrive, they find that the star landed on Bettina, causing her to fly like a reindeer. Luring her back to the ground with some hay, Rocky retrieves the star, and Ryder lets Santa know the mission is accomplished. Meanwhile, Chase is still having trouble rounding up the reindeer, but the aid of his megaphone finally gets them to cooperate.

Once back at the sleigh, Santa returns the star to its spot on the front of the sleigh, and the magic is restored. The pups soon climb aboard, and while amazed at being in Santa's sleigh, when they tell the reindeer ""Dash away all,"" the reindeer take the pups on a ride through the sky, before Santa whistles for the reindeer to return to Earth, as he needs to get a move on as he's behind schedule as it is. With a final cry of ""Merry Christmas, PAW Patrol! And thank you!"", Santa departs to resume his journey.

Back at the Lookout, Rubble is worried at how Santa has not left them any presents, but the other pups assure him that helping save Christmas for the whole world was the greatest Christmas ever, presents or no presents. Ryder soon reminds the pups they need to get to bed for Christmas morning, and the PAW Patrol retires to the Lookout for the night.

Christmas morning, the PAW Patrol awakens to find that Santa returned on his way home and left them presents under the tree for them as thanks for helping him out. The pups are excited to open their gifts, but Skye tells them that Ryder gets the first one, and they all agree. The gift Ryder gets from the pups is a large bone, and while he is grateful to the pups for the gift, he returns the generosity by letting the pups have the bone instead, ending the story as the pups and Ryder enjoy Christmas morning, and the knowledge of how they helped save Christmas for the entire world as well with helping out Santa Claus."

Some of the steps at City Hall are broken. Luckily, Rubble fixes the steps on the double. Mayor Goodway is so impressed with him, she asks Ryder how he found Rubble. Ryder said that Rubble was found in a tree. Mayor Goodway wants to know the story since she finds it strange to find a puppy in a tree.

As Ryder tells Mayor Goodway the story, a flashback story is shown on how the PAW Patrol met and rescued Rubble from a tree, and how he joined the PAW Patrol. The flashback starts with Marshall, Ryder, and Chase playing soccer in the yard until Marshall misses the ball and hits a very young Rubble, who is so amazed to see a ball that he plays with it, but the ball bounces into a tree. With great bravery, Rubble goes and gets the ball, but gets stuck in the tree and becomes very scared.

Marshall sees Rubble and calls for help. Ryder and Chase hear Marshall's howls and arrive quickly, Chase wearing his pup-pack and uniform. When Ryder is unable to reach Rubble due to the ledge being too narrow, Chase uses his net to help Rubble climb to safety. Rubble admits to not being scared, then is offered something to eat by Ryder. As the other pups watch Rubble eat, he reveals he's been on his own for a while. He apparently hasn't eaten very much since the PAW Patrol found him, as he scarfs down the food like crazy.

As Rubble talks to the other pups about his past, Ryder gets a call from Jake, who has been trapped in some snow boulders up on the mountain and needs help. Ryder calls the pups, and as they head to the elevator, Marshall explains about the PAW Patrol to Rubble, along with his own skills as the PAW Patrol's firefighting pup, before he and Rubble crash into the elevator. As the pups are suited up, Rubble is amazed by what he sees, and is even more amazed upon reaching the top and seeing the inside of the Lookout.

As Ryder chooses Skye and Chase to assist with helping Jake, and they deploy, Rubble slides down the slide behind the others, and lands in the back of Chase's police truck. It is not long before Chase notices his passenger, tells Ryder, and has Rubble buckle up.

When they reach the mountain, Skye provides over watch, while Chase and Ryder try to figure out how to get down to Jake. During as they plan, Rubble spots a snowboarder, and wants to do it himself. Finding a spare snowboard and helmet, he's soon heading down to help Jake, after Ryder is rappelled down by Chase and his winch. Skye spots Rubble and tells Ryder, and when Rubble arrives, it doesn't take him long to dig right through the snow and reach Jake. Ryder is worried when Rubble disappears and asks Jake. When Jake reveals Rubble inside with him, and Ryder finds where Rubble dug a way out, he's impressed. Once Jake is rescued, he wonders if Rubble is the newest member of the PAW Patrol. This gives Ryder an idea.

Back at the Lookout, Ryder reveals he's found a home for Rubble. The other pups are sorry to see him go, until Ryder reveals Rubble's new home is with the PAW Patrol, much to Rubble's and the other pups' joy.

A little while later, Rubble is sworn in as the PAW Patrol's new Construction Pup, given his pup-tag and construction hardhat, and rides the slide down into his brand new digger/pup house. As the rest of the PAW Patrol join him, Ryder says Rubble has some growing to do before he can reach the controls, but once he does, Rubble will be a valued teammate to the PAW Patrol.

With that, the flashback ends, and Ryder sums it up as since that day, Rubble has been a good pup ever since. Rubble corrects him saying he's a great pup, and the story ends with Mayor Goodway agreeing with Rubble as he gets another scratching from Ryder.

Pups Save a Walrus:

The story begins with the PAW Patrol helping clean up the beach following a storm that knocked over all the recycle bins. Mayor Goodway offers a bone to the pup who does the best with cleaning up the beach. All the while, the local crab is having its peace disturbed by how the trash it is using is being cleaned up. After preventing Marshall and Chase from cleaning up one pile of recyclables, and snapping at them as well, the crab departs.

Out in the bay, Cap'n Turbot is also cleaning up the litter that is floating in the bay, when Wally appears to offer his help. After giving Wally a clam as thanks, Turbot is okay with offering Wally more for doing some tricks. After Wally performs his patented Wally Spinner for another clam, he then takes a deep breath and goes underwater. Cap'n Turbot is impressed, but when Wally doesn't resurface after a minute or so, Cap'n Turbot becomes worried. When he looks underwater, Cap'n Turbot spots Wally trapped below by an old fishing net. Knowing that Wally won't be able to hold his breath for much longer before he is forced to exhale, and risk drowning, Cap'n Turbot decides to call the pups.

Ryder is busy with loading the full recycle bins into Rocky's truck, when he gets Cap'n Turbot's call for help. Seeing the concern on Cap'n Turbot's face for Wally's well-being, Ryder agrees to help, mounts his ATV, and summons the pups. Marshall ends up getting a megaphone from the lifeguard chair stuck on his head, leading to him crashing into the other pups upon reaching the elevator, but at least the crash gets the megaphone unstuck from Marshall's head.

Once the pups reach topside, Ryder gives them the heads-up on Wally, replaying Cap'n Turbot's advice on how walruses can hold their breath for a very long time, but not forever. Knowing that they have to help Wally before he runs out of oxygen, Ryder deploys Zuma to help him with checking on Wally, while Chase will go to the beach and standby with his winch in case they need to tow Wally to shore. With that, the PAW Patrol deploys, and while Chase arrives on the beach across from the Flounder, Ryder and Zuma meet up with Cap'n Turbot. Ryder gears up in his scuba gear, and together with Zuma, head down to check on Wally.

When they reach him, Wally is already on the verge of being forced to exhale. While Zuma offers his oxygen tank to give Wally fresh air, Ryder spots the net entangling Wally being wrapped around an old, rusty anchor. As Ryder removes the net from the anchor and heads back up to Wally and Zuma, he has to hesitate when the baby whale and a school of fish swim past, Wally signaling the baby whale so it can avoid everyone. When Ryder regroups with Zuma, he is now on the verge of having to exhale, but is able to still talk while Wally is using his breather. Once Ryder hooks a cable from Zuma's pup-pack to the net and signals Zuma, Zuma recalls his breather so he can get fresh air into his lungs, and together, Ryder and Zuma carry Wally back to the surface.

Back topside, Cap'n Turbot is worrying for Wally, but when Ryder and Zuma resurface with Wally safe, Cap'n Turbot is relieved, but with the net too tightly wrapped around Wally to loosen there, they need to get Wally to shore. Zuma heads over to tell Chase that they need his winch, and after Chase throws it out for Zuma to catch, Zuma brings it back to Ryder. Wally nearly goes under again when Ryder takes the winch from Zuma, but Ryder quickly dives to retrieve Wally, hook up the winch, and then signal Chase to bring Wally to shore.

Cap'n Turbot soon arrives on shore in his dinghy, and is happily reunited with Wally, now untangled from the net. He thanks the PAW Patrol for saving Wally's life, and Ryder, Zuma, and Chase head back to the beach to see how the other pups are doing. The other pups have finished the cleanup, with 16 recycle bins to show for their effort, but when Mayor Goodway offers the bone, Ryder mentions that the pups have all been great, so he and the Mayor work out a compromise: Marshall gets the bone, but when the other pups whimper, they get bone-shaped treats as the compromise.

The story ends with Wally, Cap'n Turbot, Ryder, Mayor Goodway, and the pups playing volleyball. When Turbot passes the ball to Wally, he spikes it away with his trusty Wally Spinner, earning a good laugh from everyone."

The story starts with Chase, Zuma, and Rocky enjoying some free time with Ryder at the pup park.

Meanwhile, at Farmer Yumi's, she and Mr. Porter are heading out to harvest some freshly grown carrots for Mr. Porter back at his restaurant. When they start picking them, Yumi discovers that a row of her carrots have mysteriously vanished. Moments later, another row starts to suffer the same fate as the carrots are pulled back underground. After struggling to pull one carrot back out, but partially eaten, Farmer Yumi and Mr. Porter find the source of the carrots' disappearance: Very hungry bunnies. Farmer Yumi calls Ryder to let him know of the problem, and he calls the pups to the Lookout. Marshall has his usual crash into the elevator after the dust from the feather duster he was using sends him recoiling, via a sneeze, backwards and getting his head stuck in a bucket. Luckily, after the crash, the bucket is on Marshall's backside, rather than his head, earning laughs from the rest of the pups.

Once there, Skye is smitten by how cute the bunnies look, but Ryder reminds her that they need to find a place where the bunnies won't bother the Adventure Bay residents, and the locals won't bother the bunnies. The Lookout is a no-go as if there are too many bunnies for Farmer Yumi's, there's too many for the Lookout. With that, Ryder has Chase and Rubble join him on the mission, and off they go. At Farmer Yumi's, she and Mr. Porter have managed to save the majority of the carrots before the bunnies could get to them, although Mr. Porter has a snack of one himself, much to Farmer Yumi's amusement and annoyance.

When they arrive, Rubble gets right to work carefully digging the dirt up from around the carrot patch to find the bunnies' tunnels. Chase does his best to catch the bunnies, but they prove to be able to outsmart him by making him dizzy. Knowing that they have to lure the bunnies in, Ryder calls the Lookout to have Rocky retrieve some old pet carriers, and Skye to bring them to Yumi's to use to help lure the bunnies in.

When Skye arrives, Ryder, Farmer Yumi, and Mr. Porter plant carrots as bait in the carriers, and Chase calls the bunnies over to enjoy the carrots. The plan works, and Skye is soon departing to take the bunnies to a meadow where they will be safe and happy. Unknown to any of them, several bunnies did not fall for the trick, and stow away in Mr. Porter's van with the carrots he is taking back to his restaurant. When Mr. Porter arrives back at his restaurant, he discovers the bunnies, and soon is in over his head trying to catch them.

Back at Farmer Yumi's, Ryder and the pups find one stray bunny scaring Bettina, then get the call from Mr. Porter asking for help with the ones that rode with him back to his restaurant. When the PAW Patrol arrive, the bunnies are too numerous for them to catch, until Ryder has Mr. Porter lure them in with his carrot cake. It works, Chase nets them all, and it is time to get the bunnies where they will not bother anyone again.

At the bunnies' new home, Skye sees them off, and with the bunnies now happy and safe, the PAW Patrol head home, save for Skye, who finds she has some unexpected company in her helicopter. One bunny is able to sneak aboard, and Skye takes her home to the Lookout.

Back home, Rocky is loving Farmer Yumi's carrots, when Skye arrives and asks Ryder is she can keep the bunny that came back with her in her helicopter. Ryder agrees, knowing they can handle one bunny, and then feeds Skye and the bunny a carrot for their flips. However, two more show up, and Ryder agrees to feed them as well. The story ends as everyone laughs at how it seems no matter what, those bunnies always seem to keep popping up in numbers, no matter what they do to reign them all in.

Pup-Tacular:

Marshall and Rubble are at Katie's Pet Parlor. Rubble is taking a bubble bath because Katie is entering him in the Pup-Tacular, a puppy show where best-styled pup wins a trophy and a bone, which is mostly why Rubble let Katie enter him.

Zuma and Skye run in and remind the two pups that they have to do their safety inspection on their vehicles with Ryder. This means that Rubble can't be entered in the Pup-Tacular. Instead, Zuma lets Katie enter him in the Pup-Tacular.

Meanwhile, Marshall and Rubble have started their safety inspections on their vehicles while Ryder checks his ATV. He then gets a call from Mayor Goodway. While she and Chickaletta were having a picnic on the beach, Chickaletta accidentally dropped her rubber ducky into the bay. When Mayor Goodway rowed out in a rowboat with her to get it back, she accidentally dropped the oars into the bay. Now the tide is pushing them out to sea. Ryder knows this is an emergency, as does Mayor Goodway, and lets her know the PAW Patrol are on their way.

Ryder summons the pups, and Zuma has to apologize to Katie for being unable to participate in the Pup-Tacular as well. Katie wonders about sticking to the ""Kitty-Tacular"" which isn't coming anytime soon. When the pups reach the Lookout, Marshall accidentally soaks Zuma who says that it's the second bath he had on the same day, leaving Skye to joke as she suddenly looks disgusted and sniffs the air, mentioning that someone smells like a wet dog. Zuma shakes himself off, the pups reach the tower, and Ryder relays their duties to them. Rocky quips about how the rescue sounds like a wet one, and reminds the others of his dislike of water, much to their annoyance.

Ryder sets out with Zuma and Skye, while back at the Lookout, Marshall and Rubble head back to finish inspecting their vehicles. Katie calls asking about Zuma, but when she learns of Zuma being called to duty, she then wonders if Chase or Rocky want to be in the Pup-Tacular. Rocky can't because of his aquaphobia, but Chase is more than willing to volunteer, convincing Rocky to come with him over to Katie's.

Out in the bay, Skye spots the boat, and while Ryder and Zuma head over, Skye looks for the rubber duck. In her excitement over being rescued, Mayor Goodway accidentally causes the rowboat to rock, and launch Chickaletta overboard. Mayor Goodway is terrified for her chicken, but Ryder spots her, and Zuma goes to save her, while Skye has located the rubber duck, and retrieves it and returns it to Chickaletta herself. Zuma's attempt to rescue Chickaletta with his buoy is unsuccessful as Chickaletta's feet are unable to grip the buoy, and she slips off and back into the water, upside-down. Ryder takes over the rescue and is more successful in saving Chickaletta. Mayor Goodway is grateful, but devastated it was her fault Chickaletta is soaking wet, and in her panic, demands Ryder call Chase to provide police escort back to City Hall to clean Chickaletta up.

At Katie's, Chase is nearly ready for the Pup-Tacular when Ryder calls for his help, leaving Katie crushed once more at not having an entry for the Pup-Tacular again. Seeing Katie upset, Rocky, despite his fear of water, offers to be the entry instead. Katie is overjoyed and hugs Rocky, leaving him looking pretty pleased at being hugged by her. Rocky however, still lets his aquaphobia get the better of him, but when Katie says he doesn't have to go through with getting cleaned up for the Pup-Tacular, Rocky conquers his fear of water, for Katie's sake.

While Skye overlooks as Chase leads Ryder and Mayor Goodway on his ATV back to City Hall, at Katie's, Rocky is brushed, groomed, given a faux-hawk haircut, and a pair of sunglasses to complete his makeover. Afterwards, Katie and Rocky catch the train and make it to the Pup-Tacular.

At the Lookout, Marshall and Rubble finish their safety checks and join Ryder, Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, and the other pups to watch the Pup-Tacular. They're just in time to catch the Best Styled Mixed Breed part of the competition, which Katie and Rocky win. Afterwards, Ryder congratulates the PAW Patrol on all their help to Mayor Goodway and Katie, and enjoys playing some frisbee and soccer with them. Rocky even ends the story giving the others a good laugh when he splashes into a mud puddle, saying he's Pup-Tacular, Rocky-style."

As the story begins, Ryder is fixing up his ATV, and when Rocky comes by, he asks if he can lend a hand. Ryder agrees, and Rocky offers his pup-pack's claw arm to help give Ryder the tools he needs.

Meanwhile, Cap'n Turbot is out whale-watching, when he hears a loud bang. He notices that an oil tanker has scraped up against the rocks near the shoreline, and the hull has ruptured, leaking oil into the bay. After confirming if the tanker's captain is alright, Cap'n Turbot calls Ryder and notifies him of the environmental emergency. Things only get worse when Cap'n Turbot spots the mother whale and her baby heading for the Flounder and the tanker. Although Turbot is able to warn the mother whale to the danger, the baby whale doesn't hear the warning, and ends up diving and re-surfacing in the middle of the spill. With now both the oil spill and the baby whale covered in oil, Cap'n Turbot needs the PAW Patrol's help more than before. Ryder responds that they're on their way, and summons the pups to the Lookout.

Marshall has his usual run-in on the way to the elevator, and crashes into Rubble, spilling their food he was carrying, which Marshall finds delicious and wonders if it comes with extra cheese. After Marshall snacks on a few more pieces, and slips on several more on the way into the elevator, the pups arrive in the tower and get their orders: While Ryder and Zuma will head out to assist Cap'n Turbot and the tanker's captain, Marshall will rendezvous on the beach with Katie and Cali to help clean the oil off the baby whale.

Once Marshall arrives to assist Katie, Ryder and Zuma meet up with Cap'n Turbot and the tanker's captain, who offers a boat bumper as a plug to the hole where the oil is leaking out. With the spill having been stopped from getting bigger, Ryder now tries to look for the baby whale. Cap'n Turbot offers a bucket of fish to lure the baby whale, and Zuma uses his buoy to carry the bucket over to where Marshall and Katie are. The baby whale takes the bait, and follows Zuma to the beach. She is a little unhappy at the oil on her, but a fish meal from Katie cheers her up, and the baby whale enjoys being cleaned up by Katie and Marshall.

Back at the spill, with Cap'n Turbot not having anything to clean up the spill, Ryder calls Rocky to collect as many towels as he can, as they can tie them together into a long boom that can be used to soak the oil up. Thanks to a little recycling, the makeshift towel boom is able to clean up the spill, and prevent any other marine life from being harmed. Meanwhile, Katie and Marshall finish cleaning up the baby whale, who is soon reunited with her mother.

As the sun sets on Adventure Bay, the tanker blows its horn in thanks as it departs for the nearest harbor or shipyard for repairs, and Cap'n Turbot thanks the PAW Patrol for their help. The mother whale and her baby also offer their thanks, and Skye has the honor of dumping the bucket of fish down so the mother whale and her baby can have dinner. With the whales fed, Ryder has the pups head back to the Lookout to eat as well, with him and Katie running after them as Cap'n Turbot waves after them, and one last song of thanks from the mother whale is head to end the story.

Pups Save a Goodway:

The story begins with the PAW Patrol assisting Mayor Goodway with preparing for Great-great-great-great-Grandpa Grover Day to honor the original mayor of Adventure Bay, Grover Goodway, Mayor Goodway's great-great-great-great-grandfather. While all the other decorations are done, the statue of Grover has yet to show up. Mayor Goodway entrusted Cap'n Turbot to take the statue to be polished, cleaned, and returned in time for the celebration. Worried, she contacts him on his ship, the Flounder.

Cap'n Turbot is on his way back right now, but the baby whale happens to appear, forcing him to avoid her. In the process, Cap'n Turbot's evasive steering causes the statue to lose balance, and before Cap'n Turbot can catch it, the statue falls overboard. Not wanting to worry Mayor Goodway, Cap'n Turbot keeps what happened to a minimum, and then calls Ryder to tell him the truth. When Mayor Goodway learns of this, she grabs the pup-pad from Ryder and pleads to Cap'n Turbot that they have to get Grandpa Grover back. Following Mayor Goodway having a moment of amnesia in thinking she was talking to Cap'n Turbot on her own cellphone and not the pup-pad, she hands it back to Ryder, who assures her that the PAW Patrol is on the job.

Ryder calls the pups back to the Lookout, and while Skye flies back, the other pups run, while Marshall takes his firetruck. Marshall has a little accident when he soaks Rubble unintentionally, much to Rubble's annoyance, but Rubble forgives Marshall when he then crashes into the elevator and into Rubble himself, much to the amusement of the others. Upon reaching the tower, the orders are clear: Zuma and Skye will assist in retrieving Grandpa Grover's statue from underwater, and carry it back to City Hall. With that, Ryder, Zuma, and Skye deploy, and head for where Cap'n Turbot stopped the Flounder when the statue fell overboard.

When they reach the Flounder, Ryder uses his pup-pad's sonar ability to locate the statue, now resting on a rock outcropping near an underwater canyon. Zuma jokes at how the fish are gathering around the statue, and while Skye gets her sky hook ready to haul the statue up, Ryder changes to his scuba gear to head underwater with Zuma.

While getting to the statue is no problem, before they can hook Skye's hook onto the statue, the baby whale appears again, and as it passes, it hits the statue, knocking it off the outcropping, and closer to the edge of the canyon. No harm done, Ryder soon learns that the added depth is too deep for Skye's hook to extend to, and now they have to find an alternate means to retrieve the statue. Cap'n Turbot begins to panic at failing Mayor Goodway, but Ryder realizes that they can attempt to lift the statue using a balloon and helium.

Back at City Hall, Mayor Goodway is still panicking. Contacting Rocky, Ryder asks him to bring the helium tank and a spare balloon to the dock for Zuma to pick up. Rocky complies, and upon returning to the Flounder, while Cap'n Turbot and Skye watch with worry, Ryder and Zuma dive down, tie the balloon around the statue's waist, then fill it with helium. The plan works as the balloon floats the statue to the surface, but it soon starts to go airborne instead. Luckily, Ryder has Skye catch the rope and carry the statue back to City Hall, while he and Zuma will be right behind her once Ryder changes back to his regular clothes.

At City Hall, Mayor Goodway is still paranoid with fear, when Gustavo, Julius, and Julia arrive. She tries to figure out how to explain the absence of Grandpa Grover's statue, but as Gustavo snaps at her about Grandpa's whereabouts, Julius and Julia spot Skye bringing the statue home. When Ryder and Zuma arrive soon after, Mayor Goodway and Gustavo are proud of them from bringing Grandpa Grover back safely and with how shiny the statue looks. Following a squid that had been on the statue since it had been underwater jumping off on Mayor Goodway's head, and Ryder collecting in a pail, the Goodways, Ryder, Zuma, and Skye, get together for a group photo with the statue.

Afterwards, after showing the photo to the other pups, Ryder lets them go have some fun since they earned it. The PAW Patrol run off, barking happily, while Ryder has a final laugh to himself, before the story ends."

The story begins at the start of a hoedown in Adventure Bay. Ryder and the rest of the PAW Patrol are excited that Mayor Goodway and the rest of the citizens have put on a hoedown; Marshall is so excited that he does a tail spin, the result being Skye and Chickaletta taking shelter in a barrel of corn. Marshall bumps into the barrels and spins them around, until Skye and Chickaletta eventually knock into each other.

Meanwhile, at the train station, Farmer Al arrives with his five cows for a pit-stop. However, when Mr. Hudson blows the train whistle, it spooks all the cows out of their stall in the boxcar, and they run away in different directions. Farmer Al calls Ryder for help. With the hoedown interrupted, Ryder musters the PAW Patrol and deploys Chase to herd the cows and Skye as the eyes in the sky, while the rest return to the hoedown on stand-by.

Ryder and Chase arrive at the train station to see one cow running around, and Chase manages to herd it back into the train car.

Skye has spotted two cows down Hill Street causing traffic problems, and stampeding to Farmer Yumi's farm. As soon as Chase and Ryder arrive at the farm, the two cows split up. Chase goes after one while Ryder gets the other. As soon as they capture the cows, they report it to Farmer Al.

Skye, flying over the beach, has spotted a cow heading to a row boat. The cow boards the boat and drifts out to sea. Skye reports this and Ryder calls Zuma.

At the hoedown, while Zuma and Rubble are playing horseshoes, Zuma gets the call to go to the bay. Zuma, in his hovercraft, manages to grab the boat with his buoy and herd it to the train station.

While Chase takes his cows to the train station, Skye spots the last one at Mr. Porter's grocery. Ryder herds the last cow out, all the while they take a detour, parading through the hoedown, and into the train station just in time for Farmer Al and the train to leave. The story end with Ryder and the pups enjoying the rest of the hoedown.

Pups Save Alex:

The story starts with Rocky and Marshall busy trying to clean up Marshall's pup house, but they can't get much done with a rag. As if to answer their calls for help, Alex arrives on his super-trike with a bucket and sponge, but spins out on the puddle of water from Marshall's water cannons, causing the bucket to land on Marshall's head, and Rocky catching the sponge in his face. Alex apologizes, and the pups return to work with Alex helping them.

At Farmer Yumi's, Cali is playing with her toy mouse, when Chickaletta chooses to take it, and refuses to give it back. Cali pursues her to the roof of the barn, where Chickaletta trips on a gap between the roof shingles and drops the toy. Before Chickaletta can try and recover it, Cali takes it back and jumps to the roof of the silo, only to find her grip slipping as her claws tear roofing tiles off the silo and can't find a good anchoring point. Chickaletta doesn't pursue, instead, realizing it's her fault that Cali is now trapped and in trouble, she goes to tell Farmer Yumi. Once Yumi sees Cali in trouble, she tells her to hang on while she calls the PAW Patrol.

At the Lookout, Ryder is playing video-games on the pup-pad again, when he gets Yumi's call. At first, he thinks it is Bettina who is calling for help, but Yumi clears up the misunderstanding, and shows Ryder the real problem: Cali in trouble, and losing her grip. Ryder tells Yumi and Bettina not to worry, and after Bettina leaves a saliva mark on Yumi's cellphone, Ryder hangs up and calls the pups. Outside, Alex is still helping Marshall and Rocky when Ryder summons the pups, and wonders if he can join them. Marshall seems OK with it, and then heads for the elevator. This time, he tells Rocky he is going to make extra certain not to crash into any pups in the elevator. To do so, Marshall waits as the other pups enter the Lookout first, and he calls them by name, them barking in reply, except Zuma, who is upset over being woken up from a nap. Once he's certain it's clear, Marshall follows after the others, only for Alex, in his excitement, to crash into Marshall instead, and lead to both of them crashing into the other pups in the elevator. This time, it's Alex who apologizes for the accident, and the pups share a laugh before the elevator heads up. Zuma has fallen asleep again, but a nudge from Rocky quickly snaps him fully awake since he knows there is no sleeping on the job if Ryder needs him for trouble.

Once the elevator reaches the top, Alex is amazed to be in the Lookout itself, but does his best to stand at attention with the pups as Ryder briefs them on their latest emergency: Skye will attempt to try and get Cali into a pet carrier with her helicopter, while Marshall will attempt a rescue with his firetruck's ladder. Alex asks if he can help at all, but Ryder assures him that the pups have things well under control, much to Alex's disappointment. While Ryder heads down the fire pole to his ATV, and Alex looks down after him in amazement, Skye heads down the slide. When Alex goes to look at that as well, Marshall crashes into him, sending both down to Marshall's firetruck. Skye and Ryder have already deployed, so when Marshall's truck finishes transforming from his pup house, he checks to make sure Alex is okay. As Alex puts on his helmet and says he is ready to go, Marshall contacts Ryder to let him know of the situation. Ryder can only shake his head and laugh, but agrees that Alex can come along as long as he behaves himself. Alex promises, and Marshall heads out to join Skye and Ryder, with Alex along for the ride, even agreeing to let Alex turn on the siren as they head for Farmer Yumi's.

When the PAW Patrol arrive, Skye attempts to get Cali into the carrier, but Cali swats it away with an angry hiss, then scampers onto the center of the silo roof itself. Realizing the carrier won't work since Cali is too frightened, Ryder has Skye return to the Lookout with the carrier, then return for Plan B: Marshall and his firetruck. Marshall's first attempt fails when Cali drops her toy, then jumps on Marshall's head, blinding him with his own helmet, forcing her to retreat to the silo roof while Marshall bounces down his ladder and out onto the ground. As everyone wonders how they can lure Cali into coming down with Marshall, Alex, who had picked up Cali's dropped toy mouse, and notices Cali reach out for it, gets an idea. Only after Ryder draws blanks on ideas from Farmer Yumi, Bettina, and Chickaletta, does he then listen to Alex, who suggests that they use Cali's toy to lure her into coming down. Ryder agrees, and gives the toy to Marshall, who groans at the taste of cat breath in his mouth, but goes ahead with the plan.

The plan works perfectly, as Cali is attracted to her toy, leaps onto Marshall's helmet again, but this time, both her and Marshall bounce down the ladder to both the ground and safety. As Ryder, Skye, and Farmer Yumi run over to Marshall, Skye is amazed that Marshall saved Cali, who picks up her toy and walks away, giggling. Ryder however, points out Alex is the person who saved Cali. Alex says the PAW Patrol did most of the work, he just helped, but it seems Cali is very grateful for Alex's help, rubbing against his leg and purring happily.

As Ryder suggests that whenever you are in trouble, just yelp for help, or Alex, leaving everyone laughing and even Marshall joking on calling Alex the ""Alex Patrol"", later, back at the Lookout, Ryder congratulates the pups on another job well done. He also congratulates Alex for his assistance in Cali's rescue, and officially makes him an Honorary Member of the PAW Patrol, complete with his own PAW Patrol badge. Alex is amazed, and thanks Ryder and the pups for everything, declaring this to be the best day ever! The pups think so as well, as Skye tackles him to the floor. After Alex scratches Chase and Marshall, telling the pups that they are all good pups, the story ends with the pups all licking Alex as he laughs happily over the great day he just had with the PAW Patrol."

The story starts with the PAW Patrol waking and enjoying some yoga before breakfast. Chase is leading the session, but Marshall is still tired, and yawns his way through before finally going back to sleep, earning a laugh from the other pups as Rocky announces that Marshall is doing the ""snoring dog"".

Meanwhile, at Mr. Porter's restaurant, Alex is getting ready for his first day of school, but there's a problem: His brand-new red backpack is missing. Fearing he is now unable to go aboard the school bus when it arrives, Alex calls Ryder for help, just as Ryder is about to give the pups breakfast. Once Alex asks the PAW Patrol to help him find his backpack, Ryder agrees and calls the pups.

Once topside, the pups feel sorry for Alex when they learn of his plight. Ryder decides to have Chase accompany him to interview Alex on his backpack's last known whereabouts, while Skye will trail the school bus and relay its location back to Ryder. With that, the PAW Patrol deploy, and Skye soon has the school bus in her sights, busy picking up kids in the residential area on Hill Street.

At Mr. Porter's, Alex does his best to retrace his steps on where he had his backpack last, but due to how he had it in numerous places around Adventure Bay, Ryder and Chase remain at the restaurant to continue getting details, while Ryder dispatches the other pups to check the locations Alex mentioned.

First off, Marshall heads to the park to look there, but only finds a red balloon stuck in a tree with the aid of his gosling friend Fuzzy.

At the beach, Zuma only finds an old, red life jacket that he takes from Wally the Walrus to help clean up the bay, thanking Wally for his help.

Rubble tries Farmer Yumi's, but only finds one of her red bandannas under some hay bales.

Rocky's attempt at City Hall only results in him accidentally taking Mayor Goodway's red purse off her shoulder, causing her to fall over, and Rocky to apologize to Mayor Goodway, and Chickaletta when she springs up out of the purse.

With the school bus now heading down Main Street towards Mr. Porter's, Alex's latest memory recall mentions that he had his backpack at the train station. Ryder and Chase hurry over, and spot the backpack hanging from the railing on the caboose of the train. As they approach, the backpack starts to move about, and a familiar gray tail pokes out of the top of the backpack with a curious, muffled meow. Thanks to his allergies, it doesn't take Chase long to figure out that it's Cali, attracted to the tuna fish sandwich Alex was going to have for lunch at school.

However, the train starts to depart, and with Cali now trapped in the backpack, getting a free ride down the rails, Ryder calls Skye to airlift him after the train to get Cali and the backpack back. While Ryder goes after Cali and Alex's backpack, back at Mr. Porter's, with the school bus now about to arrive to pick Alex up, Alex is disheartened by being unable to take his backpack to school, and apologizes to his grandfather for losing it. Back at the train, Ryder is soon swung close enough to retrieve the backpack, and while Cali scurries onto Ryder's back for safety, Skye carries them both back to Mr. Porter's.

Alex is just about to board the school bus when Ryder returns and drops him his backpack. Alex is so happy that he has his backpack for school again, and thanks Ryder for his help. Ryder never even gets a chance to finish saying the PAW Patrol motto before Skye airlifts him to head back to the Lookout. Alex soon notices that someone ate his tuna fish sandwich, and while Cali lets off a giggle as being the culprit, Alex waves goodbye to his grandfather as the school bus departs, and Mr. Porter wishes his grandson a great first day of school.

Back at the Lookout, the pups are ready to eat their breakfast, and Ryder is quick to feed all of them. Once the pups are digging in to their food, Ryder hears a meow, and turns to find Cali having joined the pups, wanting some breakfast as well. Ryder doesn't forget her, and gives her a tuna fish sandwich. As Cali joins the PAW Patrol in digging into their breakfast, the story ends with Ryder laughing as the pups and Cali enjoys their food.

Pups Turn on the Lights:

The story begins with Skye and Rubble sneaking to Katie's Pet Parlor in the evening, as that is the location for where they are holding a surprise birthday party for Chase. Rocky decorates the clinic with streamers, accidentally spreading one over Cali. Katie preps for doing the cake, and all the pups are helping out to make it perfect. Meanwhile, Marshall keeps Chase busy so the others can finish the preparations.

However, the weather is pretty windy, and at the wind turbine farm providing power to Adventure Bay, the wind gets so strong that one of the blades on one of the turbines can't take the stress and snaps off, disabling the turbine, and reducing the power output. The effects are immediate: The lights at the clinic go out, and Katie's mixer dies while she is still mixing the cake batter for Chase's birthday cake.

The pups are worried as the rest of the street is dark as well. As Ryder guesses the turbine is broken, the pups fear that Chase's party is ruined, Skye even howling in sadness. But, Ryder refuses to let Chase's party be ruined by a simple power blackout, and calls the pups to the Lookout to investigate.

Marshall and Chase get there first, but due to the Lookout also being hooked up to the power grid, the electronic doors are disabled, and Marshall crashes into them. Before they can warn the other pups, Skye, Zuma, and Rubble suffer the same fate as they bump into the doors, and Marshall and Chase, causing a pile-up. Ryder and Rocky arrive, with Rocky lending the screwdriver from his pup-pack's tools to help Ryder pry the doors open so the pups can suit up and grab their pup-packs. While the pups grab their gear, Ryder has Marshall lend his firetruck's ladder to him so he can climb up to the Lookout's upper level, pry the door up there open, and check the periscope to see what happened to the turbines. Once Ryder sees the reason is a broken blade, he heads down the fire pole as always, only now darkened due to the blackout, and meets up with the pups outside.

With the power out, Ryder uses his pup-pad to give the pups their briefing and orders: Rocky and Marshall will assist Ryder with repairing the turbine, while Chase does his duties as police pup to control traffic with the traffic lights disabled due to the blackout. As for Skye, Zuma, and Rubble, they will help Katie with finishing Chase's birthday party, even if it is in the dark. Ryder makes sure Chase is out of earshot to hear about his birthday surprise. As the pups deploy, Ryder has another problem with the blackout: He has to struggle to manually open the garage door for his ATV before he can deploy as well. Once he gets it open, the PAW Patrol head out, while Skye, Zuma, and Rubble decide to hold Chase's party in the dark if the power is not restored in time.

In town, the blackout is already causing trouble: traffic jams up and down Main Street, and the gridlock is preventing Mayor Goodway and the citizens from using the crosswalk. Worse, it is getting dark out as the sun sets. Chase arrives just in time, and is able to clear the gridlock and allow Mayor Goodway and the citizens to cross safely.

Meanwhile, Ryder, Rocky, and Marshall arrive at the wind farm, and set about with the repairs to the damaged turbine. While Ryder climbs up and removes the broken blade, Rocky finds their spare blade in the form of Zuma's old surfboard. Once Rocky attaches the surfboard into the slot where the broken blade was and comes down, a fresh gust of wind comes in, and the surfboard is able to catch it, allowing the turbine to resume turning again, restoring the power to Adventure Bay.

Back at Katie's, while the power is still out, the pups and Katie find other means for enjoyment at the party, like shadow puppets and flashlight tag. They are barely enjoying the flashlight tag before the power is restored. The pups and Katie are happy, but Skye is disappointed at how there is no time to finish Chase's birthday cake. Luckily, Katie is able to find a solution to the cake problem.

Back at Main Street, the restored power allows the traffic lights to come back online, much to Chase's happiness, and as the last of the citizens he helped cross the street thank Chase for all his help, Chase packs up his megaphone and returns to his truck.

Ryder soon calls, telling Chase to rendezvous with them at Katie's as soon as possible, and Chase heads out with his siren blaring. When Chase reaches the Pet Parlor and heads inside, it is dark, until the others turn on the lights and wish Chase a happy birthday. Chase is amazed, and loves his dog cookie cake that Katie made to make up for being unable to finish a regular cake. Ryder then adds on that while it may be Chase's party, all the pups did good, and are allowed to dig into Chase's cake with him. Skye then turns off the lights so they can play some more flashlight tag and do more shadow puppets, and the story ends as Katie tells Chase he's it now, and Chase replies with his catchphrase, ""Chase is on the case!"", leading to a round of laughter from inside the parlor."

The story begins on a hot day in Adventure Bay, as Rocky and Rubble finish up working on the sand at the playground, then collapse in exhaustion from the heat. Realizing the pool is opening up today, they head over to the pool but discover that the pool is empty. Deciding this is a job for the PAW Patrol, Rocky and Rubble run off to find Ryder.

At the Lookout, Skye is getting ready herself, and calls to Marshall to hurry up. Marshall goes a little overboard with everything he needs, but he is ready to get good and wet.

As a couple of the citizens cheer Rubble and Rocky as they run past, the duo soon bump into Ryder outside Mr. Porter's restaurant. Alex joins them just in time to hear the pups mention the pool being empty. As Alex worries about the empty pool, Ryder assures him everything will be fine, and calls the PAW Patrol to the Lookout.

When the pups arrive, Marshall ends up bouncing into the elevator due to his floaty, and asks how he did. The other pups offer their scores, leaving them all to share a good laugh when Marshall sees the variety in the indecision of his judges. Once at the top, Ryder gives them their orders: Marshall and Rubble will go with Ryder to the town's water tower to investigate what is causing the water to be unable to get to the pool. Zuma and Skye can go to the pool and try to keep the spirits of Alex and the other kids up. With that, the pups deploy and head out.

When Ryder, Marshall, and Rubble arrive at the water tower, they discover one of the concrete support pads has slipped free of its spot, causing the water tower to lean over and cause the section of pipe above the valve to buckle and collapse inward from the stress. Seeing that they need further assistance, Ryder calls Chase and Rocky to lend a paw with their winch and forklift respectively. Chase and Rocky are ready to go - that is, they will be, once Chase takes off Skye's swimming cap.

Meanwhile, at the pool, the kids sigh over the lack of water, and Skye and Zuma feel sorry for them. Zuma gets an idea and goes to Mr. Porter's to get some ice cream bars and popsicles for the kids. When he gets back though, the heat has reduced all of them into melted goo.

Back at the water tower, Chase and Rocky arrive, and Ryder relays orders to them: Chase will equip his winch, Marshall will use his ladder to anchor it onto the water tower so Chase can lift it up, Rubble will lay down fresh dirt and gravel to help keep the concrete pad from slipping again, and Rocky will use his forklift to raise the heavy concrete slab and move it clear until the dirt and fresh gravel are in place.

Back at the pool, as Alex again laments over no water yet, Skye gets an idea and flies to Jake's Mountain to retrieve some snow for the kids to play with until the pool fills up. The kids are grateful, but Zuma soon finds himself buried in snow, joking at how first he was a hot dog, now he's a pup-sicle, and then shivering from how cold the snow is.

Meanwhile, back at the water tower, with Ryder supervising the effort, the water tower's concrete slab is soon put back in place, and the water tower is lowered back onto it, this time, the slab stays in place, and the tower is balanced and level. All that is left to do is replace the bent pipe and the PAW Patrol can send the water through to the pool. Rocky has a spare piece in his truck, and once Ryder closes the valve, Rocky uses his wrench to remove the dented piece, and place the new, reinforced piece into the spot. Once it's secured, Ryder prepares to turn the water back on.

Back at the pool, Alex is enjoying being rocked back and forth on an inflatable raft by Katie and Zuma, when the inflatable springs a leak and deflates, Zuma apparently puncturing it with his teeth by accident. As Skye laughs, Ryder contacts her to let her know that the repairs are done and he is about to turn the water back on, so let everyone know. Skye does just that, and everyone gathers to watch the pool fill up. At first, all that happens is some gurgling and the water only filling the drain, much to everyone's disappointment, but then, the water shoots out like a geyser, much to everyone's happiness. Alex is ready to get wet, but Zuma, being the water safety pup, tells them to wait until the pool fills up completely. Once it does, Zuma gives the OK for Alex, Julius, Julia, and Precious' owner, to enjoy themselves, while Katie relaxes poolside. Ryder and the other pups arrive, and Alex thanks them for everything they have done.

A little while later, Chase and Rocky are set up to judge the cannonball contest with Rocky hoping he is safe in the lifeguard's seat. As Chase gives the command, Skye, Rubble, Zuma, and Marshall jump into the pool, but the resulting splash still soaks Rocky, and he gives them a ""0"" for splashing the judge, much to Katie and Ryder's amusement to end the story.

Circus Pup-Formers:

The story begins with Chase introducing the pups as they perform their circus acts, ending with Marshall ending up getting three buckets stuck on his head, much to his unhappiness since it was due to his clumsiness. Up on the Lookout, Ryder is enjoying his cereal when he receives a call from Ringmaster Raimundo. Unfortunately, the trains carrying the circus have become separated. The train carrying the equipment and Eunice and Ellie made it safely, but the second one carrying all the other animals and performers is disabled and might not make it in time due to the repair work being done to fix it. Raimundo needs help, and Ryder agrees to bring the PAW Patrol to assist with setting up the big top.

Ryder calls the pups, and after Marshall crashes into the elevator, losing two of the buckets on his head in the process, the team arrive in the tower and learn of Raimundo's need of assistance. The pups are all needed this time, and the whole PAW Patrol head out to the running track where Raimundo is waiting with the equipment and the circus elephants. With the pups' help, the big top is soon up, but there is still no sign of the second train. Raimundo gets a call from his circus lion Leo, who is upset over the repair delays, and tries to calm him down while Ryder worries as well. The repairs of the second train is taking longer than they expected. Mayor Goodway, Jake, Katie, Cali, and several other citizens are already lined up to see the show.

Soon, Ryder and the pups take their seats in the audience, but Raimundo takes center ring with really bad news: The second train is still delayed, so the circus will have to be canceled. Refusing to let everyone be disappointed, Ryder offers the PAW Patrol to perform in the place of Raimundo's missing cast. Once Marshall shows off more of his clown clumsiness in a demonstration, Raimundo hands the reigns of the show over to Ryder.

Skye attempts to do the tightrope, but when she falls, she uses her pup-pack to fly to safety. Marshall joins in performing a clown routine with his water cannons, and the pups have a little fun with Ryder as he juggles pup treats. Soon, the grand finale takes place, and the pups spring off a springboard to form a pyramid on top of Eunice while Ellie poses alongside her mom.

As everyone cheers for Eunice, Ellie, Ryder, and the PAW Patrol, Raimundo has good news: The second train's repairs are finally done, and the rest of the circus crew are on their way. Raimundo thanks the PAW Patrol for all their help and, in a circus-related twist ending, Ryder takes the pups home in a clown car, as Raimundo, the circus elephants, and the audience thank them as they depart."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3461700/?ref_=ttep_ep18,,It's Adventure Bay's annual Easter Egg hunt and the pups are helping Mayor Goodway with the egg decorating. The hunt for a very special egg leads Ryder and the PAW Patrol on an exciting adventure.,[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"It's Easter time in Adventure Bay, and the pups are busy practicing and training for the upcoming Easter Egg Hunt at City Hall, including Skye locating eggs with her goggles. They even mistake a bunny's tail for an egg and have a good laugh about it. Marshall brings buckets full of eggs, but they fall out and crack, leaving raw whites and yolks, because he hadn't known they needed to be hard-boiled first, making the shells more durable.

At City Hall, Mayor Goodway, dressed in a pink-striped outfit from her usual attire with a pair of bunny ears on her head, is busy painting eggs for the egg hunt with Alex while Chickaletta is busy pecking away at a jellybean. However, with just her and Alex doing it, Mayor Goodway is getting a little exhausted from all the work. Unfortunately, Chickaletta knocks her jellybean off the table, and in her pursuit of it, accidentally causes Mayor Goodway to trip over her and sprain her arm.

At the Lookout, Ryder soon gets a call from Mayor Goodway and Alex asking for help since with Mayor Goodway injured, they can't finish painting the eggs in time for the Egg Hunt. Ryder agrees and calls the PAW Patrol to hand out their orders. All the pups are needed for this assignment, especially to decorate the eggs, and they soon deploy to lend a hand. With the pups' help (during which they sing a short song about Easter), the eggs are done in time, and Alex even adds a larger egg he found and painted himself to be used in the hunt.

However, the mother eagle soon appears overhead and, without warning, snatches the entire basket full of eggs and candy, and flies back to her nest, taking Rocky and Chickaletta with her as they were in the basket at the time.

Ryder soon realizes that the large egg Alex found must be the Mother Eagle's egg, and she was only taking back what was stolen from her. Alex is upset over having goofed up like he did, but Ryder assures him that when you find an egg in the wild, it is best to leave it alone. With the basket, Rocky, and Chickaletta in need of rescuing, the PAW Patrol deploy to go help. Skye tries to pursue the Mother Eagle and take the basket back, but the Mother Eagle forces her to retreat without it. Skye and Zuma stay behind with Mayor Goodway and Alex when Rubble returns from Farmer Yumi's with several bunnies to celebrate Easter with, while Ryder, Chase, Marshall, and Rubble go to help Rocky and Chickaletta. Following Alex's info on where he found the Mother Eagle's egg, up along the old fire road, Ryder heads out to save Rocky, Chickaletta, and the Easter basket.

After dropping the basket off at her nest, the Mother Eagle departs to find food. Rocky, upon seeing that they are trapped for the time being, watches as Chickaletta acts on her instincts, and egg-sits for the Mother Eagle, causing the egg to partially hatch so the baby eagle's legs and feet stick out of the bottom of the egg. Nicknaming the baby eagle ""Little Eggle,"" Rocky is about to move it from the basket back to the nest, but is interrupted by the Mother Eagle's return, and fears she is angry upon seeing him with her young-ling.

On the old fire road below, Ryder and the pups' path to the nest is blocked by rocks, but Rubble moves them aside easily with his rig. When they arrive at the nest, Rocky tries to apologize to the Mother Eagle, but she offers him a worm to eat. While Rocky doesn't want it, Chickaletta accepts it as thanks from the Mother Eagle for her egg-sitting. When they hear Ryder below, Ryder sees that they will have to distract the Mother Eagle in order to get Rocky and Chickaletta down and retrieve the basket. Knowing an eagle's love of fish as one of its favorite foods, Ryder has Zuma go see Cap'n Turbot for a bucket of fish, while Skye carries the bucket up to the nest. Marshall is a little unnerved by the Mother Eagle staring down at them vigilantly, without even blinking, but soon is relieved when Skye returns. Skye is able to lure the Mother Eagle away with the fish, and upon dropping the bucket off on open ground, the Mother Eagle happily digs into the fresh seafood.

With the Mother Eagle distracted, Rocky is able to return Little Eggle to the nest, but in his attempts to climb out of the basket, he loses his balance and falls out. Thanks to Chase's quick reaction with using his net, Rocky avoids being seriously hurt, and Skye takes care of recovering the basket while Chickaletta hops out when Marshall comes to rescue her and Rocky, coming down with Marshall before he was ready. Now that the baby eagle is back in the nest, and the mother will not come looking around Adventure Bay for it again, the team heads back to City Hall.

Once the PAW Patrol return to City Hall with the basket and the goodies inside safe, along with Rocky and Chickaletta, it is not long before the pups and the kids are able to enjoy the Easter Egg Hunt. Alex is at first upset over the loss of his egg, but Ryder assures him that Little Eggle is back with his mom, where it belongs. The kids and pups are soon enjoying the egg hunt and other activities, such as Chase cheering up Julius by bringing an egg to him, and Marshall winning the race with balancing an egg on a spoon in his mouth.

Later that day, the pups and Ryder are in the Lookout, relaxing after having such a fun and exciting Easter celebration. Rubble wonders about how Little Eggle is doing, and Ryder offers the pups a chance to see on the view screen after he checks the periscope. The pups watch as Little Eggle fully hatches, and even sprouts three multicolored feathers on its head. The pups can only go ""Aw!"" as they watch Little Eggle and his mom nuzzle lovingly, as the story ends."

As the story begins, Chase, Marshall, and Rocky are watching their favorite show, Apollo the Super-Pup. Below, Rubble is woken from his sleep by Apollo's theme song, causing him to retreat into his pup house and re-emerge decked out in his vest, and a mask and cape just like Apollo's. Joining the other pups, Rubble enjoys watching Apollo, quite over-enthusiastically, then decides to be just like him by trying to help out the citizens of Adventure Bay as a Super Pup himself.

What follows is a collection of Rubble's heroics in trying to be like Apollo, saying he can do it on his own and does not need any help, including trying to help out Farmer Yumi with finding something she dropped. Reality sets in for Rubble when he attempts to help Engineer Ed with clearing a small rock-slide at the end of the train tunnel. Rubble believes he can do it himself, but when a second, heavier rock-slide occurs after Rubble's attempts to clear the first one fail, blocking both tunnel entrances completely, Rubble collapses in defeat and guilt over having let his ego get the better of him. Engineer Ed manages to cheer him up and remind him of the power of teamwork, and Rubble contacts Ryder to let him know that both he and Engineer Ed are trapped in the tunnel and need help getting out. Ryder assures Rubble that the other pups are on their way, and summons the rest of them to the Lookout.

When they arrive, they notice that Rubble is missing. Ryder reveals the situation regarding Rubble and the rock-slide, and selects Chase and Zuma to help with the rescue. Since they need Rubble's rig to clear the rocks, Zuma is temporarily assigned the role of driving Rubble's rig until they can get Rubble out and he can take over. Right as the team deploys, it's clear Zuma has little experience with driving another pup's vehicle besides his hovercraft, as he almost ends up driving Rubble's rig backward down the driveway before turning it around and getting the hang of it.

When the PAW Patrol reach the tunnel, Zuma gets Rubble's attention when he bumps into the rock-slide by accident since he could not find the brake in time. Chase attaches his winch to one of the smaller rocks to pull it away and create a gap for Rubble to squeeze through. Once Rubble's out, he asks about his rig, only for him and Chase to wince and cover their eyes as Zuma struggles with all the controls for driving the rig, using the bulldozer, and working the drill. Once Zuma is finally able to stop, he is more than happy to hand controls back to Rubble with a sheepish laugh. Back in control of his rig, Rubble gets right to work, and the tunnel is soon cleared, allowing Engineer Ed to drive the train out.

Before heading off, Engineer Ed thanks the team, and especially Rubble, for all their help, and Rubble learns a valuable lesson about how one can save the day in their own special way instead of trying to do it like their hero. The story ends as Rubble is more than happy to join the rest of the pups in some playtime now that he knows that teamwork is always better than trying to do it on one's own.

Pups Save Ryder's Robot:

The story opens from the perspective of the newly-built Robo-Dog, having just been activated as Ryder finishes making the last of his modifications in building it. Rocky questions if the robot is working and Ryder responds with uncertainty, deciding to test the robot by using its complementary remote control. Ryder instructs Robo-Dog to walk, which Robo-Dog does accordingly while barking. Ryder is excited with the success and tests Robo-Dog further by getting it to sit (which Robo-Dog accomplishes without error). Skye and Rubble walk over and compliment Ryder's robot, before Ryder commands it to dig. Robo-Dog digs with ease, to Rubble's shock. When it doesn't come back to the surface, Skye, Rubble, and Ryder wonder where Robo-Dog went.

A short distance away, Robo-Dog emerges from the ground directly into Zuma's pup-house, knocking Zuma both awake and into the open. Zuma is surprised with Robo-Dog's sudden appearance and Ryder comes over to apologize for the disturbance. Ryder then tries Robo-Dog's flight mechanism, which works perfectly. After it lands, Marshall comes by and questions what else the robot can do. Ryder responds by saying Robo-Dog should be super fast, to which Marshall confidently states that he is faster. Marshall decides to race Robo-Dog, and Chase brings out his megaphone to start the race.

During the race, Marshall repeatedly trips, but otherwise keeps pace with Robo-Dog while getting supportive cheers from the sidelines by the other pups. Midway through, Ryder activates turbo-mode and Robo-Dog zooms well ahead of Marshall. Determined to keep up, Marshall runs his fastest but stumbles on a hedge. Robo-Dog wins the race while speeding past Ryder and stopping, while Marshall ends up knocking Ryder off-balance; ultimately falling onto Robo-Dog.

Rocky rushes over and worries about Robo-Dog, while Marshall points out its mangled antenna. Robo-Dog begins to go haywire, digging many holes before eventually failing to come back up. Ryder states that he cannot control the robot with the remote (due to the malfunctioning antenna), and everyone worries about where Robo-Dog went and what it might do.

Meanwhile at Mr. Porter's cafe, Mr. Porter is serving an outdoor customer a Porter Burger. Just as the customer is about to take a bite, Robo-Dog flies by and steals it from his grasp. It then crashes through the fruit stand and causes many pieces of fruit to land on both Mr. Porter's and the customer's heads in the style of fruit hats.

In the air, Robo-Dog discards the burger onto a car's windshield and flies around City Hall, terrifying residents including Mayor Goodway, who launches herself into a flower bush. She then immediately contacts Ryder about the situation and Ryder admits that it was his own Robo-Dog. The mayor instructs him to stop it, to which Ryder responds by summoning the PAW Patrol. As the pups head to the Lookout, Marshall warns Rocky of the holes in the ground before falling in one himself. The other pups all run up together, tripping over Marshall's head, into Rocky, and into the elevator as a dog-pile.

In the observatory, Ryder mentions the pups' knowledge on the malfunctioning Robo-Dog, and explains to them the messes it has already made around Adventure Bay. Ryder's solution is to capture it and use a power switch on the attached pup tag to shut Robo-Dog down, and later fix it. In order to do this, he calls on Skye to locate Robo-Dog as quickly as possible, and Rocky to come up with and build something to catch it. Ryder asks all the other pups to help clean up the mess Robo-Dog has left around town before deploying.

Skye flies to City Hall and spots Chickaletta and Mayor Goodway, who points her in the direction Robo-Dog had headed. Not seeing Robo-Dog at City Hall, Skye informs Ryder and continues searching. Ryder then spots Robo-Dog himself, and notices it flying toward the water tower. Moments later, Robo-Dog crashes unhindered through the water tower; punching two holes in it as it spills its contents.

Katie is later shown trying to get Cali to take a bath, unsuccessfully. While struggling to get Cali into the tub, Robo-Dog bursts through the wall; causing Katie to jump into the filled bathtub in shock. Robo-Dog later exits via the ceiling. Skye spots Robo-Dog soon after as it flies frantically through the air, and gives chase.

At Mr. Porter's restaurant, Zuma and Rubble help collect all of the fruit spilled by Robo-Dog and return it to the fruit stand. Just as they finish, Robo-Dog flies through it, scattering food everywhere and knocking over Mr. Porter in the process. Rocky and Ryder soon visit the scene and get told Robo-Dog's direction by the pups.

Skye finds Robo-Dog yet again, heading for her helicopter, and is asked by Ryder to get it close to Rocky's truck. She agrees to do what she can. Meanwhile down on land, Rocky sets up his catapult to launch a magnet in the hopes of it sticking to Robo-Dog and providing Skye with a surface to attach her hook to. As Robo-Dog passes by, the magnet is successfully attached to Robo-Dog and Skye deploys her hook. On the second try, Skye manages to capture Robo-Dog and bring it down to land.

Ryder shuts down Robo-Dog and states sadly that he'll have to work on improvements. But, Rocky runs in with a recycled antenna and gives it to Ryder to act as a replacement for the broken one. Ryder switches the antenna and reboots Robo-Dog, with positive results. Everyone is happy and excited to play with the fixed Robo-Dog, and afterward there is a montage of their fun and games. The story ends with Marshall dancing synchronously with Robo-Dog, and later falling on it after a tailspin. Everyone is momentarily worried about Robo-Dog's condition, but to everyone's relief, Robo-Dog (and its antenna), is perfectly fine."

The story begins with Katie and Ryder watching a video of Mandy the Monkey, who is sick and being cared for by the veterinarian in the big city. Now that Mandy is better, she is being transported by train back to the jungle, but the train is making a pit stop in Adventure Bay, and Katie wants to see how Mandy is doing.

At the train station, Marshall and Rubble are with Mr. Porter, as the same train carrying Mandy is also delivering a fresh shipment of produce for Mr. Porter's store. Mandy is fast asleep in her car, but when the train screeches to a stop, Mandy is flung from her swing and woken with a start. The sudden stop also cracks the door to her car open slightly, allowing her to escape outside and watch the unloading of Mr. Porter's produce.

After getting her hands on a banana dropped by Mr. Porter and the pups, Mandy hears Katie and Ryder coming, and flees for the front of the station. When Ryder and Katie discover Mandy's car open and Mandy gone, Mandy finds Mr. Porter's van, full of fresh bananas from the train, and not only digs in to her primate nature's favorite fruit, but even drives off with the van as well. Katie is horrified, knowing Mandy can't be allowed to rampage through town, and Ryder assures her he and the PAW Patrol will get Mandy back to her car. He calls the pups, they head to the Lookout, and Marshall has his usual crash into the elevator.

The orders are clear: Find Mandy, retrieve Mr. Porter's van, and get Mandy back to her car for transport to her jungle home. Ryder deploys with Chase and Skye, and they set off to find Mandy.

Skye spots Mandy as she drives wildly and crazily around City Hall. By the time Ryder and Chase catch up, Mandy has now driven Mr. Porter's van to where it is now locked on the railroad tracks, and another train is heading directly for her.

Chase tries to get Mandy to pull over, but gets a banana peel thrown in his face for his troubles. With the train getting closer, Ryder has no choice but to set his ATV to auto-pilot and commandeer the van from Mandy, steering it off the tracks just in time, and then bringing it to a stop.

Mandy, however, is still full of energy, and flees to the nearby playground, gaining the attention of Julius and Julia Goodway. Ryder and Chase try to lure Mandy down to catch her with a fresh banana, but the plan backfires, and Mandy, after giving Chase and Ryder a good raspberry for failing to catch her, flees once more on Ryder's own ATV.

While Chase resumes pursuit, Ryder gets a lift from Mr. Porter now that he had his van back, and find Mandy heading for the Lookout. While Skye provides over-watch, Ryder and Chase formulate a plan to finally catch Mandy. In the Lookout tower, Marshall is waiting for Mandy, but while Mandy enjoys the pillows and goes wild, Ryder and Chase arrive in the elevator and prepare for their plan. First off, Marshall seals the doors to the Lookout's balcony, trapping Mandy inside, and leaving her puzzled. Next, Ryder attempts to lure Mandy with another banana, but this time, he lures her into chasing it down the slide used by the pups to board their vehicles. Complete with a name call like the pups, Mandy goes down the slide, and lands in the back of Mr. Porter's van, where Mr. Porter and Katie close the doors and finally catch her. Ryder quickly reminds Mr. Porter to get in the driver's seat before Mandy gets there and steals the van again.

Back at the station, Mandy is back in her car, but now with a huge pile of bananas as well. As Mandy enjoys her meal, swinging back and forth with each time grabbing a fresh banana from the pile, the train departs to take her home. Katie, Ryder, and the pups see Mandy off, and are happy she is going home. Mr. Porter soon joins them, his van now fully loaded with his fresh produce, but is upset that Mandy ate all the bananas. Marshall is upset due to his own love for bananas, but Mr. Porter reveals he salvaged enough of them for some fresh banana muffins. Understanding what Mr. Porter wants them to do to get one, Marshall begins acting like a monkey. After Marshall is rewarded and continues acting like a monkey, the others join in, leaving Katie, Ryder, and Mr. Porter to laugh at the pups and their ""monkey business"".

Pups Save a Hoot:

The story begins with a windy morning in Adventure Bay, at a tree that is home to a mother owl and her baby. When the strong winds cause the trunk to crack, and the tree starts to fall, the mother owl orders her baby to flee, just in time. After the tree falls over, the baby owl goes to check on his mother, who is trapped in the knothole where they live, unable to escape. Although the mother owl tries to show her baby she's fine, the wind picks up again, carrying the baby owl all the way to the Lookout.

The baby owl arrives and passes by Rubble's pup house, then bumps into the door of Chase's pup house, waking him up. As Chase gives the baby owl the name ""Little Hootie"", he wonders what's wrong. As Little Hootie hoots his emergency, he then wants Chase to follow him. Chase follows Little Hootie all the way back to his tree, where Little Hootie reveals that his mother is trapped inside. Chase attempts to dig an opening out from under the tree, but he is forced to stop when the tree slides further towards the cliff edge. Fearing for the owl inside, Chase knows they need more help, and takes Little Hootie back to the Lookout to get Ryder.

Ryder is doing his repairs on the engine on his ATV when Chase calls him. As Chase tells about his friend and the problem, Ryder is impressed that Chase can understand Little Hootie's hoots, and agrees to help. After Marshall crashes into Chase as Chase warns him to watch out for Little Hootie, the pups get topside and get their orders: Chase and Rubble will go with Ryder to try and prevent the tree from going over the cliff edge, and create a means for the larger owl to escape before the tree goes over. The PAW Patrol deploys, and upon reaching the tree, get right to work, at least after Chase saves Little Hootie when he falls off the severed trunk as he falls asleep, due to owls normally being nocturnal. With Little Hootie asleep in Chase's hat, Chase leaves him on a flat rock then gets to work, quietly barking to activate his winch.

Once Chase has secured his winch, Rubble starts digging. Little Hootie wakes up to check on his mother, but the tree begins to slip further toward the cliff edge. Chase's police truck is being dragged after it by his winch, but he is able to anchor it against a large rock to stabilize the tree. Chase knows the branch that his winch is wrapped around will not last much longer, but Rubble figures something out and uses his bulldozer to lift the tree high enough for Little Hootie's mom to escape, and just in time as well. The branch finally snaps, and the tree slides over the edge completely and into the sea.

With Little Hootie and his mother safe, Chase introduces himself to Mama Hootie, and even Rubble recognizes the response, saying that ""you don't have to speak Owl, to tell that was a thank you."" Chase responds by telling her ""You're welcome. Whenever you're in trouble, just hoot for help!""

Chase soon finds a much thicker and sturdier tree for them to live in now. As Mama and Little Hootie move into their new home, Chase is saddened, until Rubble reminds him he can always visit them from time to time to see how they are doing. This perks Chase up, and he, Rubble, and Ryder quietly hoot ""sleep tight,"" to Little Hootie and his mother as they get a good day's sleep, while Ryder, Rubble, and Chase return to the Lookout, the story ending with a shot of Mama and Little Hootie as they sleep peacefully in their new home."

The story starts with the pups enjoying some playtime with Katie outside the Lookout. Katie is amazed that they've gone for half the day without the pups being called to an emergency, but her hopes fall when Ryder's pup-pad finally rings.

It's Mayor Goodway, and she needs help: She can't ring the City Hall bell to wake up Chickaletta, as a baby bat has fallen asleep underneath the large bell, and ringing the bell will wake it up and scare it. Ryder tells Mayor Goodway the PAW Patrol are on their way, and summons the pups. Marshall and Chase are deployed to help retrieve the bat without waking it, while Skye is deployed later to find the bat's cave in the mountains.

When they reach the City Hall, Marshall is about to get the baby bat into the pet carrier, but Chase accidentally wakes the bat up when he uses his megaphone to remind Marshall not to wake it himself. The result: Marshall is trapped in the pet carrier himself, and Chase ends up ensnaring himself and Marshall in his net. Despite the mess-up, Mayor Goodway can now use her bell-ringing app on her cellphone to ring the bell and wake Chickaletta up. Ryder wonders where the bat went now, and gets a call from Katie, revealing the baby bat is now sleeping on the crossbar of the goal at the soccer field.

When Ryder, Chase, and Marshall arrive, Alex makes a joke about how bats are for baseball, not soccer, earning a few laughs. Chase secures the area to ensure the bat sleeps this time, but when a seagull perches near the bat, Chase is forced to be lifted up by Ryder and Katie to quietly scare the seagull off. The bat starts to wake up after the seagull makes a loud squawk after being startled by Chase, but Chase is able to sing him back to sleep, allowing Marshall to come in and carefully get the bat into the pet carrier this time. Meanwhile, Skye finds the cave, and confirms it when she scans it with the thermal vision on her goggles.

When Chase and Ryder arrive, they attempt to convince the baby to rejoin its swarm, but the baby bat spots the mother eagle, and flees back into the pet carrier for safety. With the mother eagle's nest preventing the baby bat from entering the cave, the team have to look for another entrance. Skye finds one that the team can enter as well. Once Chase takes a look using the low-beam feature of his light, the baby bat is released, and rejoins its parents. Soon after, Ryder, Chase, and Skye watch as the baby bat and the swarm itself take off for breakfast due to the sun going down and bats being nocturnal, much to the pups amazement.

Back at the Lookout, the pups are having some last-minute fun before going to bed, but the baby bat shows up to join them. Ryder agrees to have the pups sleep outside with their new bat friend, and despite a pile-up occurring thanks to Marshall, Ryder leaves the pups and the baby bat to get a good night's sleep while he heads back to the Lookout for the night, the story ending with the camera zooming in on the pups, now fast asleep with their new friend.

Pups Save a Toof:

The story begins with Chase, Rubble, and Zuma sniffing for buried items in the yard around the Lookout. Chase and Rubble each smell something, and competitively, each dig up one end of a stinky old tug toy. As they vie for pulling it out from their dig spot, Zuma joins Rubble to make it two-against-one, winning the tug war and pulling the toy completely up from its bury spot. It is not long before Rubble and Chase start pulling on their ends of the toy, and while Zuma joins Rubble again, Marshall joins Chase to make it two-on-two. That is until Chase releases in shock due to a pain in his mouth, sending Marshall into a pile-up with the other pups. When Marshall asks what's wrong, Chase reveals that his puppy fang is loose by wiggling it with his tongue, and he now speaks with a lisp.

At Mr. Porter's cafe, Alex seems nervous about something, and his grandfather seems oblivious as he reminds Alex to get ready. As he is ready to start preparing to take Alex to the dentist for a checkup, Alex stops dead in his tracks at the mention of the dentist, and despite trying to show his grandfather his teeth are healthy, Mr. Porter goes to prepare the van.

Back at the Lookout, Ryder soon learns of Chase's loose tooth, but like Alex, the mention of the dentist sends Chase whimpering, while cowering, back to his pup house in sheer nervousness.

At Mr. Porter's, Alex has fled up into his tree house in an attempt to hide himself. When his grandfather tells him to come down, Alex purposefully unhinges several of the steps with a toy hammer, leading up to the tree house to trap himself up there. Alex thinks now it will take too long for his grandfather to find a ladder to get him down, and go to the dentist, but his spirits fall when his grandfather mentions calling the PAW Patrol to help.

Ryder is still trying to coax Chase into going to the dentist himself when Mr. Porter calls in regards to Alex. When Mr. Porter tries to show Ryder the situation with Alex, he ducks back into his tree house, out of sight, and even tries to tell both Ryder, and his grandfather, that he is OK not going to the dentist. Ryder assures Mr. Porter that they are on their way, but Alex tries to forestall seeing the dentist by asking Ryder not to hurry.

Ryder calls the pups, and after Marshall ties everyone up with the tug toy after getting the free end stuck in the entrance doors, causing it to snap back into Marshall and the others, they reach the top and get their orders: Ryder will go with Marshall and Chase to rescue Alex, and then provide Alex a police escort to the dentist.

The PAW Patrol deploy, and when they reach Mr. Porter's, Marshall gets right to work rescuing Alex. Alex is cowering in the corner of his treehouse, and when Marshall tries to coax him into coming down, Alex makes it clear he is not coming down, telling Marshall that he's scared of the dentist, and slamming the floor door shut in Marshall's face, leaving him confused. Seeing that he needs to talk to Alex boy-to-boy, Ryder offers to climb up and talk to Alex. Despite Ryder offering Alex a police escort from Chase to the dentist, he too gets the door slammed in his face when Alex agrees to the escort, but only to anywhere but the dentist. Not giving up, Ryder offers Alex a deal: If Ryder gets the PAW Patrol to show off what they are scared of, that will convince Alex to conquer his own fear. Alex shows interest in seeing what the pups are scared of, and Ryder agrees to call them to help out.

Once the rest of the pups show up, Ryder wonders which of them would be willing to show what they are scared of first. None of the pups seem too eager to volunteer, so Ryder goes first, revealing that while he goes into life-threatening situations every day with the pups, there is one thing that really gives Ryder nightmares: Brussels sprouts, and he asks Mr. Porter to fetch some. As everyone watches, Ryder is able to somehow swallow one, much to Alex's amusement, but it is still not enough to convince Alex to come down. Ryder however, shows that he was able to conquer his fear, so now it's the pups' turn.

Rocky volunteers to go next, knowing it would be best to get his aquaphobia, or fear of water, out of the way first, and has Marshall hose him down. Next up is Rubble and his arachnophobia, or fear of spiders. After that, it is Marshall and Skye's turn, with Marshall's fear of flying and Skye's fear of eagles. During Rubble's turn of facing his fear, Alex has moved from inside his tree house to sitting on the top rungs of Marshall's ladder, enjoying the PAW Patrol facing their fears. When it is over, Alex is finally convinced to overcoming his own fear and going to the dentist. However, Ryder has one last job for Alex: Chase is also afraid of the dentist, but if Alex shows him how brave he can be, it can help Chase overcome his fear as well.

With that, Chase nervously escorts Alex and Mr. Porter in their van, with Ryder following behind, to the Adventure Bay Dentist's Office. Upon arrival, Chase gulps in worry, but Alex suggests that they can walk in at the same time, as everyone else cheers. Soon everyone waits, bored, for Alex and Chase to emerge. When they do, they each have a sticker from the dentist for their good behavior, and Alex even got a brand new toothbrush out of it! Chase shows that even though his fang has been removed, an adult tooth will grow in its place, and he can even whistle through where it was.

Back at the Lookout, Chase wraps his tooth up in a cloth for the Tooth Fairy to collect. The next morning, Chase excitedly awakens the pups to reveal that the Tooth Fairy left him a brand-new bone for his tooth, but when Chase bites into it, another shot of pain occurs in his mouth, revealing that his other fang is now loose, ending the story as the rest of the pups all laugh."

The story starts with Skye and Rocky practicing for their camping trip with Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta for several new Pup Scout badges. Once they are all set, Ryder wishes them good luck as they set off into the woods.

Once on their own in the woods, Mayor Goodway is able to guide Skye and Rocky on the steps to setting up their tents and the campfire, including making sure that all flammable materials, like leaves and twigs, that could be ignited by a spark from the campfire, are out of the danger area. Once the campfire and tents are set up, the pups are excited to now go hunting for sticks for roasting marshmallows with. They split up, with Skye and Rocky going as one pair, and Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta as another.

While Mayor Goodway tries to find the right stick, Chickaletta is more interested in several berry bushes, but when attempting to reach one further away, she falls into a small crevasse. Mayor Goodway can't reach her, and goes to find Skye and Rocky. When she returns with the pups, Rocky's pup-pack's claw arm can't extend far enough into the crevasse to reach Chickaletta, and it is too narrow for Skye to use her pup-pack's wings in. With no other option, Mayor Goodway calls Ryder, while Chickaletta enjoys the berries on the bushes in the crevasse.

When Ryder gets word of Chickaletta in trouble, he summons the other pups and gives them their orders. With Chase and Rubble joining him for the rescue, Ryder heads out to meet up with the Mayor and the Pup Scouts.

When they arrive, Rubble clears away the rocks from the edge of the crevasse, and when Mayor Goodway still asks, in a panic, if Chickaletta is okay, a burp from her purse chicken leaves the Mayor a little embarrassed.

The PAW Patrol need to attach Chase's winch to one of the pups so they can descend and get Chickaletta, and Skye, being the smallest, volunteers. Afterwards, everyone is out of the crevasse.

With Chickaletta rescued, and the night sky clear and full of stars, Ryder and the other pups agree to spend the night with the Pup Scouts. Mayor Goodway, Rocky, and Skye worry that they don't have enough tents, but Marshall, Zuma, and Chase simply order their vehicles to convert back into their pup houses.

Mayor Goodway awards Ryder a special Pup Scouts badge for saving Chickaletta, and the gang enjoy a final laugh after Marshall accidentally soaks Rocky when he says he burnt the marshmallows, now leaving the marshmallows burnt and soggy.

Pups and the Trouble with Turtles:

The story begins with Rocky rousing for the day. He sleepily walks over to his water bowl and sees a baby turtle paddling in circles. The other pups find several more baby turtles around the Lookout, intrigued by this new find. Ryder finds one as well, while wondering where they all came from. Meanwhile, the pups give names to the turtles, with Skye naming her choice Star and Marshall's Joey. Ryder, in his own hands, attempts to locate the turtles' habitat within the Lookout's gadgets. After getting another turtle out of the periscope, Ryder notices that a pond near Farmer Yumi's is empty. Assuming that is the turtles' home, Ryder calls the pups. For once, Marshall doesn't crash into the elevator as he carefully and silently walks in, revealing that Star is fast asleep on his back. He even trails behind while joining the others, causing Ryder to ask what's the holdup before Marshall explains that if he walks at the speed of a turtle, he won't wake Star up, as she stretches and yawns before returning to sleep.

Ryder starts to brief them on the situation from what he saw through the periscope. He doesn't get far before the screen goes dead for some reason. Finding more turtles down in the area under the control panel, having messed with the wires, Ryder lets them out while Chase captures them in his net. Before Chase catches the turtles, Ryder restarts the screen and resumes the briefing, and asks Rubble to join him with heading to the pond. With that, Ryder and Rubble head out, while the other pups take care of Star and the other turtles.

When they arrive, they find one turtle still there in what water is left in the bottom of the pond. Assuring the turtle that his friends are on their way home, Ryder has Rubble dig a new hole for the underwater reservoir to use to fill up the pond.

Meanwhile, back at the Lookout, the pups finally find a solution to keep the turtles from wandering off by creating a playground for them.

Back at the pond, Rubble finally strikes home, and creates a new hole for the water to fill the pond. However, the pond is filling faster than expected, and Rubble is in danger of his rig being drowned as the pond fills. He tries to start it and escape, but water has already gotten into the engine and flooded it, stalling it out. With Rubble needing help, Ryder calls Chase and Zuma to come over and help. Acting quickly, Zuma takes Chase's winch and dives into the pond, wrapping the winch around the drill arm of Rubble's rig. With the winch secured, Chase pulls Rubble and his rig to safety. A little while later, the digger's engine is cleaned out and dried, and Rubble is able to restart it. With the pond refilled, Ryder calls Skye to let her know she can bring the turtles home.

Once they arrive, the turtles rejoin the one that was already there, but Star has a little more fun with Skye, tickling her before joining her friends, and then offering a wink of thanks to the PAW Patrol. Ryder ends the story with a remix of the PAW Patrol motto, saying that if Star or the other turtles ever need help again, they just have to tickle for help, as a turtle tickles Ryder by climbing up his back, earning laughs from the pups along with himself."

As the story opens, Marshall and Rubble are helping Farmer Yumi with planting seeds, while Chickaletta eats them before Yumi shoves her off for eating the seeds, and Chickaletta scoffs at Yumi before getting scared off by Alex Porter as he pretends to be a giant. Yumi decides it is really hot out, and decides to take a break. Rubble goes to sleep under a large tree, but as he dozes off, he takes one more look at Alex, then falls asleep.

As the scene transitions to Rubble's dream, he's awoken by Marshall, who is rising into the air on a huge beanstalk. Rubble orders Marshall down, but Marshall is unsure, until he sees Alex, now a giant straight out of Jack and the Beanstalk, climbing down. Yumi catches Marshall as he falls, and while Alex does his best to avoid causing damage, Marshall and Rubble decide to call Ryder. Once Ryder sees the situation, he summons the pups to the Lookout. Marshall is bounced inside by Alex's thundering footsteps, and the pups are in shock as Alex watches them go up the elevator. Once topside, it's clear all six pups are needed for this situation, but as they deploy, Alex interrupts the deployment as he helps Rubble down into his rig. As the team takes off, Ryder suggests they split up to cover more ground.

They soon find Alex playing with Cap'n Turbot's ship, the Flounder, but after getting him to put it down, he wanders off again, this time to City Hall to have some fun with Mayor Goodway (specifically lifting the roof off the building and grabbing her, believing it to be a game of hide-and-seek) before helping her find Chickaletta (by flinging her into Farmer Yumi's farm, where she safely lands on a pile of hay). Alex later wanders off to get some lemonade from the cup that's part of the lemonade stand's display, but leaves disappointed to his grandfather's restaurant for some fruit smoothies instead. Seeing that Alex loves his grandfather's smoothies, Ryder gets an idea on how to get him back up the beanstalk. Rubble and Rocky head off to get fruit from Farmer Yumi, while Chase and Marshall will recover the giant lemonade cup that Alex discarded earlier to use to lure him back up the beanstalk. Chase and Marshall are delayed heading to do their part when Alex picks up Chase's truck and plays with it, much to Chase's annoyance as Alex is tampering with official police property, and imitating a siren that neither Chase nor Marshall use. Alex finally sets Chase down, and off he and Marshall go.

They soon have things ready as Marshall fills the lemonade cup with the smoothie, and Skye airlifts it to get Alex's attention, as he was busy playing with Mr. Hudson and his train at the time. Skye is able to lure Alex back to the beanstalk, and back up for good. After a few tense moments of waiting to see if Skye comes back down, Skye returns safely, and the pups cheer. A loud burp from Alex ends the celebrations as he pardons himself and thanks the pups for playing with him. Afterwards, as Ryder congratulates the pups, the scene transitions back to reality from Rubble's dream as Rubble is awoken by Marshall, who's using his hose as a sprinkler to water the crops.

Rubble is still coming to from his dream, believing it was real, and tries to explain what he saw in it to everyone, but Ryder decides that Rubble needs to lay off the treats before bed. However, he assures Rubble that if he ever has another wild dream again, he can always turn to the PAW Patrol for help, ending the story as Rubble laughs at that assurance.

Pups Save the Turbots:

As the pups enjoy another day at the beach, Marshall suffers another of his clumsy crashes, and believes he is so dazed, he is seeing four legs on Cap'n Turbot instead of two. When he comes to, he finds that Cap'n Turbot is joined by his French cousin, Francois Turbot. It is also revealed that Cap'n Turbot's first name is Horatio. While Francois Turbot soon befriends the pups, and gains the admiration of Skye, Cap'n Turbot is on the lookout for the blue-footed booby bird.

While Cap'n Turbot tries to find the booby bird, Francois has some fun kite flying. Seeing Skye's adoration for Francois, Rubble tries to get her attention back by trying to imitate Francois, to little success. Wally soon helps Cap'n Turbot find the booby bird, but in his excitement, Cap'n Turbot falls off the Flounder, while the booby bird flies away. Worse, he left the Flounder in gear, and the boat takes off without him. He tasks Wally with telling Ryder of the situation, and the walrus does just that.

Wally soon finds Ryder, and Ryder is able to translate Wally's charades into learning of Cap'n Turbot's plight, and assures Wally that he'll call the pups. With that, Ryder calls the pups to the Lookout, and after Marshall and Rubble crash into the elevator, with Marshall gaining Rubble's beret and facial features from his Frenchman outfit, they reach the top and get their orders. Skye and Zuma will head out to help save Cap'n Turbot and get him back the Flounder. With that, the team deploys, and soon are able to rescue Cap'n Turbot, while Ryder commandeers the Flounder and is able to stop it.

Francois soon crash-lands on the ship, and agrees to help Cap'n Turbot find the booby bird. With Skye's help, the booby bird is soon spotted at its nest, but Francois takes off without being warned off the booby bird's sensitivity. As a result, when Francois takes the booby bird's picture without permission, the bird goes on the attack, causing Francois to soon be hanging from the cliff by one hand. Skye flies Cap'n Turbot in via her harness to try and save Francois, but the booby bird steps on Francois' hand, causing him to let go and fall in the water. Zuma saves him, and Cap'n Turbot is able to ask the booby bird for its picture. The bird agrees, and even poses for it. Back on the Flounder, Cap'n Turbot mentions that once he learns more of the booby bird's nature and habitat, more will migrate to Adventure Bay. Francois, traumatized by his encounter, asks that not happen, much to everyone's laughter.

Back at the Lookout, Cap'n Turbot presents a picture of the booby bird to Ryder as thanks, and when both Turbots spot Rubble on his skateboard, Rubble, in a show of good faith at not being jealous of Francois anymore, offers him a ride on it. However, Francois shows he is a very bad skateboarder, and crashes into Cap'n Turbot. In the end, the Turbots share a high-five, and everyone laughs as the story comes to an end."

The story starts at the Lookout, with Zuma and Rubble as they stare and growl each other down, before it is revealed that they are practicing for a big Pup Pup Boogie competition that's coming up. Rubble is easily matching Zuma move for move as his paws dance at a rapid pace, but when shown to perform the split, he can't recover afterwards, and is eliminated. Skye steps up next, but when performing the tailspin maneuver, she loses control and crashes, eliminating her. Marshall is next to take on Zuma.

Elsewhere, Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, and Alex are enjoying collecting pictures of sea animals for a calendar. Wally appears to hopefully get his picture taken, but Mayor Goodway and Alex spot a young, pink, Narwhal whale that would be perfect for the calendar, and set out in a rowboat to get its picture, leaving Wally upset.

Back at the Lookout, Marshall is doing a great job keeping up with Zuma, who even does a little scatting as he shows how well he's practiced. When Marshall attempts a jump maneuver, he goes too far and crashes into Rocky's wagon, spilling the old tennis balls Rocky was collecting to recycle before then crashing into Zuma. Marshall's eliminated, so Chase is next up to face Zuma.

Over at Seal Island, Cap'n Turbot is watching Mayor Goodway and Alex as they attempt to catch up to the Narwhal and get its picture. Soon however, the Narwhal dives for deep water as the skies start to turn an ominous purple, indicating a strong thunderstorm is on its way. Worrying for Mayor Goodway and Alex, Cap'n Turbot prepares to head out on the Flounder to pick them up and get them back to shore, but in his haste, he forgets his raincoat. As he heads back into the lighthouse to retrieve it, the wind blows the door shut and knocks over an oar, barricading the door shut and trapping Cap'n Turbot inside the lighthouse. Upon discovering he's trapped, Cap'n Turbot contacts Ryder to warn him.

As the other pups cheer them on, Ryder is busy playing video-games on his pup-pad and not paying attention. He soon gets Cap'n Turbot's SOS asking for help with both himself, and Mayor Goodway and Alex. Ryder complies, and calls the pups. Chase and Zuma are still battling each other, keeping up with moves and stars, when they have to postpone their rivalry on the game to respond to Ryder's summon. Marshall crashes into several of the spilled tennis balls as he attempts to enter the elevator, but somehow manages to get them all piled up back on Rocky's wagon where he was collecting them, save for one that bonks Marshall on the head and earns laughs from the other pups. Once topside, Ryder passes out orders: Zuma and Skye will join Ryder with rescuing Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, and Alex, and then they will help Cap'n Turbot. Zuma wants to finish the mission ASAP as he wants to get back to beating Chase on Pup Pup Boogie. The team deploys, but no sooner has Ryder converted his ATV to hovercraft mode, when the skies are now full of storm clouds as Adventure Bay is hit by the storm Cap'n Turbot saw developing earlier with rain pouring down hard, lightning flashing in the clouds, and the waves starting to get fierce and choppy.

Skye is having difficulties staying airborne due to the fierce storm winds, and soon has no choice but to divert to Seal Island for an emergency landing until the storm clears. Ryder understands her choice, but decides she can still help rescue Cap'n Turbot and provide lookout with him from the lighthouse.

Meanwhile, with the storm raging all around them, Mayor Goodway and Alex attempt to row back to shore. Alex only manages to row them in circles, and after Mayor Goodway is calmed by a splash of water to the face from a wave, she tries to help Alex with rowing back to shore. Unfortunately, while Alex enjoys the ride as the boat is carried along by the stormy seas, one of the oars falls overboard, causing Mayor Goodway to really become panicked. After the boat is carried away, Wally surfaces to see what's happening out of concern and curiosity and grabs the oar to return to Mayor Goodway and Alex.

Back at Seal Island, Skye makes her emergency landing, and soon removes the oar blocking Cap'n Turbot from getting out. After Cap'n Turbot thanks Skye for her help, they head to the top of the lighthouse to look for Mayor Goodway and Alex, spotting them just north of Seal Island, along with Wally as he returns the lost oar to them. Skye relays the location to Ryder and Zuma, and they head to intercept.

Back with the boat, Alex is still staying nice and calm, even commenting on the sunset, while Mayor Goodway continues to freak out. When Alex spots Ryder and Zuma approaching, Mayor Goodway finally calms down now that she knows they are about to be rescued. Zuma attempts to hook his buoy onto the front of the boat, but the strong winds from the storm cause it to fall short. Mayor Goodway attempts to retrieve it, but nearly causes either the boat to capsize, or her to fall overboard, before Wally appears to catch Mayor Goodway with his head and help with the rescue. Thanks to Wally's aid, Ryder retrieves the oar, while Wally passes Zuma's buoy to Mayor Goodway to secure the boat, and Ryder and Zuma start to tow the boat back to shore, however, with the sun going down and nighttime approaching, Ryder decides to tow the boat to Seal Island and hole up there until the storm clears. The other pups watch the rescue from the Lookout, and are relieved to see everyone safe.

Later, the storm finally clears out, and Mayor Goodway and Alex thank Ryder for saving them, Alex especially thanking Wally. Since Wally had become a hero helping with the rescue, Cap'n Turbot allows Alex to give Wally a fish as thanks for his help. Afterwards, as everyone prepares to stay the night at Cap'n Turbot's, Zuma is upset about missing his Pup Pup Boogie showdown with Chase. Cap'n Turbot however, reveals that he loves Pup Pup Boogie and brings everyone to the lighthouse, where he reveals he even has a copy of the Pup Pup Boogie game, allowing Zuma to still participate in the competition. As an added bonus, Ryder contacts Chase over at the Lookout, so they can link the games, and Zuma can still have his battle with Chase after all. The story ends as Zuma and Chase declare ""Let's Boogie!"" and everyone at the lighthouse dances out to the beat of Pup Pup Boogie.

Pups Save Ryder:

The story begins with Ryder enjoying a nice hike along Big View Trail, enjoying the view. His peace is interrupted when he hears bleating and recognizes it as Farmer Yumi's goat, Garbie. Upon investigating, Ryder discovers Garbie on a ledge several feet below the cliff, her horns trapped in some branches. Using a larger tree branch to climb down, when Ryder lets go, the branch recovers, and leaves him stranded with Garbie. Seeing that both of them need help, Ryder calls the pups.

Meanwhile, Marshall, Rubble, and Rocky are helping Mr. Porter with his produce when they get the call. Having to take a break from helping him to respond to Ryder's summon, Mr. Porter gives them each a treat for their help, and wishes them good luck.

At the Lookout, Marshall drops his biscuit, and in his attempt to retrieve it, crashes into the other pups as they enter the tower as he retreats the other way. Once Marshall retrieves his biscuit, at first the other pups glare at him, but once Marshall says he got his biscuit back, they all laugh, and he eats it as they head up. Once at the top of the tower, something is different: Ryder is not waiting for them. Ryder then contacts them on the pup-pad and reveals he needs the pups help to save him and Garbie. Before Ryder can say anymore, including where to find him and Garbie, Garbie struggles to free her horns again, fails, panics, and bucks the pup-pad right out of Ryder's hands! As the pup-pad falls down the cliff, the transmission is broken, leaving the pups concerned about how they are supposed to find Ryder now.

As for the pup-pad, it conveniently lands in the passenger seat of Mr. Porter's van as he drives past on the mountain road below on his deliveries run.

With Ryder unable to contact the pups, and the pups unable to get their orders without Ryder to command them, the pups wonder what to do. Chase steps forward as the second-in-command of the PAW Patrol to command the pups, using his skills as police pup to maintain order and calmness among the pups. Once Rocky suggests using the homing beacon in the pup-pad to try and find Ryder, Chase passes out the orders: Skye will take to the air looking for Ryder, Chase will take the ground, and Rocky will stay at the Lookout to follow the pup-pad's tracking beacon and relay its location to Skye and Chase. With that, the pups deploy, but they nearly forget about Ryder being missing when they stop to wait for Ryder to deploy on his ATV from his garage. Once Skye and Chase notice it empty, and remember that they don't need to wait for Ryder this time, they head out while the garage closes back up.

Back with Ryder and Garbie, Ryder manages to free Garbie's horns from the branches they were trapped in. Afterwards, Ryder wonders if Garbie might be able to climb back up the cliff. Garbie tries, but loses her balance, causing more of the ledge to crumble from her and Ryder's combined weight when he catches her, then Garbie licks Ryder.

Meanwhile, as Skye follows the pup-pad via Rocky's directions, Mr. Porter makes his delivery to Jake, then heads off to continue his deliveries, leaving Skye confused because of how it seems Ryder is moving all over the place. When she finally locates the pup-pad via the tracking beacon, all she sees is Mr. Porter's van. Thinking that Ryder must be with Mr. Porter, Rocky has Chase perform a police traffic stop and pull Mr. Porter over. When Mr. Porter learns of the situation, he is confused. When Chase sniffs out the pup-pad and finds it in the passenger seat, he relays the bad news to Skye and Rocky.

As Rocky starts to whimper and whine at how they might not find Ryder, he realizes they can rewind the pup-pad's travels back to where Ryder first called them. Using his screwdriver, Rocky rewinds the footage, and finds that Ryder called them from Big View Trail. Skye is soon there, and spots Ryder and Garbie, but upon seeing more of the ledge crumble, relays for more backup. Marshall and Rubble respond, and once Rubble clears the rocks away, Marshall attempts to reach Ryder with his ladder. But, the ladder is just short of reaching Ryder. Luckily, Skye flies in with Ryder's harness and has him climb into it. Garbie leaps into Ryder's arms, and Skye carries them both to safety just in time as the ledge crumbles away even more, leaving no room to stand on it anymore. As Chase, Marshall, and Rubble cheer from the road, Skye carries Ryder and Garbie back to the Lookout.

When Skye arrives home to the Lookout and drops Ryder off, Zuma and Rocky run over to embrace Ryder by licking him, Zuma just smiling. They are both happy Ryder is safe. Skye joins them just after that to embrace Ryder as well. Chase, Marshall, and Rubble soon follow after with Chase licking Ryder, and then Mr. Porter arrives offering a snack of watermelon for everyone. Before Ryder can eat his piece, Garbie devours it. Ryder can only guess that Garbie must be really hungry from being on the ledge for so long, and Garbie makes it clear as she eats the pups' slices of watermelon as well. Mr. Porter assures he still has plenty of watermelon to go around, and when Ryder mentions that Garbie will eat just about anything, he is horrified to see Garbie crush the pup-pad in her mouth, then swallow it whole after chewing on it. Luckily, the pups provide a spare pup-pad for Ryder, and remind him of the PAW Patrol motto: ""Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!""

The story ends as everyone laughs over how the pups are ready for just about anything, including if the pup-pad is destroyed by an unintentional accident."

Ryder and the pups are finishing preparations for the Great Race, including anchoring Mayor Goodway's balloon so she has a bird's eye view and can call the race from above. An argument between the pups about who will win, including Skye mentioning she is competing fair and square and not taking any shortcuts, is interrupted as Ryder calls the PAW Patrol to the Lookout. Following the pups trying to enter the elevator at once, and Marshall being flung into the elevator while the others fly backward, leading to Marshall announcing he won the race into the elevator, the pups learn that Ryder has called them to give them a final rundown of the race course. With that, the PAW Patrol deploy and head to the starting line.

The race is about to start when Alex pulls up to participate as well on his super-trike. Rubble at first says he can't do so, but Ryder agrees to allow Alex to participate since the race is in good fun. With Mayor Goodway giving the command, the pups and Alex take off.

A few lead changes between Zuma, Chase, and Marshall result in several of the pups being covered in watermelon as they pass Mr. Porter's restaurant. As the pups and Alex leave Adventure Bay's streets and head for Jake's Mountain, trouble appears when Jake unintentionally moves some of the cones Chase laid down to let some snowboarders through, leading to the pups and Alex taking a slight detour down the ski slopes. The pups and Alex soon return to Adventure Bay and make the next leg around the Lookout to return to the starting line. Along the way, Marshall gets turned around by the other pups, and nearly ends up going the other way (but he soon turns back around), and an incident at Katie's Pet Parlor with Katie and Cali leads to the pups being spun out by a wall of soap and bubbles, while Alex is unharmed due to his slower speed.

During the race, Mayor Goodway offered Chickaletta a corn cob to munch on, but Chickaletta's poking and prodding causes the cob to fall out of both Mayor Goodway's purse and the balloon itself. Upset at losing her meal, or out of curiosity, Chickaletta pokes away at the anchoring rope of the balloon, fraying it until it snaps and the balloon rises into the air.

Ryder notices when he hears Mayor Goodway's cries for help, and calls the pups to assist with recovering Mayor Goodway and her balloon, having Skye airlift Ryder to the balloon, while the others rendezvous at the soccer field. With the pups dealing with the emergency that just occurred, Alex finds himself heading to the finish line in the lead with no-one else around.

Once Skye gets Ryder to the balloon, Ryder cuts off the flame so the balloon descends, and the other pups take two new anchor ropes and secure the balloon safely on the ground. Mayor Goodway is grateful to the pups, but Chickaletta has fallen asleep despite it being her fault this happened. With Mayor Goodway now safe, Ryder reminds the pups that they still have a race to finish, and Alex is almost to the finish line.

Despite getting back in the race as quickly as they could, Chase is the closest to Alex, with Zuma right behind. The race to the finish begins, ending in a photo finish between Chase and Alex. When Ryder reviews the picture, Alex crossed the finish first, making him the winner. Despite that, Ryder knows the pups are all winners for helping save Mayor Goodway, as the citizens cheer for Alex and the PAW Patrol.

Pups Take the Cake:

The story begins with Mayor Goodway, Mr. Porter, Ryder, and the pups watching a video of last year's Tallest and Tastiest Cake Competition, which was won by Mayor Goodway's arch-rival, Mayor Humdinger of Foggy Bottom. This year, Mr. Porter is representing Adventure Bay in the competition, but when he hears that his entry has to be at City Hall by lunchtime, Mr. Porter races back to his restaurant in a panic at what little time he has to get the cake done. Marshall and Rubble offer to help and lick the bowl afterwards, but Mr. Porter is too busy now to give them that chance as he is busy enough getting all the cakes baked and building the cake one brick at a time. It turns out Mr. Porter's cake for the competition is one styled after the PAW Patrol's Lookout tower. They need 1,000 cake bricks, but Alex, despite his attempts to help his grandfather, has only made three, due to being distracted by his toy cars and racetrack.

Suddenly, Marshall smells smoke, and Mr. Porter realizes his cakes are burning. Marshall attempts to extinguish the blaze, but only soaks Mr. Porter, who holds the trays of his two burnt cakes and realizes this puts him severely behind as he now has to re-bake the burnt cakes and needs more ingredients. Seeing Mr. Porter needs help, Marshall and Rubble suggest calling Ryder and the other pups for assistance. Mr. Porter does so, and Ryder summons the pups to the Lookout. Marshall is still holding the carton of eggs he was given in his mouth, and ends up having the eggs fall out and into his mouth, forcing him to unintentionally spit them into the elevator and splatter them over the elevator walls and the other pups.

For once, none of the pups laugh at Marshall's goof-up, and only groan at his egg-related joke about his accident. Once in the tower, Ryder gives the pups their orders, and the pups deploy to help Mr. Porter. When they arrive, they get right to work. Despite Marshall accidentally covering Mr. Porter in cake batter, with the pups' help, the cake is baked and finished, but Mr. Porter is delayed again when Rubble trips on Alex's toy cars and spills the icing on Marshall. Alex apologizes for not cleaning up his toys, but his grandfather is not angry with him, knowing it was an accident. However, Mr. Porter is still upset that they must make more frosting, but when Ryder tells him it will be finished in time if they all work together, then Mr. Porter and Alex both cheer up.

With the pups and Alex's help, the Lookout cake is still iced and fully completed in time to be delivered to the City Hall, but Marshall realizes it doesn't have a slide. With time critical, they have to go without one, but due to the cake being top-heavy, the PAW Patrol are pressed with finding a way to stabilize it so it doesn't fall over. Alex offers his toy cars' racetrack as a means to help, and with the track, the cake now has a slide and is stable.

Meanwhile, during the contest, Cap'n Turbot has made a fish cake (made out of real fish), much to the disgust of the judge, but the pleasure of Cali. The judge then tastes Mayor Humdinger's balloon cake, and Mayor Humdinger is sure that his cake will win as before.

With Chase providing police escort in front, and Rocky carrying the cake on his truck's forklift, they barely make it to City Hall before the buzzer sounds, ending submissions to the contest, much to Mayor Humdinger's annoyance that Adventure Bay still got an entry in at the last second.

As everyone waits to see the judge's decision, he measures Mr. Porter's cake to be taller than Mayor Humdinger's and, upon tasting it, also declares it the tastiest, and thus the winner, much to Mayor Humdinger's shock. Mayor Goodway and the others are proud of Mr. Porter and Alex, who thank Ryder and the PAW Patrol for their help. Mr. Porter then decides that now all that is left is for the pups to enjoy his cake, since they did another great job.

While the pups enjoy their cake, Cali develops a tummy-ache from eating too much of Cap'n Turbot's fish cake. Marshall gives the PAW Patrol a good laugh to end the story when he accidentally bumps the table the Lookout cake is on, and the top of the cake falls off on his head, leaving him to eat out the part in front of his face, and Ryder to joke that Marshall really takes the cake."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3461732/?ref_=ttep_ep26,,"Cap'n Turbot accidentally stumbles into a secret cavern that was once a pirate's hideout. When the PAW Patrol rescues him, they find an incomplete treasure map. The adventure is on as the pups follow clues to find the missing map pieces, and eventually to a sunken pirate treasure!",[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"The story opens with Cap'n Turbot attempting to get some pictures of the blue-footed booby bird again, this time with its eggs. He is just about to take the first photo, when the booby bird attacks him in defense of its eggs. As Cap'n Turbot steps backward trying to explain himself, he falls down a hole, and ends up stuck in a barrel in a cave underneath. After pulling himself out, and finding the beach crab clamped onto his behind, Cap'n Turbot finds a chest, along with a black flag sporting the all-too familiar Jolly Roger skull-and-crossbones. Cap'n Turbot immediately suspects that the cave was a hideout for the legendary Adventure Bay pirate, Captain Blackfur. With him pretty much stuck, Cap'n Turbot calls Ryder for help.

At the Lookout, Ryder is playing basketball with Marshall, Chase, Rubble, and Zuma. Marshall is having a lot of trouble making a basket, as every time he misses, he hits Rubble afterward. After it happens again, the pups head off to find a means to help Marshall out, while Ryder gets Cap'n Turbot's call for help and his hypothesis that he may have stumbled onto Captain Blackfur's hideout. Excited to find some more evidence to Captain Blackfur's existence, Ryder contacts the pups and has them report to the Lookout. Marshall and the others have chosen Rocky's catapult to help Marshall with making a basket, but Ryder's summon causes Marshall to fall on the catapult after the basketball is launched, and the ball activates the catapult, sending Marshall flying into the elevator ahead of the other pups. After Skye reprimands Marshall about how she's the flying pup, and he is more than happy to accept that, the pups report upstairs, and are excited at how they might be hunting for pirate treasure, especially Rubble. Ryder picks Chase and Rubble to assist with helping Cap'n Turbot, and the team heads out to where they last knew of Cap'n Turbot's whereabouts.

When the PAW Patrol arrive, Cap'n Turbot gets their attention, and Chase uses his winch to lower Ryder down into the cave so Cap'n Turbot can show him the pirate paraphernalia he found. Afterward, Ryder has Rubble and Chase come down to join him, even though Rubble is suffering another panic attack from his arachnophobia, since caves are one place where spiders live. After Rubble gets spooked by one, Chase joins them, and Ryder has Rubble try on an old pirate hat that fits Rubble perfectly. Afterward, Chase finds another opening that is blocked by a large rock and a pile of smaller ones. He can smell seawater from outside, and it is not long before Rubble manages to clear away the smaller rocks so they can get to the larger one. Chase then hears distant waves crashing, and Ryder decides to call in Zuma to check to see where they are going to emerge. Luckily, Zuma arrives to point out that the others will emerge on the North Shore Beach, and together, Ryder, Rubble, Chase, and Cap'n Turbot are able to push the large rock aside and get out. Soon, they find a message in a bottle, and realize it is part of a treasure map from Captain Blackfur. Ryder calls Marshall, Skye, and Rocky back at the Lookout, and has them meet up with the others. When they arrive, Ryder reveals the map, but points out that there is no ""X"" marking where the treasure is. However, he does find a cryptic message from Captain Blackfur, saying that he broke the map into three pieces, and they can find the second piece in the mouth of the rock outcropping shaped like a parrot's beak.

The team sets off to find it, while Cap'n Turbot stays behind, disappointed over how the pups get all the excitement and fun out of missions. Skye soon gets to the location first, but finds a little bunny rabbit sleeping on a rock. Soon, the mama eagle appears overhead, and fearing that the little rabbit will be the Mama eagle's next meal, Skye takes flight with her pup-pack to lure the Mama eagle away, giving the rabbit time to wake up, realize the danger, and hop to safety. As for Skye, she is soon in a dogfight with the Mama eagle, but finally manages to lose her, just as the rest of the PAW Patrol arrive. Once they regroup, they soon see the bottle right where the map piece said it would be, and Skye retrieves it. Afterward, Rocky tapes the two pieces together, and the clue from Captain Blackfur on the second piece says that the third piece is located in a knothole of the largest tree in Adventure Bay. Chase realizes that the trees where his owl friend, Little Hootie, lives are full of knotholes, so the last piece must be in one of them. The team immediate set out for the forest where Little Hootie lives, though Rubble nearly gets left behind when he starts acting like a pirate again and does not notice the others leave until a moment or two later.

Skye, Zuma, Rocky, and Rubble are the first to get there, but Rubble's first attempt within a large tree trunk due to his bravado only gets him a spider on his nose that Rocky removes with a shovel from his pup-pack and puts back, revealing that a whole family of spiders lives in the hollow trunk, much to Rubble's disgust and paranoia. Skye's attempt only sends her reeling, pup-pack first, backward against another tree from a sneeze induced by the dust in the knothole she checked. Soon, Ryder, Marshall, and Chase arrive, and Little Hooty comes down to see what's happening. Chase asks Little Hootie if he's seen a bottle in any of the knotholes, and Little Hootie flies over to the knothole where the bottle is located. Marshall drives over to retrieve it with his ladder, but loses his balance and nearly lets the bottle smash on the ground. Luckily, Ryder catches him, and Marshall catches the bottle in his fireman's helmet. After thanking Little Hootie for his help, Ryder has Rocky tape the third piece to the other two, completing the map, and find the ""X"" that marks the spot.

According to Captain Blackfur's instructions, one has to walk 20 paces from where they found the last piece of the map, but Ryder only gets about halfway before he discovers if he went any further, he'd fall into the ocean. Ryder thinks that the map was wrong. However, Marshall takes tiny steps which are consistent with the map's instructions, yet he nearly sends Ryder over the cliff because he was counting too fast. That's when the PAW Patrol spot something anchored on a small island just a short distance from the cliff, but obscured by an eerie, green fog. When Skye flies over to investigate, she discovers it to be Captain Blackfur's old pirate ship. Age has really done a number on the old vessel, as it looks like it is ready to fall apart when the tide changes. Knowing they can't let that happen, the PAW Patrol set out to save the old ship.

While Skye attaches a mooring line to the mainmast, Rubble digs out a channel to bring the ship to the mainland, and Chase has his winch attached to the front of the ship to help Skye pull it in from the small island it's on. Ryder and Zuma overlook the rescue effort from their vehicles, and at first, things seem to be going fine. That is, until the ship's anchor chain goes taut, indicating the anchor must be stuck on something underwater. Ryder and Zuma head down, and find the anchor is indeed stuck between a pair of rocks. When the anchor won't budge upon trying to free it, Zuma kicks his pup-pack's scuba engines into overdrive to provide him the thrust to push one of the rocks out of the way, freeing the anchor, and allowing the ship to resume being pulled to shore. As the other pups cheer, Ryder and Zuma surface to notice a rope ladder dangling off one side of the ship's stern, and decide to climb aboard for a ride.

It is soon sunset, and Cap'n Turbot, Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, Mayor Goodway's niece and nephew, and several citizens are waiting when the PAW Patrol arrive with Captain Blackfur's ship safely intact. After Mayor Goodway makes a short speech about the PAW Patrol saving a valuable piece of Adventure Bay's history, Ryder invites Cap'n Turbot aboard via Marshall's ladder to help with hauling Blackfur's treasure up from the cargo hold. Once they have it topside, Rocky provides a key to undo the chest's lock, and upon opening it, Ryder, the pups, and Turbot, are amazed by all the gold doubloons, gems, and other treasures inside, such as golden dog bones, and a golden, jewel-encrusted dog bowl. At first, they think that Blackfur had a faithful pirate pup, until they find a portrait of the legendary pirate himself, and discover that Blackfur was a pirate pup. Even more interesting, he looks to be a distant ancestor to Rubble, due to the similar appearance between them, save for Blackfur's trademark black fur beard. Blackfur also left a message requesting what to do with his treasure once it was found. According to his last requests, once his treasure was found, Blackfur wanted it to be returned to the good people of Adventure Bay.

With that, the story ends with a pirate-themed version of the PAW Patrol ending theme, as the pups enjoy playing around Blackfur's ship, and Marshall landing next to Rubble, who now sports a black fur beard just like Blackfur, leaving both to laugh as the story irises out with a skull-and-crossbones iris out to go with the pirate theme of the story."

He finds himself face to face to Rabbit. Rabbit promises him that every day in this prison he will know pain. Several inmates begin beating on him. It all gets worse when the albino arrives. He beats, cuts, and stabs the prisoner and leaves him unconscious and bleeding on the floor. The Albino has been given the job of making sure that the prisoner's time in prison is painful.

Ex con Leonard Vanderwyck (Wicks) arrives in Banshee by bus. By chance, he sees Sheriff Hood and recognizes him as a former prison mate. He is arrested for shoplifting. He asks to see Hood. It seems that after the beating that Hood took in prison, Wicks was his prison orderly. He helped him get healthy. He brought him food and told him the ins and outs of the prison. Lucas helps Wicks out by giving him some money and setting him up in a hotel for a little while. He puts him on a bus, gives him some money, and sends him out of town and tells him to not come back.

Lucas continues to remember the time he spent in prison. After he healed and was released to general population, he goes to see the Albino to make a deal. Rebuffed, he takes it out on the Albino's favorite prison boy toy. He ends up in solitary confinement where he works on getting stronger so he can fight and defend himself against the Albino when he gets out of solitary.

Proctor is up to his old shenanigans. Proctor blackmails the town preacher with pictures of his wife having sex with Proctor himself. He needs the preacher's land for his new casino. The preacher doesn't want to sell. However, when the option is sell or have pictures and a video tape of your wife vigorously having sex with Proctor emailed to every member of your church, he acquiesces.

Even though Hood told him to stay away, Wicks comes back to Banshee anyway. He gambles the money that Hood gave him away at the casino. He starts a fight and gets arrested again. Lucas has to help him again. It is obvious that Wicks is not going to let this go. Sugar tells Lucas a story about men like Wicks. They are always dangerous because they pull everyone around them down. Lucas realizes that he needs to deal with Wicks one last time.

Remembering his time in prison again, Lucas recounts the time that the Albino had him on his knees and made him ask to perform fellatio. He also remembers the ensuing fight between the two and the outcome of that fight. Lucas is a man that does whatever he needs to survive and stay safe.

Lucas kills the Albino. Lucas kills Wicks."

At the Dingle home, Sam writes his daughter, a schoolteacher, a note saying he is going to visit the claim. Tonto goes with him while the Lone Ranger goes to town to register the claim.

A male voiceover talks about finding ""that one person"" and wonders what happens when that person is taken away.

We see a gang leader of some kind walking through a subway car with his boys. He spots a disheveled homeless man and takes his bottle of booze. When he makes another move, the man quickly turns the tables and beats up all of them with minimal effort.

All the players from the subway incident end up at the police station. The homeless man speaks with a police officer named Carter. She asks about his background, assuming he is former military based on his fighting prowess. An attorney arrives and is able to make sure the homeless man is released. As soon as he leaves, another cop tells Carter the homeless guy's fingerprints match those found at the scene of several crime scenes in various parts of the world.

Outside the station, two men tell the homeless guy their employer would like to speak with him.

The homeless man (Reese) is brought to meet with a man calling himself Mr. Finch. Finch knows Reese used to work for the government and has been having doubts about what he's done. He knows Reese is suicidal and thinks what Reese needs is a purpose.

Finch and Reese stands on a busy New York City block and asks what he would do if he was able to stop crimes before they happen. Finch has ""a list"" of people about to be involved in terrible things -- murders, kidnappings -- either as victim or perpetrator. Once such woman is Diane Hanson. Finch knows he's involved and wants Reese to get involved and stop it from happening. Reese isn't interested.

We see Reese in a hotel room watching a news report about himself. He then drinks himself into unconsciousness and briefly dreams about Jessica, the woman he was with in the flashback. The phone rings. It is Finch, telling him what he needs is to know what it feels like to let somebody be killed when you could have helped. Reese's hand is tied to the bed and he hears the sound of someone being hurt across the hall. He bursts into the room only to find Finch sitting next to a recording. The recording was three years old, from when a woman was murdered for insurance. Finch says something about Reese being halfway across the world when Jessica was killed. Finch says unlike the government ,he'll never lie to Reese. Finch says he's offering the chance to be there for people the way he couldn't be for Jessica.

Finch takes Reese to his remote base of operation. Finch references how little Reese knows about him and says that isn't likely to change. We see Finch has been getting social security numbers of these persons of interest. He won't tell Reese how.

The woman in question is Diane Hanson, a highly successful assistant district attorney. Reese breaks into her home and grabs as much information as he can. He hacks her cell phone and points a wireless camera at her apartment.

Reese has narrowed the list of likely suspect to two: Wheeler, a former boyfriend and co-counselor and Pope, the man she's currently prosecuting for a gang-related murder. Reese thinks Pope's gang could be targeting her.

Hanson has a dispute with a detective witness when he strays from the testimony they had talked about. She meets with Pope alone and tells him she doesn't think he murdered the people. She asks if he is protecting somebody. He tells her ""these people"" are evil and she should leave it alone. Pope ends up grabbing her by the throat and warning her not to do anything. Reese thinks the people who framed Pope will be coming after Hanson and thinks Pope's brother Michael is the only person who will know who they are.

In another Reese flashback, he tells his woman he's already quit the service. They turn on the TV and see the planes crashing into the World Trace Center on 9/11.

Reese sees Wheeler find information about Michael.

Reese finds Michael, who runs away from him. Michael gets away, but not before Reese is able to plant his cell phone in Michael's backpack.

Reese pays a visit to his gang leader buddy from the opening, Anton O'Mara, when he goes to buy guns. Reese shoots everybody in the room (other than Anton) in the leg and takes the guns.

Michael is grabbed by guys threatening to kill him gang-style. Reese uses his newfound arsenal to take out the car and the guys. We see the men were cops.

Reese shows Finch they are up against dirty narcotics cops, who steal money and drugs and frame people like Pope for their crime. Finch tells him after 9/11, he helped the government design a secret system to eavesdrop on U.S. citizens. He ""taught"" it to separate information related to possible terrorism from other potential crime. But he built himself a backdoor to get at the rest of the information and all he is able to get is the social security number of the central figure. If the government were to ever learn he still has this access, he'll be shut out.

Carter learns ""a suit"" took out Anton's entire gang by himself.

Pope is stabbed to death in his cell. Hanson is called for a meeting in an out-of-the-way alley. Reese follows her and sees Hanson is actually in cahoots with the dirty cops, who are led by an officer Stills. Reese is captured while watching the meeting. Hanson tells them to take care of Reese and then do the same to Wheeler. She admits she was behind the killing of Pope.

Reese wakes up in the car driven by Fusco, who was on the stand earlier. He tells the Fusco he thinks that unlike Stills, he's only participating in these crimes out of loyalty. Reese says that is why he is going to let him live and they both laugh. Reese is going to be sticking around New York for a while and he wants to have a guy on the inside. Reese then sets off an explosive in the back of the car which flips it over. Reese gets out pulls the unconscious Fusco out of the car. After asking if he is wearing a vest, Reese shoots him three times in the back.

Reese tells Finch about Hanson being the ringleader.

Cut to Stills and one of his buddies at Wheeler's place. They are planning to kill Wheeler and frame an ex-con who they pull out of the trunk. Wheeler is with his kid but that doesn't seem to deter Stills's plan. Reese gets the jump on one of Stills's accomplices and puts a gun to his head. Wheeler and his young son get off the elevator. Stills allows them to leave. Reese wounds another of Stills's henchmen and appears to kill Stills, allowing the ex-con to leave.

Reese manages to have a recording of Hanson revealing her guilt played in open court.

Reese pops into Fusco's car and tells him nobody knows he is involved. Also he tells him Stills is in the trunk. He shot him with Fusco's gun. Reese instructs him to dump Stills's body in a remote body of water and says ""I'll be in touch.""

Finch tells Reese he has a decision to make. He say ""the world thinks we're both dead"" and ""you're not the only one whose lost someone."" He tells Reese if he stays, they will both end up dead eventually.

Carter busts one of Stills's guys who again references a guy in a suit being responsible. Reese -- who was watching this -- disappears into the crowd."

Joey works as a doorman.

Reese watches Joey at work and sees him get a garbled text message. He leaves work early and heads to a bank, with Reese following. Joey puts on a mask as three other gun-toting men join him to rob the bank. While on the ground Reese stops an older security guard from going for his gun.

We flashback to 2006. Reese is back from the war and runs into Jessica.

Finch wants to give Joey to the cops. Reese wants to have the chance to look into it. Reese sees Joey give a woman a large sum of cash. Reese spots Joey getting out of a cab driven by what turns out to be another marine from his unit, a man named Willis.

Finch finds out Willis had just been at a bar owned by a former military man named Latimer. This appears to be the ringleader. Reese asks Finch to get him a backstory so he can meet Latimer and to eventually create an opening in the team.

At the bar Reese gives Latimer a story of hearing about him from a marine who was killed in action. Latimer doesn't seem sure and tells Reese there are no jobs available right now.

Finch plants a bunch of weapons in Willis's cab and has him arrested.

A cop from the robbery department tells Carter about finding Reese's fingerprints at the scene of the bank job. He shows her footage of the robbery, where they notice both that Reese helped the security guard and that the robbers are ex-military.

With Willis out of commission Latimer calls Reese and has him meet the team. They toss him in a van and drive him to a remote location. When they decide he's okay they give him a phone and tell him to wait for their call.

Reese doesn't think Joey is a cold-blooded killer, so the machine must think he's going to be a victim.

Joey meets his girlfriend at her job waiting tables. Clearly they're having some trouble in the relationship.

This flashes Reese back again to the meeting with Jessica. He implies he has a new job he can't talk about and she tells him she's engaged to a man named Peter and is moving back east. She says she waited for him and he says he never asked her to. Jessica thinks he thought it would be easier being alone.

Carter looks into the gang robbing all the banks. They've done a dozen jobs and haven't hurt a single person. She spots that they are using military-issue radios for communication. The radios were stolen six months ago. Carter wants the robbery cop to cross-check New York area serviceman who left out of the same base over the past year.

Reese sees Joey watch the woman from earlier pick up a kid from kindergarten.

Reese makes a point to ""accidentally"" run into Joey at a bar. They talk about the service and the economy. They have a run-in with two bankers that results in Reese head-butting one of them in the face and punching the other.

Outside Joey tells Reese that he had an ""obligation"" to pay and his normal job wasn't cutting it. He says one of the other guys, Straub, has a gambling problem.

Finch finds out the woman Joey's been seeing is an Amy Miles. Reese checks out Straub and sees him meet with Latimer. Straub wants more money and Latimer tells him about a huge upcoming job. Latimer references several soldiers who used to work for him that have since retired. Straub asks what happens to their split if one of them gets killed.

The robbery cop found one of the robbers, a man named Teddy. Carter wants him followed quickly.

Reese gets called for the next job, busting an illegal casino. The team is heavily armed. Carter is watching. Once they break in and start grabbing cash, Carter calls for back-up. Finch hears this and tells Reese. Reese tells the team his has the police band in his ear and helps them get out just in time.

Latimer tells Straub the next job is the ""big one,"" and makes reference to the new guy not being needed on the way out.

Finch thinks they have to wrap this up before somebody gets killed. Reese wants to talk to Joey before they do anything. Finch has been putting money into a savings account for the little girl. It turns out the father of the little girl, Frank, was in Joey's unit and was killed in Afghanistan.

Joey tells Reese about an upcoming meeting. Reese tells him he thinks Straub is dangerous. Joey says Frank took his place on patrol while he was babysitting a politician and got killed. Reese asks him not to do the next job.

Reese sits in Joey's girlfriend's section and tells her how crazy he is about her. She waited six years for him to come home and ""it's like he's still over there."" She indicates that she's in love with Joey and Reese tells Finch they should tip the cops to the next job.

Carter finds out the two solider we saw Latimer referencing to Straub as having ""retired"" were really shot in the head. It seems Latimer kills the guys after four or five jobs and brings in new meat.

The team is told it is stealing one small item from an evidence lock-up that is worth $400,000. Finch listens to Latimer tells someone that he is killing the team. Straub says they've been given brand new weapons. The team destroys all of their cell phones, meaning Finch can't tell Reese what is about to happen.

The job begins and Finch has placed himself right in the middle of the operation. He's able to whisper to Reese that the job is a trap. One of the cops hasn't been secured and grabs a gun. Reese finally convinces them to leave but they take fire on the way out.

The incident is called in and Carter hears that is probably their team.

Latimer is waiting for the team in the van when they return. He kills Straub and Teddy. Joey realizes the weapons they were given don't work. Reese and Joey flee the scene just as the cops arrive.

Reese gives Joey some cash and tells him to get out of the city. He tells him to ask his girlfriend to go with him.

Carter talks to Reese on the radio she found on one of the bodies. She says sooner or later she's going to lock him up.

Latimer gives an unseen person the item they team stole, which was from an evidence box with Elias written on it.

Reese finds Latimer dead and tells Finch they need to look into the name Elias.

Joey and his girlfriend get on a bus.

Another flashback to Reese and Jessica five years ago. She asks him if he wants to take a risk. If he tells her to wait for him, she will. He says nothing and she walks away. He mutters ""Wait for me. Please,"" after she's out of earshot."

She looks at his x-ray and figures out that he's had spinal fusion surgery in the last year or so. He just wants pain meds and she gives them to him. While she's turned away he switches out her beepers.

Finch tells Reese that Tillman is the latest number to be spat out of the computer. She's a talented, hard-working doctor who lives alone. She's well liked and has had no complaints from patients. Reese thinks they'll have to watch her around the clock to figure out why she's on their radar.

Tillman goes to a club and Reese spots a man who bumped into her earlier. He makes a point to bump into him and grabs his wallet. The guy's name is Andrew Benton and he's carrying roofies.

It turns out that Tillman's been at the club every night that week, so she's living a double life of some sort. Benton is an investment banker with a history of accusations that make him sound like a potential sexual predator.

Reese breaks into Benton's place and copies his laptop.

Carter has figured out based on video of the robbery last week that Reese and Finch (who she has found under his other name) communicated.

Finch finds that Benton has an expunged college record. He doesn't like Reese's relationship with Fusco.

A drug dealer pays Fusco a visit looking for money that is still owed him.

Tillman's back at the bar the next night. Tillman and Benton hit it off at the bar, though she gives him a false name. He invites her back to his place but she passes.

Reese follows Tillman, who appears to be taking pictures of Benton with a telephoto lens. She's stalking him.

Fusco tells Reese about being harassed by the drug dealer.

Benton was accused of giving a woman the date rape drug in college. He got off in part because she waited two days to report the attack. The young woman was Tillman's sister who subsequently committed suicide.

Carter pays Finch a visit about the robbery he witnessed. She confronts him about it looking as if Reese spoke to him. He says the man told him to stop staring at him and he begged for his life.

Finch tells Reese he thinks Carter will catch up with him soon.

Reese follows Tillman to a support group. He talks to her at the coffee machine and tells her he lost someone close to him. She tells him a story about running into Benton and when he introduces himself as ""John,"" she responds with the alias ""Kate Leman.""

Reese seems to have figured out Benton's pattern of rape.

Following the alias Tillman's been using, Reese tracks down a home and finds it filled with materials she could use to dispose of Benton's body. Reese is worried Benton's too savvy for her and plans to get rid of him.

Reese helps Fusco take down the drug dealers who have been pressuring him. He beats them up and takes their drugs as Fusco watches in amazement and fear at what they will do to him.

Reese stops Benton's car and knocks him out. He wrecks the guys' car in front of the station and fills the car with drugs.

Shockingly Benton is released the following day. Fusco says it's because of his high-profile legal team.

Tillman's listens to what sounds like a suicide voicemail left by her sister.

Finch spots Tillman heading towards Benton's loft and alerts Reese. At the same moment Reese is knocked out by the drug dealers.

Tillman hits Benton with a stun gun and ties him up.

Fusco helped the drug dealers to find Reese. They begin baiting Reese.

Tillman puts Benton's body in a van.

As Fusco again watches mouth agape in amazement, Reese deftly extricates himself and disposes of all the drug dealers without bothering to remove the manacles from his wrists. Fusco apologizes and Reese tells him it's time for a change of scenery, dirty cop wise, then admonishes him: ""Lionel, don't do this again!""

Reese makes a point to run into Tillman. He calls her by her real name and references knowing she has a guy tied up the back. He tells her she's a great doctor but she'll never get away with killing Benton. Reese thinks killing Benton will kill her. He says she ""doesn't have to do this"" and asks for her keys. She gives him the keys.

Behind the wheel of the van Reese tells Finch that he and Benton are going to ""have a little talk."" Finch says he's taken care of the Carter problem. Fusco has been transferred to Carter's team.

Reese sits across from Benton with a gun on the table. He asks whether Benton thinks that people ever really change. Reese says he could let him go, since Benton would always be looking over his shoulder. But then he says that people don't really change.

He invites Benton to help him make a good decision about whether to kill him or not as the episode ends...."

Reese drops in on Finch who is eating at a diner. He asks if Finch has a favorite menu item and Finch thinks he's fishing for personal information. He leaves behind a photo of the latest number, judge Samuel Gates who lives with his son after his wife passed away less than a year ago. There is also a nanny, Christina (Adriana Gaviria), who spends a lot of time with son Sam.

Reese begins watching Gates (David Costabile) and through placing hidden bugs learns that the jurist has had numerous death threats. While following Gates, Reese notices a man with a crew cut behind him drop a cell phone in the trash which Reese retrieves. The phone recently sent a text that ""School's out, moving in"" and Reese guesses correctly that the father may not be the target.

Young Sam is abducted from the family's home. Reese shows up at the last minute and attempts to stop the kidnapping, but is unable to keep Sam from being taken as he is hit with a small caliber bullet in the shoulder.

Gates gets a call from the kidnappers who tell him his son is alive but they will kill him if contacts the police. Gates makes a few calls and realizes that Sam is missing. Reese shows and promises Gates that he will help get his son back.

Reese goes with Gates to his home. The housekeeper is missing and the alarm was bypassed. He doesn't think Christina could be in on it.

Finch is looking into the discarded cell phone and is attempting to hack the cell phone company to get more info. Reese discovers that the nanny was killed, probably in order to get the alarm code. He dials 911 and leaves the phone off the hook so NYPD can trace the call back to its physical location.

Detective Carter isn't sure about the newly reassigned Fusco.

Reese calls Fusco away for a brief meeting on the street. Fusco tells Reese that Carter won't quit until she finds him. Reese asks him to look at the ballistics, and anything related to guys with crew cuts.

Finch finally gets some information from the discarded cell phone. Reese goes to the location and knocks out a crew-cutted thug named Josef. Based on tattoos he knows the guy is with an Eastern European street gang.

Carter gets called to the scene of Christina's death. A neighbor spotted someone whose description could be Reese, leaving that apartment.

A cop goes to Gates's home to tell him about Christina. He lies and says Sam is fine. Reese tells Gates about the gang. Gates is suspicious about exactly who Reese is, but he reassures the judge he can help him more than the police. The gang calls and tells Gates that don't want money, rather they need him to ensure a defendant, Angela Markham, the hit-and-run driver we saw earlier, is found Not Guilty and released.

Before the trial resumes Gates tells Reese that Markham was charged with DWI. Reese tells him that the gang is going to kill him, too, so he needs to buy Reese time to find Sam.

Finch has learned that the gang is essentially a multi-national corporation. They're smart and haven't been leaving much of a footprint anywhere.

Fusco tells Reese that his bullet isn't in the system, but offers to help him ID Christina's killer. Fusco helps Carter with the Christina case and she's happy for the assistance.

After driving around in circles with the gang member in his trunk, the thug tells Reese that he doesn't know anything about the kid. They work in small cells and he doesn't have that kind of access. He does, however, give up the address of where he goes to get paid.

Gates starts sustaining every defense objection. He then tells the prosecutor to take time and get her witness prepared and adjourns until the following day. In chambers he gets a call from the gang who thinks he is stalling. Gates says he needs to make it look good so the verdict won't be overturned on appeal.

Finch overhears Markham (Meredith Patterson) talking to the gang leader and learns that her connection to the gang is business-related.

Reese goes to the money house. He grabs yet another gang member, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in small bills.

The gang leader is furious when he finds out what is happening and starts barking orders.

Finch has figured out that Markham is in charge of the money-laundering system at a large bank which is cleaning all of the gang's cash. Finch thinks if they can find the gang's specific accounts they'll be able to find Sam.

Reese asks Gates to give him a little more time. Gates goes onto the bench and throws out a critical piece of evidence.

Finch is able to get inside the bank and access some of its computer files.

Fusco spots a guy on the street near Christina's place who could be the killer. He calls it ""a hunch"" and has a plate run back to a Coldfield Holdings in Brooklyn.

Reese has obtained from his gang prisoner the identity of the boss, a man named Jarek Koska. Finch tells Reese that every day Markham shuts down the anti-laundering software for five minutes, during which time the gang scrubs millions of dollars. Not only are they laundering their own money, but they are providing the service for other criminal organizations. Fusco texts Reese the name Coldfield, which he gives to Finch. It turns up a huge account, along with an address that is less than ten blocks from Gates's house.

As the jury returns with a verdict, Reese finds that Sam has been moved from the location. Markham is found not guilty.

Jarek calls Gates and tells him they need to meet to hand over Sam. Finch is listening and realizes that Gates and his son will be killed at the meet.

At the location Jarek is preparing to shoot Sam when Reese shows up with a gun to Markham's head. He then tells Jarek that all of his accounts have been emptied and the money moved to an offshore account. If Jarek doesn't let them all go free he will inform the other criminal enterprises that he's lost their money as well and they will surely kill him. This sort of works, as Jarek pushes Sam away, then gives his men the order to ""kill everyone."" In the ensuing shootout Reese kills Jarek's henchman and wounds him, but Gates and Sam are fine.

We see that Finch has surreptitiously slipped a piece of paper with Markham's financial misdeeds to the lead prosecutor.

Carter and Fusco arrive at the address associated with Coldfield Holdings to find Jarek, Markham and several other gang members tied up next to the cash.

Reese pays Gates and his son a visit. Gates thanks him, but assures him he won't be able to help him when he's eventually caught.

Reese again meets Finch at the diner and thanks him for the job. This time Finch subtlely reveals that he is a regular there, perhaps a sign he is opening up."
