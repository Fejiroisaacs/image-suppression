Looks like revolutionary war times. Red coats vs. blue coats. A bluecoat shoots his gun at the redcoats hiding behind a tree. He comes out and feels the pulse of a fallen comrade. Another soldier suddenly yells, ""CRANE!!"" while pointing to something behind him.

A redcoat soldier riding a pale white horse jumps over a small barrier. He looks pretty menacing and his face is completely covered with some kind of cloth. Crane shoots him in this shoulder with his gun and the red coat falls off his horse. Instead of staying down, he simply rises back up like he is not even hurt. Crane has a 'WTF' look on his face. The redcoat takes out this huge halberd and takes a swipe at Crane. The camera zooms in on the tatoo or some kind of burn mark on the red coat's hand; looks like a bow of some type. The red coat swings his halberd and slices open Crane's chest. As Crane is about to fall, he swings his sword cutting the redcoat's head off. Crane falls down as does the headless horseman.. Everything fades to black.

We hear a woman's voice saying that they don't have much time...

Suddenly we see Crane's hands burst out of the ground like he has been buried alive. Jars containing snakes, frogs and other weird things start to break around him.. He is in some kind of cave. Crane stumbles around and touches one of the rocks which magically opens the cave to the outside world. It is all foggy everywhere when he comes out and looks to be morning or afternoon. He wanders around and suddenly notices that he is now walking on asphalt. He touches it, wondering what in the world is going now. Suddenly a huge semi track zooms by nearing hitting him. Another car drives by and clips him with the side view mirror. We see a hawk of some kind land on a sign which says:

Sleepy Hollow population: 144,000

Crane runs away from the scene into the fog.

Cut to a scene with the sheriff talking to his deputy at some diner. It is now nighttime. The deputy's name is Abbie. They joke around about this and that. The deputy is suppose to be leaving for Quantico next month. She has been accepted to the FBI. She is excited, but the sheriff asks her if she is just running away. He jokes with her that she is going to miss all of this. They receive a call that something is scaring the horses at some dude's farm. As they are leaving the diner, they pass a priest who is sitting in the booth behind them. The sheriff and pastor greet each other. They drive down there to check it out, thinking it is probably just wolves or something.

They drive to the farm and suddenly there is wind, lightning and thunder every. Feels like some scene from a Tim Burton movie. The sheriff tells Abbie to go and look for the owner while he goes to check out the horses. Abbie knocks on their door and there is no one home. She walks around and finds a rifle on the ground. Next to the rifle, she finds the body of the owner missing his head. She radios the sheriff, telling him that the owner is dead. The transmission kind of breaks up. The sheriff looks up and sees the Headless Horseman walk out of the stable with a white horse. He looks pretty freaked out and starts to unload his gun on him. It does not seem to faze him. By the time Abbie reaches the barn, the huge blade from the halberd comes through the wall. The Headless Horseman comes out and rides away. Abbie sees everything and notices the bow-shaped burn or tattoo on the horseman's hand. When she goes into the barn, the sheriff is dead. He has also been beheaded. She radios out officer down...

In town, another deputy is in his car and almost hits Crane. For reasons unknown at the time, he immediately arrest Crane for the murder of the sheriff.

In the morning, they have Crane locked up. Abbie says that he is not the person who killed the sheriff. They hook him up to a lie detector and start asking him questions. He tells them that his name is Ichabod Crane and he is a spy for General Washington. He had a wife named Katrina. He was with the British army, but once he saw what was happening he became a spy. How he thought he had died since his chest was sliced open, etc... He is surprised to find out that so much time has passed and has no idea what is going on. He passes the lie detector tests. Everyone thinks that he is crazy. They are going to put him in a psychiatric ward. Abbie asks the captain if she could interview him once. He refuses, but she tells him that she wants closure since her partner and friend just died. He agrees to let her take him to the psychiatric ward.

She goes to the holding cell where Ichabod wonders when woman were allowed to wear trousers. How she escaped slavery, etc... Basically everything you can possible say to piss off an African-American woman, he says it. Ichabod asks her if the killer had a bow-shaped tattoo or burn on his hand. Abbie asks how he could possible know that since she was the only one who saw it. She starts to drive him to the psychiatric ward and on the way there, the priest from the dinner sees him. He looks really scared. Ichabod asks her if she has experienced something that she can't explain before. She does not answer. Ichabod tells her that he was sure that he shot the horseman and yet it did not even faze him. Abbie then asks him to take her to the cave where he was buried. They arrive at the cave, and they look around. Ichabod finds a bible next to where he was buried. Memories kind of pass before him. We can now see the woman who said that they don't have much time. Ichabod is lying in some kind of bed and the bible he is holding is pressed against his chest. We also see the priest from the diner in the vision as well. She tells him that he is sorry about not telling him something but this is the only way... He snaps out of it and sees that the there is a bookmark in the bible. The bookmark points to the Book of Revelations.

It is now night and the Horseman has come for the priest at the diner. The priest runs around his church when he finally encounters the Horseman. He does some kind of magic and chains from the walls shoot out. The Horseman breaks them with his halberd. The priest yells out that he will never tell him where it is, that he would rather die. The Horseman chops his head off.

The police arrive on the scene. Abbie brings Ichabod with and tells him to stay in the car. Her captain is beyond pissed since she disobeyed a direct order. She tells him that he could not have killed the priest since he was with her the whole afternoon. He does not care. The guy who arrested Ichabod tells her that she has to distance herself from Ichabod. He advises her that Ichabod will bring her down.

The hawk that landed on the Sleepy Hollow sign lands on top of the police car. Ichabod tries to get out but it is difficult since he does not know how to open the door. He finally gets out and starts to follow the hawk. The deputies try to arrest him again but Abbie comes to his rescue. The hawk lands on the grave stone and it happens to be the grave of Katrina Crane. She was burned for practicing witchcraft.

Abbie finally takes Ichabod to the mental institution. While there, she admits that she has experienced something that she could not explain. When she was a child, Abbie and her sister were walking through the woods to go home. Suddenly they felt something that was not quite right. They both saw these four white trees and there was some kind of a creature beyond them. The creature made some kind of a noise and they both blacked out. When the police found them, they could not find any white trees and there was no creature. Everyone thought that they had made the whole thing up. She made it through all right but her sister has been in and out of mental institutions since the incident. They wish each other good night and he is locked up in a room.

Abbie visits the sheriff's office. She is looking around and picks up a picture of herself when she graduated the academy. As she picks it up, she hears something rattle. She looks and finds a key hidden in the back of the picture frame. She wanders around his office trying to see what the key might unlock. She then notices this handle on his desk and inserts the key. This huge drawer opens upward and there is a box of files hidden inside. She digs through and it seems that the sheriff was doing some weird investigating on his own. He has found that there seem to be two covenants living in the city. One for good and one for evil as far as he can tell. They have all changed their names and have scattered across the Eastern seaboard. There are a lot of unexplained homicides that no one is investigating. He knows that they are connected but he has no idea how. She then finds a file on her incident in the forest. It seems that the four white trees and creature have been seen before. In a diary to himself, he says that he wants to go to Abbie with this new information but he does not know how. How can she believe this? There is also some old looking map of the city with certain things marked off.. The captain suddenly appears and asks what she is doing there. She tells him that she was looking at old case files to see if there is anything useful. She leaves with the map and a few letters.

Ichabod is sleeping when the hawk from before lands on the bed frame at the foot of his bed. It flies into the mirror and all of a sudden he is in the woods with Katrina. She tells him that this was the only way she could communicate with him and guide him. She has been imprison somehow. He is the first witness. When he chopped off the Horseman's head, their blood mixed together. The both of them are now connected. When they put that spell on him, they had to put it on both of them. They trapped the Horseman's body in a box under the river while they buried him in that cave. He asks her if she is a witch. She tells him that she belongs to a covenant sworn to protect Sleepy Hollow from the evil that lies within it. She says that she guided him to the grave stone because that is where the Horseman's head is hidden. He has to find it because if the horseman finds it, the end will begin. The scene shakes and she says that they have found her. The four white trees appear behind her and the creature Abbie saw appears. She tells him that the Horseman cannot survive until morning. She begs him to help free her from her prison. All of the answers are in Washington's bible. He wakes up flailing around and the nurse and orderlies are trying to calm him down. The nurse is about to inject him with something. Abbie arrives to tell them that he is leaving with her.

Ichabod explains to her that it is all in Washington's bible. The Headless Horseman is one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Abbie shows him the map she found in the sheriff's old office. He says that he recognizes the handwriting. It belonged to General Washington. He tells her that he was sent on a secret mission by General Washington. At the battle which occurred at the beginning of the show, there was going to be a soldier there. His mission was to kill this soldier. He would know once he saw him because he would be different. He was riding a Pale Horse, so therefore Ichabod concludes that he must be Death himself. He also explains he knows what the Horseman is after: his own head, which has been hidden at the grave site of Katrina Crane. They rush off to the church where they found her grave site the night before.

It is now getting dark and we see the Horseman rise out of the river. His horse is already by the river side waiting. Abbie radios to her colleague that arrested Crane the day before. She tells him that he has to tell all units to report to the church. She believes the murderer will show up there today. The colleague tells him that she has to stop doing this. It is going to end badly for her. She asks him to trust her. She can't call it in because no one will believe her and the captain is already not liking her for taking Ichabod to the cave. He finally agrees as he is walking to his apartment. He notices that his door has been kicked in. He takes out his gun. He walks into his apartment and sees that someone has broken into his safe. The Headless Horseman suddenly rises from his chair. He has a shotgun and machine gun in his hand. Suddenly the deputy tells him he knows where his head is located and that he can help him.

It is now night and Ichabod is digging up Katrina's grave site. His shovel finally hits the coffin and he pulls out a glass jar with a decayed demon head inside. The eyes on the demon head sudden open as the Horseman has arrived. He starts to fire his shotgun at Ichabod and Abbie. Ichabod holds onto the jar and falls into the grave site that he dug up. Abbie falls back to hide on the street. The Horseman then takes out his machine gun and starts firing everywhere. The deputy comes up behind Abbie and she asks him where is the backup. He tells her that he called it in but no one is here yet. She turns around and he knocks her out. He takes her to his car and keeps on telling her that he wants to protect her. It can't be killed because it is Death. Ichabod is now fighting the horseman with a shovel. Pretty funny scene when he tries to hit the horseman on the head with the shovel only to miss because he has no head. =) Abbie kind of wakes up and nearly bites off the deputy's thumb. She handcuffs him the door and takes out a shotgun from his police car. She completely unloads on the Headless Horseman. Ichabod runs toward her and the Horseman follows. Finally the rest of the police show up. Ichabod and Abbie runs toward the police cars as the Horseman gives chase. Two police guys arrive on the scene to see the Headless Horseman walking towards them. They are both pretty freaked out. Suddenly the shoulder of the Horseman starts to smoke. We see the sun starting to come up. He turns around and talks towards his horse which suddenly appears. He rides away probably back to the river.

The Captain is beyond angry with Abbie but he has to believe her that a headless horseman is stalking the town. Those two police guys say that they saw the same thing as her. The Horseman's head is also in police custody now. The deputy that Abbie bit is also in custody and they want to interview him. The captain asks if she is still leaving for Quantico and she now says that she is staying. She is not running away.

We see the deputy sitting in the holding area. Suddenly a door of light opens up and the demon thing behind the four white trees comes out. He starts to beg to have another chance. It says that he has failed him and flips him backward. He is dead now. By the time Ichabod and Abbie arrive, we see the demon walking away through the mirror in the cell. It looks back at her and the mirror breaks. She recognizes that it was the thing that she saw when she was little. Ichabod suddenly takes out the Bible and tells her that them meeting might be destiny. Katrina called him the first witness. The Bible says that there would be two witnesses and the both of them would have to go through 7 years of tribulation. He thinks Abbie is the 2nd witness and therefore, they should work together to stop this."

He becomes caught in vines and is dragged down to a cave below.

He sees his wife Katrina, who tells him they're safe for the moment. ""Before the four horsemen will ride, an army of evil make way for their arrival. The first dark spirit rises with the blood moon,"" she tells him cryptically. ""She's one of us, you must stop her before she kills again,"" she says.

Katrina disappears and Ichabod wakes up with a start in his motel room.

At the station, Captain Irving tells Abbie Mills that the two other men who saw the Headless Horseman have recanted their stories, knowing how they sounded.

She's wondering what the explanation is for Andy's death. Surveillance footage shows him running full speed into the mirror and his head popping back, but Abbie knows that's not what happened.

She says Ichabod will back her up, but Irving points out he's not the most reliable witness and there's a psychological condition that could explain why he's so sure of who he is, even though it sounds crazy.

In his hotel room, Ichabod gets ready with the aid of Post-It explaining the shower, hair dryer and coffee machine.

Irving tells Abbie he's going to Albany and gives her some latitude to investigate. She goes to see Ichabod, who is super annoyed to be under guard at the motel.

He tells her about his vision, but she's skeptical.

In a morgue, a body comes back to life and rips its way out of a body bag. It's Andy, with his head bent backwards like a Pez Dispenser. The demon appears and pops his head back the right way, and gives him some sort of direction. Andy pulls a medallion from down his throat. The demon tells him something in whatever demon language he's speaking.

""Release who?"" Andy asks.

Abbie tries to pry the story of how Ichabod met Katrina and why he didn't know she was a witch. He thinks it was for his protection. She wants to get him a cover identity.

Andy, the undead with some extra skin around his neck where it was stretched backwards, gets in a patrol car.

Abbie attends the sheriff's funeral, as Ichabod hangs back. He visits Katrina's grave, wondering what ""one of us"" means.

Then he realizes she was referring to a witch.

In the dead of night, Andy goes to a circle of stones and puts the medallion from the demon on it. A crusty looking dead woman appears.

He relays the demon's message: ""The ashes of the pious will ordain your resurrection; take their flesh and you will reclaim yours.""

Later, undead Andy pulls over a man and asks his full name, Jeremy Stephen Firth. ""Jeremy, I want you to know where ever this road takes you -- and it won't be far -- it wasn't personal,"" Andy says. He gets in his patrol car and drives off.

The crusty dead woman leaps on Jeremy's windshield and incinerates his car with the touch of her hand.

Back at the station, Abbie is having a hard time adjusting to the idea they're after a witch. Crane thinks she hasn't had time to mourn the sheriff, whom he can tell meant a lot to her.

She tells a story about how she got into drugs after she and her sister saw the demon in the woods. She broke into a pharmacy and Sheriff Corbin caught her, but instead of taking her to jail, he took her to a diner and gave her a chance to change.

Abbie gets a call about unusual activity. It's Jeremy's burnt out car with his charred remains inside, bearing deep claw marks. There's something familiar about it to Crane.

He tells her about returning to his regiment during the war during a blood moon to find the same kind of burned out bodies. George Washington believed it was Serilda of Abadon, who had formed an alliance with the Red Coats.

They head back to the station to check the sheriff's files on the good and bad covens, but his office has been cleaned out.

While Abbie goes to find the files, a stern dude named Luke interrogates Crane, who says he's a history professor from Oxford, specializing in the American Revolutionary war. When Abbie comes back, Crane correctly guesses that Luke is her ex.

They need to get into the guarded archives across the street to get the sheriff's files. It used to be the armory and Crane knows a back way in. He finds the way he was looking for has been sealed off, so he hacks at the wall with the fire axe, revealing a secret passageway. It used to be used to transport weapons during the war.

He finds old crates of gun powder, right where he left them. The walls are lined with the bones of witches, who weren't deemed worthy of burial in graveyards.

In the archives, Abbie finds Corbin's files.

Andy visits a house and talks to a young boy playing soccer outside. Andy asks about this dad, and the boy says he's dead. The boy's name is Kyle Hemmington.

In the archives, Crane mentions he speaks several languages and has a photographic memory. He finds record of what happened to Sirilda. A white coven used magic to weaken her and a hunting party captured her.

Before she was burned at the stake she declared: ""By the turn of the blood moon the ashes of your ancestry shall be mine. Your flesh will be my flesh, I will live again.""

The magistrate who sentenced her was named Firth, like the burned victim in the car. They figure she needs the ashes of his descendants.

Kyle's mom tucks him in to bed.

Abbie traces the magistrates bloodline to the Firths and also a daughter who married a Hemmington.

Kyle hears noises in his house and goes downstairs to investigate. He finds the front door open. Charred Serilda lurks behind him.

He screams and his mom comes running. Abbie and Ichabod come in, Kyle is safe but swears he saw a woman who looked like she was on fire.

Kyle's dad's urn is missing. Kyle was adopted, the urn gives Serilda everything she needs.

Ichabod and Abbie try to figure out what Serilda needs to complete the ritual -- her own bones. They'd be buried down in the tunnels.

In the tunnels, Andy digs up a bag of bones as Serilda watches.

Abbie and Ichabod arrive and search for her.

Serilda begins the ritual with her bones and the ashes of the magistrates descendants. She lies down on top of the bones and begins to regenerate as flesh.

Ichabod arrives in time to see her come back to life. He fires with the gun Abbie gave him, but Serilda catches the bullet.

He runs for the black powder crates, thinking the gun is now empty.

Serilda talks to Ichabod about his wife, the one who bound her power. She tells him Katrina is in the world between worlds.

Crane puts the crates across her path in the tunnel and they take cover. He throws his torch and waits. Nothing happens at first, but then there's an explosion that takes out Serilda.

Later, Crane wonders if what Serilda said about his wife means she can be freed.

Crane goes to get coffee and Abbie looks towards Sheriff Corbin's office and sees him there. She thinks she's dreaming. She wonders if he was ever going to tell her what he knew, but he points out she wouldn't have believed him.

""You're so afraid of what you don't understand that it kept you from seeing who you really are, what you're meant to do,"" he says.

Finally, he tells her: ""Don't be afraid of No. 49, that's where you'll find you're not alone.""

Abbie turns around when she hears Crane. She had a vision.

In room 49 in a mental hospital , an orderly brings Jenny Mills her nightly pills as she does furious push-ups. She says she hasn't seen anything lately since she started taking the pills.

She fakes taking her pills and gets back to her work-out. The demon briefly appears in her room, but she doesn't see it and continues on, getting ready."

Abbie sees who the suspect is -- it's her teen self. Ichabod -- whose eyes are whited out - yells at her to tell the truth, and adult Abbie busts in, the room swirling. She doesn't understand what's going on. She wakes up and is called to a scene.

A doctor named Maura Vega is threatening to jump off a building and will only speak with Abbie. When Abbie gets up there, the doctor says ""everything she said"" was the truth and she believed her but didn't say anything.

The doctor turns to face Abbie, it's the woman from her dream and her eyes are whited out. The doctor is talking about Abbie's sister, Jenny.

""I've had this coming a long time, we all have,"" Dr. Vega says, and jumps.

Later, Abbie tells Ichabod and Irving about Vega's glazed over white eyes. They head to check out the corpse. The paramedic shows them the eyes, which she says look like cataracts. Then the eyeball explodes in grains of sand.

After the doctor's body is taken away, Irving finds that Dr. Vega did a year of residency at the same hospital where Jenny was locked up for her first year away.

Abbie tells Ichabod that Dr. Vega was in her dream, along with a faceless nightmare monster. But she'd never met Vega before. Ichabod calls it a prophetic dream, but Abbie isn't thrilled with the ""Witness"" label, no matter what he thinks the book of Revelation says.

Later, they watch a recording of Jenny's report of seeing a demon when she was a teenager. Abbie finds in Vega's notes a reference that Jenny showed no other signs of mental illness.

Abbie's willing to write off the doctor's suicide as guilt over letting Jenny stay locked up when she knew she wasn't crazy -- but Ichabod reminds her of the sand eyeball and her own dream. He wants to go see Jenny, whom Abbie hasn't spoken to in five years.

Jenny is locked up because she broke into a sporting goods store and stole $4,000 worth of survival gear because she was ""preparing for the end of days.""

Abbie hears the nurse call over to room 49 and remembers her vision in which the Sheriff told her not to fear ""Number 49.""

Jenny refuses to see Abbie, so Ichabod goes instead. After some small talk, he tells her he's seen the demon she saw. She sarcastically warns him to follow her sister's lead and not say things like that.

""That's why I'm in here and she's out there,"" Jenny says, telling him to ask Abbie for the whole story.

He tells Jenny about Dr. Vega's death and that she said ""we've all got it coming.""

He says they both know there are things ""not of this realm"" in Sleepy Hollow and the first Horseman has already killed people. He says he doesn't think Jenny is crazy, and neither does Abbie.

She tells him it's too late to fight the Horseman's army. ""My conscious is clear, ask Abbie if she can say the same,"" she says.

As they leave, Ichabod asks Abbie what happened and she tells him something she's never told anyone. When she saw the thing in the woods she remembered waking up. It felt like she'd been asleep moments, but it had been four days and the whole town was looking for them. A rancher found them and saw the demon, too.

When they were taken in, she told Jenny not to say anything about what they saw, but she didn't listen. Jenny told them what she saw, but Abbie said she didn't see anything. Abbie blames Jenny for not listening to her to stay silent.

They were in a good foster home and Abbie didn't want them to get in trouble for being out sneaking beers. Ichabod says Abbie needs to admit she turned her back on her sister. He thinks she's still afraid to admit what she saw.

He wants to go talk to the rancher, Mr. Gillespie, who also saw it and never said anything.

At his place, Gillespie drifts off with a beer in his hand. Suddenly, his eyes fly open at a noise. He goes to investigate and cuts his leg on nail sticking out of a table. The cloth he uses to wipe the blood away takes on an odd symbol.

He goes through his garage and takes out a gun. The demon appears behind him, then disappears as he fires.

Captain Irving comes out into the squad room with a road sign of a horseback rider -- with the top of the sign broken off. Detective Morales cops to the prank, which Irving commends him on. They get a report of shots fired at the Gillespie ranch and head there.

Abbie and Ichabod pull up to Gillespie's house, but it's already surrounded by patrol cars. Gillespie has taken his wife hostage and demands to speak to Abbie.

She goes in the house and finds Gillespie on the floor of his kitchen with his wife nearby. His wife warns Abbie to get out and says he's lost his mind.

She sees his eyes are glazed over white. Suddenly, Gillespie sees the demon behind Abbie and fires in the air. He warns her ""the Sandman"" is coming for her next. ""Next time you fall asleep, you're dead,"" Gillespie says. Then he blows his head off.

Later at night, outside the Gillespie house, Abbie tells Ichabod what Gillespie said. He suggests the Sandman is the faceless nightmare monster from her dream.

Back in the archives, Abbie looks into the sheriff's files on sleep demons and finds one that bears the symbol that was left on Gillespie's bloody rag.

Ichabod is familiar with the Mohawk sleep demon. They told him about the spirit of Rokaronti who would come for you if you didn't do right by your neighbor.

Ichabod suggests they visit a Mohawk shaman. She gives him the bad news about the Native Americans.

She suggests another kid of shaman and takes him to a used car lot, Geronimotors, which is owned by a Mohawk man. He thinks Ichabod is joking when he mentions Rokaronti, but eventually believes him. He takes them to a kind of lodge out away from town. He gives Abbie a potion that will allow her to walk in the dream world and take on the demon, but warns her if she dies there, she really dies.

Ichabod chugs the potion to join her. Then the shaman tells them they need scorpion venom to be able to control what they do in the spirit world.

He ties them down to tables and puts scorpions in jars on their bare stomachs to let them get stung.

They fall asleep and wake up in a foggy forest, looking for each other. The Sandman finds Abbie and flings sand in her eyes. He tells her she has been weighed on the scales of justice and been found wanting. She fires at him but the shots do nothing to it.

Ichabod finds a red door in the forest.

Abbie next finds herself in the interrogation with her sister from after they saw the demon.

Ichabod walks through the door and is in the police station. He sees Dr. Vega and Gillespie hanging from nooses in the hallway, a third empty one swings nearby.

The Sandman questions the sisters and again Abbie says she didn't see anything.

Adult Abbie is frozen in place as the Sandman sticks a long nail through the glass toward her face. Ichabod comes in and tells the Sandman to stop, but he turns on Ichabod and whacks off his hand, turning it to sand.

Abbie stops the attack by confessing what she saw that day and confronting the Sandman. She tells him she's not afraid anymore and won't desert her sister again.

The Sandman slowly turns to a kind of glass and is frozen in place, Abbie shatters him with a chair.

Later, in the archives, Abbie says she has some unfinished business to take care of. She's about to leave when Captain Irving comes in. He doesn't want to know the details of their investigation, just that it's closed.

Abbie visits Jenny at the mental hospital. The orderly takes Abbie to Jenny's room, but it's empty.

Abbie orders the building locked down. She finds a loose panel in the ceiling. ""She's good,"" Abbie says."

During the middle of the Boston Tea Party, Ichabod goes searching for something. Gen. Washington commanded they bring back a crate. When they confront a red coat for the crate, he recites an incantation in German and then blows himself up.

In present day Sleepy Hollow, Ichabod lovingly remembers his wife, who saved him and is somewhere between life and death herself. He talks passionately about her and the love that spans life and death and how rare it is. Then we realize he is telling this story to a roadside assistance representative, whom he has contacted remotely from the inside of the car. He leaves the woman from roadside assistance in tears and gives her the courage to go on.

He thanks her for unlocking the car.

He's waiting for Abbie outside the mental institution when Abbie comes out to report Jenny escaped.

Later, Abbie wants time to track Jenny down herself, but Captain Irving is hesitant. Abbie and Ichabod are sure Jenny is related to the Headless Horseman. He gives them 12 hours.

At a bar, Jenny settles in and Wendell the bartender pours her a shot and gets her her things. ""Remember when I told you, one day this town was going to go straight to Hell? I hate when I'm right,"" she says.

A German man gets a computerized voice call alerting him that Jenny has escaped and they believe she knows where ""item 37"" is. He's ordered to track it and her down.

Cut to the man showing up at the bar, where Wendell says he's never heard of Jenny Mills. When they threaten him, Wendell pulls a shogun on them. The German man easily disarms him and then begins the torture. After Wendell admits Jenny was there, the man skewers him.

Back at the station, Ichabod looks over Jenny's travels, including Mexico and Somalia. He wonders why Jenny would travel so far and come back to Sleepy Hollow.

He pesters Abbie for her family history. Their dad died when they were young, and their mom had a nervous breakdown. After the age of 12, Abbie had one foster home; Jenny had seven, but she stayed with the last family for over a year. Ichabod wants to talk to them.

In a truck strop bathroom, Abbie goves over her ""go bag,"" including a passport and two guns. She's ready for war.

Captain Irving reports to the murder scene at the bar. The bad guy cut off Wendell's head and skewered his body on the wall, but Irving knows it wasn't the work of the Horseman because the wounds weren't cauterized. Just the same, he wants to keep it quiet.

Abbie and Ichabod visit one of Jenny's foster mothers, who is cold and neglectful of the foster child she currently has. She tells Abbie that Jenny used to take off for Trout Lake.

Ichabod and Abbie head up to a lake cabin and break in. Ichabod is drawn to a Revolutionary War painting over the fireplace. Ichabod realizes the cabin belonged to Sheriff Corbin. He sees a picture of Corbin with Jenny and realizes they were close.

""You have no idea,"" Jenny says, stepping out and drawing a gun on them. Abbie draws on her sister and they stare each other down.

Abbie tells Jenny she's trying to make things right. The two sisters go after each other until Ichabod shouts them both down.

Jenny tells them she helped Sheriff Crane find rare objects, thus the world travels. She saw him the night before he died and he told her to come to the cabin if something happened to him, he had a bad feeling. She opens a secret panel in the cabin wall and takes out a sextant, for mapping sea travel. It comes with symbols branded into leather.

Ichabod recognizes the markings.

He explains that they went in for the weapon, creating the Boston Tea Party as a distraction. They just called it ""the destruction of the tea.""

The man guarding the weapon was a Hessian, a German mercenary loyal to the British crown.

Ichabod and his fellow soldiers were sent to claim a chest made of stone, covered in markings. He ferried it back to Washington, but never saw it again.

Ichabod demonstrates how the sextant works. There's a projector hidden inside that displays a map from Ichabod's era of Sleepy Hollow. They think it will lead them to the location of the mystery chest. Just then shots start coming through the windows.

The German and his men rain fire from semi-automatic weapons and one runs in and grabs the sextant. Two of them get away with it but Jenny pulls a gun on the German.

Jenny looks over the gun and says it's a military issue Uzi.

Ichabod checks him for tattoos and, in German, declares him Reinhessian, Shadow Warriors, 5th Battalion. The Hessian says the chest contains a doorway to the seventh circle of Hell where 72 condemned souls wait on a shore of flaming sand, from the Book of Revelation. Jenny recognizes that he's talking about the Lesser Key of Solomon.

It's a book of black magic, that is itself a key capable of unleashing the demons into their world.

The Hessian says they've been hiding in Sleepy Hollow. Captain Irving and a team head to the Hessian's house, following up Wendell's murder, and find all sort of body parts, skulls and weird bits in the basement.

Back with the German, he tells Abbie, Jenny and Ichabod that they've already met the man in charge. He knows all their names and describes the demon.

The Hessian says the demon summoned the Horseman and ""with each dark spirit he brings in to your world, his grand design gets stronger. He wants you to understand. My brothers have the map and soon the doorway will open and my task will be completed.""

He says something in German.

The man stops talking and chomps down on something in his mouth -- he chokes on a cyanide pill.

Ichabod translates his last words: ""Moloch shall rise.""

As Abbie and Jenny argue over whether to call the cops in or not, Ichabod starts drawing, recreating the map using his photographic memory.

The other two Hessians head to the church where the Key of Soloman is hidden.

On the drive there, Ichabod asks Jenny where she received her weapons training. Some in Mexico and other training in South Sudan where warlords were stealing food and women.

""I learned long ago that if you don't fight for the things you stand for, you don't really stand for them,"" Jenny says. Ichabod likes the argument, but Abbie is annoyed that he's impressed.

At the church, the Hessians find a book and one of them cuts his own hand to reveal hidden writing. It's written in Ars Goettia and says: ""The portal shall be opened, the key shall be turned, in the name of Moloch.""

As they recite the words, the baptismal font bubbles with flame and blood and demons start trying to break free from the ooze and flames.

The Mills sisters and Ichabod arrive and take on the men. One of the Hessians gets ahold of Abbie and tries to shove her into the teaming, screaming mass of demons, but Ichabod saves her. He picks up a knife and takes on the giant man.

Abbie picks up the book and one of the men gets Jenny in a headlock. He tells her to drop the book or Jenny dies. Jenny tells Abbie not to listen as Ichabod grapples with the other man.

Abbie heaves the book into the flames. Ichabod knocks out one man while Jenny gets the drop on the other. The book is swallowed up in the flames and the demons and everything suddenly recede.

Back at the station, Abbie explains to her sister that Ichabod thinks they're the two witnesses from Revelations. Jenny believes her, but isn't ready to forgive her yet.

""I can't take back what I did, but I can try to make it right,"" Abbie says. Abbie has filed paperwork to become her conservator and thinks she can get Jenny out of the mental institution in less than six months. She thinks they can work together to get answers.

""Corbin said one day you'd be back when you were ready. He asked me to find a way to try to forgive you. I said I didn't think I could,"" Jenny says.

""I'm sorry that it took me so long to find you,"" says Abbie.

Later, Ichabod finds Abbie and shows her a reference to Moloch in Paradise Lost. It's the demon she saw in the woods. Now they know who they're fighting."

He's chasing after her when she disappears. Then a masked figure on a horse comes charging at him. The boy, who is wearing colonial garb, takes off running toward the road. The man on the horse dissipates behind him.

Ichabod settles in to Sheriff Corbin's cabin, the perfect rustic home for him. Abbie suggests he spackle the bullet holes, and offers to tell him what ""spackle"" means. Abbie gets a call about the boy.

At the scene, Ichabod notices his old clothes and the fact his veins are turning black. The boy wakes up long enough to say something in Middle English.

Back at the station, Abbie reviews missing children reports. The boy said ""evil girl.""

Morales goes to Captain Irving to ask what Ichbod is still doing working with Abbie and Irving essentially tells him to butt out.

At the hospital, the boy is under full quarantine. Someone from the CDC sets Ichabod up with a video link to talk to the boy, whose name is Thomas.

Thomas apologizes for following the girl. He's from Roanoke. Ichabod wonders if he's from the lost colony, the first colony of the new world in North Carolina, 1587.

Back at Library HQ, Ichabod explains John White was the first colonist and had a daughter named Virginia, then returned to Europe to get supplies. When he returned three years later, every single person was gone. Ichabod suggests they've relocated to Sleepy Hollow.

Captain Irving calls -- the paramedic who treated Thomas has fallen ill. Abbie prevents Ichabod from sharing their theory with the captain just yet. They head to the woods where Thomas was found.

Meanwhile, in the hospital, the paramedic gets sicker and sees a horseman charging at him.

Morales' partner tries to encourage him to ease up on the Ichabod suspicion.

In the woods, Ichabod tracks Thomas' trail through the woods until they find a second set of prints.

At the hospital, more people who treated Thomas have fallen ill.

In the woods, Ichabod and Abbie reach a swamp with a tiny island in it. Ichabod tests the water and finds it's very deep, then he notices markings on a tree on the shore and one on the island and finds a hidden bridge. They walk across and into the lost colony of Roanoke. All of the townspeople are infected, but they don't seem sick.

One of the men explains that Roanoke was cursed by the Horseman of Pestilence. Virginia was the first to die and her spirit led the colonists there to protect them. The symptoms don't affect them there, but when Thomas left, he took the plague to the outside world, as the Horseman wanted all along. They must return Thomas to save them all.

Pestilence is also known as Conquest and if they don't return Thomas and allow the disease to spread, Pestilence will arrive in Sleepy Hollow. Abbie looks out among the trees and thinks she sees a figure on a horse.

Back at the hospital, the disease is spreading to CDC workers. Crane looks at his own veins and realizes he's also infected from when he first saw Thomas. The CDC workers inject him with something to knock him out.

While he's unconscious, he sees Katia. She hasn't been able to summon him for some time, and thinks the fact she can see him now means he's dead.

Morales gets a call back from Oxford, confirming Ichabod is a professor there and on sabbatical in Sleepy Hollow.

Katia explains she's trapped in purgatory with lost souls.

At the hospital, Abbie tries to convince Irving to let her take Ichabod and Thomas, but he orders her to help shut down streets instead.

Ichabod asks Katia why Moloch wants her soul.

Abbie ducks into the hospital chapel, to ask for a sign that taking Ichabod and Thomas back to Roanoke is the right thing to do. She notices the holy water on her way out and remembers Ichabod noting that something in the Roanoke environment was a cure and there was a spring in the center of town.

Katia is about to tell Ichabod why she's trapped in purgatory when he snaps back to consciousness. Abbie tells Irving her theory about the Roanoke water. He sets up a transfer of Thomas and Ichabod to an overflow facility and covers for Abbie to take them to Roanoke.

They trudge back through the woods as Thomas gets sicker and sicker. Pestilence the Horseman rides nearby.

They make it to the colony with the Horseman on their heels. Ichabod jumps into the spring with Thomas as the Horseman charges. The Horseman dissipates before he reaches them.

Suddenly, Abbie and Ichabod aren't in the middle of a colony anymore, but back in an empty forest. Ichabod realizes Thomas was dead all along. He was lured into the land of the living to spread a plague, but Abbie's faith that she was one of the witnesses allowed her to solve the puzzle.

Irving calls Abbie to tell her all the sick people are recovering.

Abbie tells Ichabod he belongs in Sleepy Hollow, in the here and now."

Ichabod gives it a shot: ""You, basket face! I thought only horses slept standing up!""

Abbie commends the effort but suggests next time he wait for the ump to make a call.

After the game, Ichabod heads to his wife's grave. As he's sitting there, he's hit in the neck by a dart and a man in a suit comes to put a hood over his head.

Abbie is driving on the road at night when suddenly things go hazy and she sees herself in an old house with a creepy baby carriage wheeling through. Abbie follows the sounds of the crying and finds it empty, with an old time toy in it. She turns around to see the Headless Horseman behind her. He stalks her through the house until she enters a room and slams the door behind her.

She sees hooded figures in black, holding hands and chanting around a table. There are candles lit everywhere. Abbie turns to see Katrina Crane. She explains the house is a doorway between worlds she can use to communicate with the two witnesses -- and Ichabod has been abducted.

The Horseman will return to Sleepy Hollow by nightfall and only the witnesses can stop him. She can't locate Ichabod because some sort of barrier is blocking her. She explains Abbie has to find the ""sin eater"" before nightfall to sanctify Ichabod, which will separate his blood from the Horseman, with whose fate he's become entwined.

Abbie returns back to her world just in time to veer out of the oncoming path of a semi.

Abbie goes to Captain Irving and tries to explain her visit from the witch and Ichabod's disappearance. Irving is skeptical, but supportive.

Abbie goes to see her sister Jenny to ask her if she knows about the sin eater.

Ichabod comes to somewhere, still woozy. He sees candles all around him and a man in a suit addresses him. He has a book which he says is the true account of Ichabod Crane. The man isn't inclined to say who he is, but Ichabod sees his ""JR"" cufflinks and deduces he's James Rutledge, the descendant of Edward Rutledge, youngest signatory of the Declaration of Independence, who he apparently resembles. He notices a square ring mark on Rutledge's finger and signs of hexes around him. He's a Free Mason, like Ichabod. But Rutledge wants him to prove his identity, he says they're dealing with shape shifters and demons.

He quizzes Ichabod on when he first heard a phrase. Ichabod remembers when he was in service for the British and charged with interrogating a free black man about the origin of a pamphlet advocating the end to slavery. Ichabod a told a Quaker nurse wishes to see him. He meets Katrina, who questions his authority. The man he's supposed to interrogate says he's in good hands and Katrina thinks she sees a conscience in Ichabod.

Back in Sleepy Hollow, Jenny explains a Sin Eater reaches inside your soul and swallows your sins. She followed a man who was meeting with death row inmates whose last words were all ""I am sanctified."" But she never found him.

Back in the 1800s, Arthur Bernard tells Ichabod that there are demons among them.

After three days of interrogation, Ichabod was called away to stand guard at an execution of three men. Katrina was in the audience. Crane appeals to his superior that the hangings are not a good way to win loyalty. When Crane looks at him, he sees a demon's face.

Ichabod goes to talk to Katrina after the hanging, saying he feels like he's known her for a long time. He mentions the demon. ""They were right, you are the one! You possess a gift, the power to bear witness,"" she tells him. She urges him not to stand idly by in the face of evil.

Back in Sleepy Hollow, Abbie explains that Ichabod makes her feel like she has a purpose. Jenny suggests Katrina could have been more specific since her husband's about to be a dead man.

Abbie realizes the name they're looking for in the prison visitor logs is of a dead man -- their mystery man takes on the name of dead death row inmates. She finds the last one he used -- he's in Hartford, Connecticut.

Jenny and Abbie go to his house and knock on Henry Parrish's door. She says her friend is missing and she needs his help, but he says he doesn't do it anymore. He explains how much seeing people's true souls has worn him down. Abbie explains the blood tie linking Ichabod's spirit to the Horseman from Revelations.

He says he could use her connection to Ichabod to find him. When he protests, she grabs him and he sees that Ichabod is underground, behind a door with a Free Masons symbol on it. That's all he can tell her.

Abbie heads to the tunnels under the town.

When Crane returns to Alfred Bernard's house, his captain tells him to take Bernard into the forest and kill him. Out in the woods, Bernard tells Ichabod he's valuable to the case and if Ichabod kills him he'll carry sin inside his heart forever.

Ichabod fires, but misses intentionally. Bernard tells Ichabod to find Katrina, who will lead him to General Washington. He tells Ichabod to tell her ""order from chaos"" and she'll know what side he's on. Bernard is walking away when a shot is fired. His captain has shot him. He charges Ichabod, calling him a traitor.

Ichabod draws his sword to fight and sees the man turn into a demon. He's attacking when two other soldiers ride up and the demon runs off.

Ichabod is wounded and makes his was to Katrina.

Back with Rutledge, Ichabod explains his sin was not acting sooner to save Bernard. This is enough for Rutledge to be convinced of his identity. The book with the account of that story that Rutledge has was written by Katrina. She was the Masons ally until she saved Ichabod and wouldn't tell the Masons where he was. ""She knew the inevitable outcome of your tie to the Horseman. Regretfully, a fate we would have sealed for you long ago, and one we have no choice but to seal it for you now,"" Rutledge says.

He presents Crane with a box, saying it's the only way to ensure the Horseman's reign ends forever.

Abbie and Jenny search the tunnels and find the Free Masons symbol. Two men with guns find her, but they take her peacefully inside to see Crane. He tells her that he has to die to end the Horseman, but she updates him on Katrina's message and the Sin Eater. She wants to bring Ichabod to him, but he doesn't think there's time. He thinks it's the only way, and explains he's living on borrowed time. He's grateful to have met her. He takes her hand and prepares to drink whatever the Masons prepared for him. He drinks.

He hears Abbie and Katrina telling him ""stay with me!"" and sees Henry Parrish standing over him. He excited to meet Ichabod, to find the reason for the gift he was given. He can remove the poison before it stops Ichabod's heart, along with his sins.

He stabs Ichabod's hand the tastes his blood. He sees the Horseman in Ichabod's memories. ""As long as you carry your sin in your heart, it allows the Horseman to be tied to you,"" Parrish says. He commands Ichabod to think about Arthur Bernard and summon him. When Ichabod opens his eyes he sees Bernard sitting across from him. Ichabod feels remorse that he couldn't save him, but Bernard asks if Ichabod would have found his true path if he hadn't died. Bernard's death saved Ichabod's soul, only Ichabod chose to see it as a sin. Bernard tells him to forgive himself and his blood tie to the Horseman will be broken. He tells Ichabod he will have help in his quest to vanquish the Horseman. He gives him words to repeat to banish the Horseman from his blood.

In front of him, the blood on the table moves and Parrish mops up a dab of it with bread and eats it. The room quakes and Ichabod can feel the tie is broken.

Abbie tells him not to pull a stunt like that again.

Night has fallen. Parrish can feel the Horseman is coming. ""We'll be ready,"" Ichabod says.

Out in the forest, the Horseman finds the dirt pit where Ichabod was buried."

Abbie thinks it's a good time to teach Ichabod about the fist bump.

They confer with Captain Irving, who marvels that Thomas Jefferson designed the chamber they're using. ""He foresaw holding the worst kind of demons who walk the earth -- a product, no doubt, of his years spent trying to reason with the French,"" Ichabod says.

Ichabod suggests they interrogate the Horseman using Andy Brooks. Abbie asks Irving to tell her sister what's going on.

Out in the woods, two hunters come upon the Horseman's white horse, with its firey red demon eyes. One of the riders dials his phone to report something has happened to the rider. He seems to be speaking German. He shoots his companion.

Ichabod and Abbie search for Andy in the tunnels and find where he's been bunking, but he's not there.

Irving has a surly Jenny Mills brought to the station and gives her the good news about the captured Horseman. Irving is interrupted by word there's a situation at Adams Antiquities. Jenny knows the place, she once did ""acquisitions"" for the owner. Irving checks whether she's on board, she is.

Ichabod finds Egyptian hieroglyphs in Andy's hideout, he realizes they mean Andy is the Horseman's necromancer -- person to speak for the dead. When Andy returns, Ichabod suggests bringing Andy with them to the cell to interrogate the Horseman. Andy doesn't want to, and explains that his soul doesn't belong to him anymore, so if Moloch commands him to do something, he has no choice. He warns them about the darkness in confronting death.

At the antiquities shop, none of the valuable stuff is missing. Jenny shows Irving a secret room where the owner hid his best stuff. They find Adams shot inside, but alive. He directs them to a box with 16th century Druidic scripture. It contained an item that could be used to break a hex spell -- like the one protecting the Horseman's cell. It was stolen by Hessians, who speak German.

They think the Hessians will take out the power next to kill the UV lights helping to hold the Horseman.

Ichabod and Abbie take Andy into the Masonic cell. Ichabod taunts the Horseman to get him to talk. When he gets close, a necklace falls out of the Horseman's scarf. Ichabod recognizes it as Katrina's.

It was given to her by her former fianc√©, Abraham Van Brunt, Ichabod's former best friend.

Flash back to Ichabod counseling Abraham about which necklace to buy for her, advising the emerald instead of something more showy. She loves it and Abraham takes credit, but she knows Ichabod picked it.

Privately, she tells Ichabod she's breaking off her engagement, which was arranged, because she loves him.

Back in the cell, Ichabod wants to know if the necklace means the Horseman knows where Moloch holds Katrina.

Irving and Jenny go to the power station and see men with guns. Irving goes to investigate. One of the men comes up behind him, but he quickly disarms him. When he finds Jenny, she has two more in cuffs. SWAT comes out and helps them get the rest.

Jenny notices something missing from the Hessian's truck, and they find evidence of a bomb.

In the cell, the Horseman says he knows Katrina's fate, but won't tell yet. Ichabod thinks the Horseman is following him personally. The Horseman says Ichabod was his mission, after Ichabod betrayed and killed his former partner: Abraham.

There's an explosion at the power plant and the UV lights cut out in the cell, but the Horseman is still held by the spell.

The Horseman begins to grow stronger and Ichabod wants to keep questioning him. He insists to Abbie that he didn't kill Abraham.

Pennsylvania 1774 The day after Katrina broke off her engagement to Abraham, he and Ichabod were charged with transporting the Declaration of Resolve -- a precursor to the Declaration of Independence -- to the Continental Congress.

As they walked through enemy territory, Abraham's mind was elsewhere. Ichabod tried to tell him there were many other women who would have him, then told him that he was in love with Katrina. Abraham got angry and drew his sword to fight and would not accept Ichabod's attempts to yield to him. Finally, Ichabod fought back, only to end up on the ground. Then a shot rang out and Abraham was hit by a man in a mask with a heptagram tattoo like the Horseman. Other Hessians like him ran out and Ichabod killed as many as he could, trying to help his mortally wounded friend. But Abraham yelled at him to leave and the last thing Ichabod saw was the men drawing their swords over Abraham as he lay on the ground bleeding.

Back in the cell, Abbie suggests Ichabod take a break since the Horseman is getting to him.

Irving arrives with Jenny. They're still looking for the item the Hessians will use to break the hex, but first they'd have to break into the cell to perform the Druidic incantation.

Abbie, Jenny and Irving leave to get weapons to defend the cell, leaving Ichabod alone with the Horseman. Abbie cautions him not to lose his cool.

Chained to his chair in the cell, Andy pulls the Druidic item from inside his body and begins the incantation to summon the minions of Moloch. Demons begin stalking Abbie and Irving in the tunnels. They scale the walls and shatter when fired upon.

Ichabod talks to the Horseman again, accusing him of betraying his master to pursue him. Ichabod sees that Andy has the item and he finishes the incantation, freeing the Horseman. The Horseman gets a sword and gives another to Ichabod, who engages him.

From his moves, Ichabod realizes who he's fighting: Abraham.

The Horseman tells Ichabod that he, Abraham died, then Moloch came to him. They shaved his head, put a mask on him and he became one of the Hessians, complete with the brand on his hand. Abraham made a deal with the devil to get what he always wanted: Katrina.

Ichabod realizes she's being held captive for the Horseman.

Andy recites one more incantation and the minions come running, right as the Horseman gets the better of Ichabod. ""Stop! You can't kill him, the master forbids it!"" Andy tells the Horseman as he's about to stab Ichabod. ""Tell Abby I'm sorry,"" Andy says, as the minions take him and the Horseman away. Ichabod is left alone.

Later, Ichabod feels responsible for Abraham becoming the Horseman. He wonders why Moloch spared him from the Horseman. The Horseman said Katrina's soul ""will"" be his, so they hope she's being held until he rides with the other Horsemen. Katrina is the Horseman's weakness. ""Now more than ever, we need Katrina,"" Ichabod says."

She plans to fix it up. Her bodyguard, Sam, thinks it looks haunted.

She explores inside and finds a closet fill of vines. She starts grabbing at them but they grab back. She screams.

At the station, Ichabod doubts the Scottish origins of the fast food they're eating. He sets Abbie straight on Thanksgiving. The pilgrims didn't have any sugar to make sauce or pie, and they had venison, not turkey. All the family time irks Ichabod, he misses his wife.

Captain Irving calls them in about the socialite Lena Gilbert, whose lineage goes back to the founding fathers. She's missing. Irving is giving them the case because Lena left a note with ""Katrina C."" written on it and her last GPS coordinates were Sleepy Hollow.

Ichabod wants to know about Gilberts from his era who owned land. Lena's mother was a Fredericks, dating back to Lachlan Federicks, a charter member of the Continental Congress and a friend of Ichabod's.

Ichabod knows the mansion. They drive there. It hasn't been lived in for more than a few weeks at a time since the time of Lachlan Fredericks. But it looks much different to Ichabod.

Flashback His estate was a safe haven, guaranteeing protection to former slaves, many of whom stayed to work for Lachlan.

Ichabod and Abbie go inside. They see the back of a man in a chair, but soon find that he's dead. It's Sam the bodyguard and his face is badly bloodied and scratched. Ichabod sees bloody hand prints on the floor. They think Lena might still be alive.

Abbie tires to radio in, but can't get a signal. When she goes for the door, it slams shut. They try the windows and one by one all the windows and doors in the house slam shut. ""Not to be an alarmist,"" Ichabod says. ""But we are in a damn haunted house,"" Abbie says.

Abbie freaks out a little but Ichabod presumes the house wants something from them. They decide to find Lena. Abbie sees a woman walk past and then disappear.

Ichabod sees a familiar book on the floor. It belonged to Katrina. It contains a letter he wrote before he went to confront the Horseman and it was only to be given to her if he died. Ichabod doesn't understand how it could have ended up in the house.

Ichabod remembers the house as a force for good.

Flashback to Ichabod and Katrina meeting Lachlan Fredericks and the mistress of the house, Grace Dixon, who is African-American. Ichabod supposes the house was also a refuge from the supernatural. They wonder if one of those evil forces is now occupying the house and taking its anger toward Lachlan out on Lena, his descendant.

Ichabod and Abbie head down some creepy stairs and find Lena alive and wrapped in vines in the closet. Ichabod starts to cut her free and one of the vines bleeds.

Outside, a creature made entirely of roots rises from the ground and walks toward the house.

Ichabod and Abbie cut Lena free as she explains to them that the house is alive.

Back at the station, Irving is annoyed he can't reach them. Jenny is there to return the guns she lifted from him to defeat the Horseman. Jenny tells Irving she's planning a small Thanksgiving and invites him.

Irving's ex-wife Cynthia and his young daughter Macy, who is in a wheelchair, arrive.

Back at the house it's now nightfall. Lena explains she saw Katrina Crane's name in a ledger and thought it could lead her to answers about the house and Lachlan. There are rumors he was involved in witchcraft. Ichabod wanders if Lachlan and Katrina were members of the same coven.

Their conversation is interrupted by something very large coming at them. They run for cover and find a secret passageway into the walls. Abbie gets separated from Ichabod and Lena and the root monster catches up with them.

Ichabod and Lena run from it and run into a flock of crows in the stairway.

Abbie is alone in the walls and tries to keep it together. She kicks her way through a wall and then senses someone behind her. She turns around to see the ghost of Grace, who tells her ""it's time,"" then disappears.

Back at the station, Macy wheels through like she owns the place and bumps into Jenny. She thinks Jenny is dating her dad, but Jenny explains she doesn't even like him half the time, but she suggests Macy give him a chance.

Cynthia isn't happy with Frank for canceling weekends he's suppose to spend with Macy. He can't really tell her about how he's helping stave off the apocalypse. She tells him Macy needs stability and if he cancels one more time, she'll file for full custody.

Back in the house, Grace warns, ""It's coming, hurry.""

Abbie sees a scene from the past, Katrina in bed -- in labor. Grace helps Katrina deliver her baby boy.

Abbie is stunned. She goes searching for Ichabod and finds him. He tells her the creature dragged Lena away.

Abbie tells him what she just saw. ""Katrina came back here because she was going to have a baby,"" she says. The protective hex on the property would have kept them safe.

But Abbie says there's more. During the birth, crows started attacking and the root creature rose up. Lachlan knew it was sent by Moloch and he went to confront it, but the creature attacked and killed him.

Abbie didn't see what happened to his son. They hear Lena scream. They find the creature grabbing on to her, choking her. In the dark, they can't see the creature to fight back, but then Ichabod tells Abbie to shoot the roots, which wounds the creature. He releases Lena.

Abbie sees Grace again, guiding them to an exit.

They make it outside to the car, where Ichabod grabs an ax. He heads back inside to take on the thing that came after his son. He warns Abbie not to follow him.

Inside, Ichabod looks around for the creature, using road flares to light the room. He finds the creature and swings at it, telling it he knows who it serves. ""You think you can attack those I love without consequence?"" Ichabod says as he attacks wildly.

He hacks at the creature, finally chopping it to death. ""Give Moloch my regards,"" he says.

He goes outside covered in blood, and ready to go home.

Abbie comes to the archives to get Ichabod for Thanksgiving. She brought rum. He's struggling with the knowledge he had a son. There's a package from Lena (Ichabod wonders if it's more treasures from the Amazon), that contains all her family's old papers, including from Grace Dixon. It includes Grace's family tree, down to Lori Roberts -- Abbie's mother. Her ancestor brought Ichabod's son into the world.

They toast to finding family."

His head is swimming with questions about the son he just learned he had and never got to meet. He especially wants to know why his wife didn't tell him she was pregnant.

He wants to contact Katrina. He reached out to the only man he knows who might be able to help. Henry Parrish, the sin eater who helped separate Ichabod's blood from the Horseman's, pulls up in a taxi.

Inside, Parrish isn't sure how he can help. He's never tried that kind of contact before. He warns Ichabod that his life would be in danger if Ichabod goes into the other realm to talk to her and he'll be tempting fate.

Ichabod thinks not doing it is a far worse risk. Finally, Henry cautions Abbie that what he's about to do will be scary and she can't interrupt.

Henry urges Ichabod to think of Katrina, then he starts strangling him. ""I told you, the closer he is to death, the shorter distance there is to travel,"" Henry says.

Ichabod gets woozy and sees himself in a church. There's a baby carriage with a doll inside. He sees Katrina and cuts right to the chase. The baby was named Jeremy, after Ichabod's grandfather. She didn't know she was pregnant when she buried him, and neither did her coven when they punished her for doing so. She learned of her condition in Europe in search of a spell to unbind him from the Horseman. When she returned, her coven persecuted her, so she sought refuge at the house of Lachlan Fredericks. She knew her coven would be after him if they knew about him so she left him with Grace (Abbie's ancestor) and her husband, a pastor, with the doll she made for him, promising it would protect her.

That was the last time she saw him, in the church like the one they're standing it. It's in her purgatory, where her coven banished her, and she lights a candle for him once a day.

She apologizes and he promises he'll find out what happened to him and get her out of purgatory. Suddenly, there's a pounding on the door. Katrina urges him to return to his realm as a creature busts through the door.

Ichabod wakes up on the cabin floor and tells Abbie what he's learned.

Somewhere out in the woods, the same faceless monster digs its way out of the earth.

Back in the cabin, Abbie suggests they check the library's historical records. Henry is in a hurry to get to his train, but Ichabod and Abbie ask him to stay. He agrees. The creature watches them drive off.

In New York, Frank Irving meets with his pastor, asking him about a sermon he once gave about two witnesses. The pastor explains that the New Testament says ""witness"" mean martyr, and that the two are destined to die. The apostles that follow them usually suffer the same fate. Irving is frustrated, thinking he's given enough in his public service and having his daughter get hit by a car. He wonders, if God has a plan, who is it for?

At the library, after sweet talking the librarian, they find a record that mentions Grace dying young in a fire. The record says the townspeople were afraid of Jeremy, they had seen him start fires, just by crying. He inherited Katrina's powers. He survived the fire unharmed, but Grace and Joseph died.

The record says only that Jeremy was sent to an orphanage for children of the war. Henry suggests the librarian Ms. Hudson knows more than she's saying -- lying is a sin and he can sense it.

They go to look for her. She's in her car outside when the creature reaches through her window.

They come outside and find Ms. Hudson crushed inside her flattened car.

Frank picks up his daughter Macy from his ex-wife Cynthia. He tells her he's sorry he was gone so much. She says if he'd said that a year ago, he'd still be living there. Macy hears them.

Back in the archives, they go through the librarian's effects. Ichabod explains his struggles with the way language has changed. In his day ""intercourse"" meant conversation and ""awful"" meant ""awe inspiring.""

""So if I went out with a guy and we had 'awful intercourse,' we'd be going on a second date?"" Abbie asks.

""Disconcerting, yet accurate,"" Ichabod says.

Abbie takes out a box and when she sets it on the table, it sends a shiver through Henry. He says it's filled with pain. It bears the symbol for Katrina's coven, the Sisterhood of the Radiant Heart. The librarian was a witch, which explains her odd reaction to Ichabod -- she knew who he was.

Ichabod opens the box, and Henry says it reeks of death and pain. There's a drawing of Katrina's handmade doll for Jeremy inside.

Abbie saw the same doll in her vision of Katrina. Henry touches it and tells Ichabod, he thinks the misery inside was Jeremy's.

Henry has a vision of Jeremy being whipped in the orphanage by the priest. Jeremy bled on to the doll his mother made him and called upon her promise to protect him, creating the creature out of his rage and pain. The creature looks like a giant muscle-bound version of the hand-stitched doll. In the vision, it attacks the vicious priest and snaps his neck, then bows to Jeremy.

Ichabod realizes that's what he saw in the church with Katrina, and he thought he felt it again in the woods at the cabin. It followed Ichabod back.

They think it attacked Ms. Hudson because she was a member of the coven who banished Jeremy's mother.

Frank takes a walk with his daughter in the park. He stops to get her a hot chocolate when the vendor's eyes gloss over and he tells him that God may have a plan for him but ""we"" have a plan for him, too. Frank grabs the guy, but the demon spirit transfers to a woman walking by. Two cops see him shaking up a confused hot chocolate vendor. He shows his badge, but his daughter is still weirded out.

Henry finds Ichabod feeling guilty about bringing his son's rage into the world, then and now. ""Whatever became of your son, you speak for him now,"" Henry says. He thinks Jeremy was good because he was molded from Ichabod's clay.

The phrase reminds Ichabod of Washington's Bible, which Katrina buried with him. He runs to look up a passage and realizes they're dealing with a golem, a creature made from mud and imbued with its creator's passions.

Abbie remembers seeing four women in black veils, like ones the librarian has ticket stubs from visiting at carnivals. They're members of the same coven, which means the Golem is after them. They're the ones who banished Katrina, which Ichabod thinks means they could bring her back.

They find a ticket stub for a carnival outside town. When they reach it, Ichabod insists on going to speak to the ""Four Who Speak as One"" alone, given what they did to his wife.

Inside, one looks at his palm and they lift their black veils to reveal weird colored eyes and dirty, jagged teeth. They tell him it was foretold that his arrival would seal their fate. ""Tonight we die,"" they say.

They don't see any point trying to avoid their destiny, the Katrina did in saving Ichabod. He tells them the Golem is coming. They know it, and tell him that people hunted Jeremy and Golem centuries ago. They were able to send the creature to purgatory, but Jeremy's powers were too great. Instead, they stopped his heart and buried him. They tell him only his son's blood, which gave the golem life, can kill it.

Ichabod leaves the witches and rejoins Abbie just as the golem attacks the witches. Abbie and Henry try to take refuge, but the golem shatters a funhouse mirror. A shard hits Ichabod and Henry suggests Ichabod's blood is the same as Henry's and he can stop it.

Ichabod approaches the golem with the shard and tries to tell it it doesn't have to fight anymore, and that it only exists because he wasn't around. But when the golem charges, Ichabod has no choice but to stab it with the glass shard. Ichabod takes its hand as it lies on the ground and tells it he can move on from his life of pain. Ichabod calls it, ""my son."" The golem dies and only the doll is left.

Back at the station, Henry is ready to leave for his train. They thank him for his help.

Abbie gives Ichabod his present early: a stocking with his name on it. ""You embroidered my name on some oversized hosiery,"" he marvels. She explains it's tradition.

When Abbie leaves, Ichabod sees a mirror crack in front of him. It mends and suddenly Ichabod sees himself in the dark woods with Moloch's voice taunting him. ""I offer this warning: the saint's name is a sign. When you know my name, more will take form, then the end of days begins. Your death is assured, you and the second witness....I touched her soul once, soon it will be mine forever, and you will give it to me.""

Ichabod wakes up on the station floor. Abbie finds him. ""Moloch is coming for your soul, he says I will deliver it to him,"" Ichabod says."

Ichabod steps out of the bathroom wearing skinny jeans. He's allowing Abbie to update his wardrobe.

He's vexed by Molloch's message about a saint's name and the fear Molloch was able to instill in him. Abbie thinks it's a fool's errand just to keep them busy since they're disrupting Molloch's overall plan.

Ichabod refuses her next costume change and comes back out in his musty old clothes.

At the station, Captain Irving watches as the man who threatened him in the park takes and passes a polygraph. He wants the woman the man bumped into in the park brought in.

When she reaches the station, the demon inside transfers to a cop passing by.

Irving gets a call from inside the station. A demon voice tells him to get Washington's Bible from Ichabod, and Iriving sees a vision of the word Bible dripping in blood. He has until tonight or they come after his daughter. Irving walks into his precinct to see who is on the phone and spots the possessed deputy. He draws his gun and grabs the man, but not before the demon is able to transfer to Detective Jones.

Frank calls his priest, who offers to meet him somewhere safe.

Ichabod and Abbie explain the Bible to Irving, saying that Katrina told them it was important but they're still not sure why.

Abbie finds a DVD in Sheriff Corbin's things that his notes describe as containing a demon who could jump from person to person. On the DVD, Corbin is filming himself at his cabin and explains he has a 19 year old woman who appears possessed. It's Jenny, Abbie's sister.

Later, they tell Jenny about the DVD. They haven't watched it yet, and ask her permission, explaining they need to know how to defeat the demon.

The three of them watch it. Possessed Jenny says Jenny has been ""marked"" and chosen as a ""vessel."" ""War will come, and you will be among its first casualties. You, August Corbin, will die at the hands of the Horseman of Death. And I will kill the sister. I will kill Abbie,"" it says.

Jenny says the demon has been gone for a long time, but she doesn't know how. She leaves.

Frank brings his ex-wife and daughter to a cabin in the woods. The demon transfers from Jones to Luke Morales.

Back in town, Ichabod joins Jenny in her car out front. She tells him the possession started not long after they saw Molloch in the woods. She would lose time and people would tell her about terrible things she'd done. After the demon left, she didn't trust herself so she would break a law to get locked up whenever she had thoughts about hurting Abbie.

At the cabin, the priest lays salt at the door threshold and blesses it with holy water. The demon in Morales can't enter. Jones finds it odd, so Morales suggests he move the salt. When Jones wipes it away, Morales grabs him and breaks his back, then walks in the house.

Back in the archives, Ichabod notices on the DVD that Jenny was in a circle of salt. They play the demon's audio backwards and Ichabod recognizes it as ancient Aramaic, saying: ""Ancitif cannot be defeated.""

They find reference to Ancitif in a book, depicting French lanterns being used to expel the demon. Ichabod recognizes it as one of several given to Benjamin Franklin on one of his voyages overseas as ambassador. Jenny recognizes it from somewhere else.

At the cabin, Morales stands watch over Macy's room. Cynthia wants to know more about the threat, but Frank doesn't want to worry her.

Abbie calls Frank with an update, he steps outside. Morales calls Frank, but it's the demon telling him his time is up. Frank races back in the house and runs into Macy's room to see her suspended in the air, possessed.

Jenny leads Abbie and Ichabod to the home of some survivalists she got the lantern for a few years ago. She knows they're heavily armed, so she suggests they steal the lantern. Abbie worries about Jenny getting caught and getting locked up again, so Abbie will steal it instead.

At the cabin, the priest tries to expel Ancitif, but his words have no effect. The demon in Macy grabs the priest and easily snaps his neck around. Ancitif demands Frank take him to the Bible. He lets Cynthia in and threatens to kill her if he doesn't.

Frank calls Abbie and asks if the Bible is still in the archives. They realize the demon must already be there and would use a host that would provide the most motivation -- Macy.

Jenny hangs back while Ichabod and Abbie sneak up on the compound and break into a barn full of supplies and relics. They find the lantern and come out of the barn, but are totally surrounded by armed survivalists.

Abbie tries to explain a child's life is at stake. When the leader quotes a verse, Crane recognizes it and tells them the war between good and evil has resumed. The survivalists are unmoved. But then Jenny appears, heavily armed. They recognize her. She gives her word they'll bring the lantern back, and the survivalists let them go.

At the archives, Frank finds the hiding place for the Bible is empty. Cynthia struggles to understand why their daughter is distorted and not herself.

Frank tries to reach through to his daughter, telling her she's strong and doesn't need fixing. The demon regains control and Ancitif throws Frank across the room.

Jenny and Abbie arrive. The demon speaks to Jenny, encouraging her to kill Abbie.

Jenny taunts Ancitif to approach her, until he's stopped by a line of salt. Ichabod pours another line behind him and comes out with the lantern.

Ancitif starts to lose hold, but shouts: ""Our plan is in motion, the witnesses can't stop it. Darkness will reign!""

Ichabod commands Ancitif back to hell and the demon flies out of Macy and into the lantern.

Macy looks up at her parents, who rush to her side.

Jenny is overwhelmed by reliving her torment again. Abbie goes to her sister and hugs her.

Back at the cabin, they retrieve the Bible where they hid it, in case Irving was tempted to turn it over.

Ichabod mixes up lemon juice and other ingredients to try to reveal invisible ink on the Bible. It says: December 18, 1799. Ichabod recognizes it as Washington's handwriting, but he supposedly died December 14, 1799. How could he have written it four days after he died? Ichabod resolves to find out."

He texts back, clumsily.

Abbie senses something in her kitchen and wheels around to see her dead colleague Andy waiting for her.

At the cabin, Ichabod tries to figure out the significance of December 18, 1799.

Ichabod remembers back to sharing a drink with General Washington, who told Ichabod he would be called upon to continue the fight in the future. ""Good will always rise, like Lazarus from his grave,"" Washington said.

Ichabod flips to a passage in Lazarus and finds something that means something to him.

Back at Abbie's, Andy tells her Moloch wants the Bible for directions it contains to something. Andy says if Abbie gives him the map, she will be spared in Moloch's new world order.

""Please don't risk your life to save Ichabod Crane. Crane will give your soul to Moloch, it is prophesied,"" Andy tells her.

Abbie remembers Ichabod having a vision that said the same thing. Andy, the rotting dead guy, tells her that no one loves her like he does. When Abbie turns her back, Andy breaks his dead fingers to escape her cuffs and sneaks off.

Abbie joins Ichabod in the archives. She tells him to answer his phone when she calls. He complains that it's an out of date flip phone. He goes on a mini-diatribe about the constant ads about upgrades being an abuse of capitalism, but he still wants a smart phone.

She agrees to let him borrow her phone for a few days and get him one just like it if he likes it.

She tells him about Andy's message, and that she was a little unnerved how Andy mentioned everyone else in her life leaving her.

Ichabod points out his find -- an extra 10 verses in Lazarus. He uses his solution to reveal the invisible ink.

The message is dated December 18, 1799 and is from Washington to Ichabod. ""Dear Sir, if you are reading this now then the war has resumed and your destiny to bear witness made manifest. Four days ago I was diagnosed by Dr. William Thorton with a fatal case of croup. As the end came, I drafted a plan. I asked that my body be kept in state, preserved by Virginia's natural winter air so that supernatural forces might aid me in a final mission. Four days ago, I died, but through the cursed prayer beads of these occult forces, I was resurrected....""

He goes on to explain that because he existed between the worlds of the living and dead, he was able to draft Ichabod a map from earth to purgatory. Ichabod realizes that with the map, he can free his wife Katrina from purgatory.

Abbie reminds him that defeating Moloch is the primary goal, which he knows.

There's a list of names that participated in the resurrection in the Bible, including Rev. Alfred Knapp, who until recently lived in Sleepy Hollow and protected the Horseman's head. His prayer beads used in the resurrection would be full of sin from the ungodly act of resurrection. Ichabod suggests they call Henry Parrish, the sin eater, to see what he can tell from the bead's history, possibly information on the map.

Captain Irving sits in an interview with Tom about the threat to his wife and daughter that lead to the death of a detective and a priest. All he can offer is that ""evil"" was responsible.

Down in the tunnels, Andy pleads to Moloch to make him a warrior in his fight, but Moloch scoffs at him. Then he sends hundreds of tiny insects which spin a web of sorts around Andy, mummifying him.

Later, Parrish meets up with Ichabod and Abbie in a cemetery. Rev. Knapp was buried with his beads wrapped around his neck, at his request. They dig up his body and Parrish can feel that the beads were used for something unnatural. The beads burn Parrish when he touches them, there's a hex on the beads. He doesn't care about the pain, he thinks it's important for the war against Moloch.

He grabs the beads again but is knocked to his feet after a moment. He saw Washington come to life and a map and Knapp in a boat along a shoreline, carrying something.

The pain to Henry makes Abbie question their current course. She wonders if during the time Ichabod was in the ground, the plan changed, and maybe entering Purgatory now will have serious consequences, like bringing about Armageddon.

Abbie asks Ichabod again if it comes down to it, can he sacrifice Katrina for the greater good.

Henry looks at his hand and it starts to heal, but a demon runs out of the dark and attacks him. Abbie and Ichabod fed off the scampering all black, hairless, long nailed demon.

Back at the archives, Parrish says something about a grave, which reminds Ichabod that Washington was a Mason and Masons were taught to take things to their grave. They think the reverend buried the map with Washington.

There are two Washington grave sites, one at Mt. Vernon and a tomb at the capital that has never been used. Ichabod thinks Washington would have wanted to be buried near Sleepy Hollow.

Parrish remembers seeing Knapp on a boat near a shoreline transporting something -- a body. There are 21 islands along the Hudson River. ""We find Washington's grave -- his real grave -- and we shall find the map buried along with him,"" Ichabod says.

Down in the tunnels, mummified Andy is reborn as a slimy, creepy, oblong-headed demon. He announces himself as Moloch's servant and swears that his enemies shall fall.

Abbie, Parrish, and Ichabod head to an island that was used as a penal colony. Ichabod is annoyed his smart phone map won't update, but he is still getting Abbie's Facebook updates.

Abbie brought maps from the archives, but Ichabod thinks his Mason's tricks will help him locate it.

Abbie checks again that they're going to discuss how to best use the map once they find it.

As Ichabod goes searching, Abbie asks Parrish if he's ever heard about a prophesy in which one witness renounces the other. He tells her about a passage written for John that says the two witnesses will prophesize for 1260 days, but ""when the beast comes up from the abyss, a witness will surrender a witness and neither will survive."" He reminds her it was rejected by those who transcribed the Bible. ""Sometimes a story is just a story,"" Parrish says.

Ichabod calls, he found a stone in the woods. He and Abbie slide it to the side and a secret grave opens in the ground.

Frank comes into the interrogation room at the station to find his ex-wife there and Tom overseeing as DNA is taken from his daughter, Macy. Forensics found DNA on the dead priest's neck. (Macy strangled him while she was possessed.)

Down in the elaborate tomb, there's a Masonic pyramid in the middle bearing the phrase ""I am the indispensable man,"" attributed to Washington. But Ichabod thinks the pyramid is not only too obvious to contain Washington, but also booby trapped.

He sees a circular plaque saying ""Cincinnatus,"" on it -- a Roman who was given power then relinquished it. He was Washington's hero, representing the idea that power should only be given to those who want it least.

Ichabod fits his Mason's ring in a small hole in the plaque and a secret wall opens and out slides Washington's casket. The angel statues around them suddenly suddenly light with fire, filling the tomb with light.

Washington's body, complete with his fake teeth, is in the casket. His skeleton is holding the map.

Ichabod gets only a minute to enjoy the discovery when demon Andy comes down the tomb stairs. Abbie fires at him but he easily grabs and crushes her gun. He tosses Ichabod aside and grabs Abbie around the neck, demanding the map.

Parrish lays a hand on him and Andy crumples, the demon side temporarily at bay. He tells Abbie to destroy the map because Moloch needs it to win the war. He begs Abbie to kill him as the demon starts to return. She picks up an ax and jams it through Andy's skull.

They hear something outside the tomb and head for another exit, out through the secret vault where Washington's casket lay.

As they're making their escape, supposedly dead Andy rises up and starts after them. Ichabod tells Abbie to shoot the booby trap on Washington's tomb. She does and the pyramid breaks apart, caving in on Andy as the other three run for it.

They escape to safety through another secret door that comes out in the forest. Abbie tells Crane what Andy said about Moloch using the map. As Ichabod stares at it, he debates. Finally, he apologizes to his wife as he lights the map on fire.

""If using this map meant betraying your trust, that's something I cannot do. Not for the world,"" he tells Abbie.

Crane tells Abbie they have free well and he chooses to forge his fate with her. ""I promise you, we are going to save her,"" Abbie says.

At the station, Frank walks purposefully as he thinks of his wife and daughter. He goes to Tom and confesses to killing the priest and Detective Jones. He turns over his badge and gun and they take him into custody.

Back at the cabin, Ichabod thinks of his wife and remembers her begging him to find her and free her, and him promising to do so. He grabs a notebook and pencil and, with his photographic memory, sets about recreating the map he just burned."

Back at the cabin, Jenny Mills assesses Ichabod's new clothes, same as his old clothes. She asks if he'll be getting rid of his coat. ""And risk it be worn ironically by purveyors of an artisanal marmalade who discovered it at a local thrift shop, I thank you, no,"" Ichabod says.

Abbie is about to go see Irving at the station, when Henry arrives and announces that he thinks that today Moloch is going to attempt to raise Hell on earth.

He saw Moloch surrounded by four white trees and he was raising a creature with a taloned hand from the dirt. He describes the Horseman, the second of the four, War. There is going to be a solar eclipse today.

Jenny mentions it's the 13 year anniversary, to the date, of when she and Abbie saw Moloch in the forest.

Abbie arrives at the station to find Irving has already been transferred upstate. He left a book for her with a note to check the marked pages.

Abbie returns to the archives, where Ichabod has found something in Washington's Bible saying a spell cast upon the dirt where the second Horseman will rise might prevent him from rising.

All the witches they know are dead, except Katrina. Ichabod reveals the map he drew to purtagory. He assures Abbie he wasn't going to use it without her.

Ichabod points to lines on a map and recalls Washington's words about a township that's a doorway between worlds.

Frank has Knapp's datebook, revealing meetings with Corbin. Abbie wants Jenny to go through the tape.

Jenny pulls her aside, incredulous that Abbie prepared to confront Moloch. But Abbie is ready to face him to reclaim their lives.

Jenny is worried about losing Abbie, but Abbie assures her she has to take on her role as a Witness and she'll be safe.

Abbie, Ichabod and Henry head to the spot in the woods that they think leads to purgatory. Ichabod expects to be able to find her in the church she visits every day. Henry warns them not to eat or drink anything while they're there or they'll become trapped.

Ichabod has an incantation from Washington's things to open the door from both sides. Henry reminds them to stay strong together over there. They recite the incantation and a mirror appears in the forest then shatters, revealing a hallway to the other side. They take hands then enter.

Abbie wakes up in the cabin with a bandage on her forehead. Sheriff Corbin and Andy Mills come in from the other room to check on her. They tell her she was in training at Quantico when she was knocked out in a line of fire exercise, which explains her confusion and memory loss.

She's thrilled to see Corbin again and hugs him. ""I'm supposed to remember something,"" she says.

Ichabod finds himself outside a university in England. Inside, his father congratulates him for his bravery in America and says that he's been granted a full professorship. Ichabod remembers his father disavowing him after he sided with the Americans, but his father says that's ridiculous and hugs him. He calls for drinks.

At the cabin, Abbie is sitting down in front of apple pie a la mode like she and Corbin used to share. Corbin and Andy dig in when Corbin says it's like old times. Abbie remembers Crane tells her they can't go back to the way things were. Abbie stands up, saying it isn't real. Her pie runs with blood.

Corbin chases after her. She sees Andy in his resurrected battered form and Corbin holding his severed head, then falls out the cabin door.

Back with his father, Ichabod remembers talking to Abbie about his father's disapproval. Ichabod realizes it's a dream.

His father turns into a demon and roars at him.

Listening to Corbin's tapes, Jenny finds a reference to a flyer Knapp had for an old church that he thinks holds answers.

Back in Purgatory, it's an all out creep show, as Ichabod is surrounded by people with no faces in a dark wood. He finds Abbie lying facedown in the forest. To reassure each other that they're the real deal -- she asks what she taught him after they trapped the Horseman. He extends his hand for a fist bump.

They make their way to the church as disfigured lost souls crawl along the ground and walls, seeking redemption.

They find Katrina in the church and give her the fast 411, but she says she can't leave Purgatory without forgiveness. The only way her soul can leave is if another takes her place. She begs them to leave before they're all trap.

Ichabod offers, but Abbie says she has to do it to finally face Moloch. He argues, but she's resolute, even though her staying essentially fulfills Moloch's prophecy.

Katrina gives Abbie an amulet to protect her from Moloch and promises to return after they've stopped War. Ichabod starts to vow he'll return, but she's sure he will. ""Remember our bond, faith,"" he says.

Ichabod teaches her the phrase to repeat, the doorway opens and they end up on the other side, where Parish is waiting.

In the forest, Moloch comes for Abbie, telling her there's no escape. She picks up a branch to take him on, but he lifts her off her feet by her throat. She rips the amulet off her neck and presses it into his skin, burning him. He drops her and she runs off.

Back in the forest, Katrina starts about trying to locate where the second Horseman will emerge. Her power is weak from lack of use, but she's able to determine the direction.

Meanwhile, Jenny arrives at the same church from Corbin's tape. It's boarded up.

Ichabod, Katrina and Parris reach the four white trees.

Jenny listens to Corbin's tapes, in which he wonders why someone would want to hide an abandoned church's name. As the eclipse begins, Jenny sees a fallen sign on the ground and uncovers it. She gets in her car and leaves Abbie a message saying she figured out Moloch's warning. ""The Saint's name is a sign -- he meant it literally, so whatever you do you can't --""

She's interrupted by a gunshot through her SUV window. The headless Horseman blocks her path and fires again. Her SUV flips over repeatedly, finally coming to a stop with her upside down inside.

Back in Purgatory, Abbie finds herself in a lifesize vesion of the dollhouse she and her sister used to play. She finds young versions of herself and Jenny.

The young version of herself tells her the reason she can't remember what happened after they saw Moloch in the woods is because he removed her memory, so she wouldn't know the truth.

In the woods, Katrina says there's nothing in the ground where the Horseman supposedly is.

Parish assures them the Horseman is there. He asks Ichabod if he knows the etymology of the word apocalypse: ""to disclose or reveal.""

Then he flings Ichabod and Katrina each against a white tree with his power and holds them there. He mocks Ichabod for being so easy to manipulate, and Abbie for wanting to believe there's a purpose to her pain.

Katrina realizes he gave her the idea to find the sin eater, a message which she relayed to Abbie. He reminds them about times he hinted about his identity, including when he was rhapsodizing about his love for good crossword puzzles ability to mislead and trick.

Parish tells them the second Horseman rose over a decade ago in the forest, and waited all this time to take form.

Back in Purgatory, young Abbie tells Abbie that it wasn't an accident Moloch was in the forest that day, and there was a reason they were sent there.

Abbie still can't remember, so young Abbie helps her remember seeing Moloch bring the second Horseman into the world -- Henry Parish.

Katrina compares Parish to Abraham, who was mortal before he became Death. ""Only half mortal. I am, after all, what you made me -- Mother and Father,"" Parish says.

He was killed by his mother's own coven and left to wither in a plain pine box. He takes out a knife and cuts his hand, bleeding on the ground, reminding them of the power of his blood. The pine box where he was buried is revealed in the dirt.

Ichabod remembers how his blood killed his son's Golem, and realizes Parish knew it would.

He didn't die, he laid in the box for two centuries, feeding on the vines that crept in, cursing those who abandoned him, until his ""true father"" came to rescue him.

Ichabod speaks to his son, calling him Jeremy, telling him Moloch is a prince of lies. Parish/Jeremy explains God sent a witness to stop him 13 years ago, but she wasn't strong enough and they defeated her, as they have again now.

In Purgatory, Abbie sees Parish is the Second Horseman and tries to figure a way out, as her young self explains Purgatory is her home now.

Henry/Jeremy explains he got his name when he wandered through the forest and the first place he saw was the church. We see the sign that Jenny found facedown: It says ""St. Henry's Parish.""

Ichabod and Katrina try to reach Jeremy, but can't. ""Now that the two Witnesses are separated, there is nothing to stop us breaking the second seal, and fulfilling the promise made long ago to an old friend,"" he says.

The Horseman/Abraham rides up and takes Katrina.

With his powers, Jeremy puts Ichabod in his old box in the ground. He removes the second seal from a leather pouch and breaks it over him.

""War isn't coming to Sleep Hollow, it's been here waiting all along. And now, it begins,"" Jeremy says. ""Good bye, father,"" he says, as the casket in the ground slams shut over a screaming Ichabod."

The king asks where they are now. and his brother tells him.

The vikings land on shore and begin to build a camp.

Lagertha is back at home deciding how to handel a situation that involves a man who says a child it is not his. The husband explains a man came to their farm stayed three days an gave advice slept with his wife and left. she asks the wife whose the father. She says she does not know. But Lagertha is determined that it was a god who had come down and lain with his wife and that he should be proud the gods chose her for this miracle. The man says nothing else.

The kings men watch from afar as the vikings continue to build their camp.

Ragnar and his brother discuss plans to attack the knights while they sleep.

Once the camp is built and the booby traps in place Ragnar and the others wait until night. Once night has fallen Ragnar and his men set fire to the camp and then attack and kill the kings troop that are camped out by the shore too. Everyone is slaughtered except for the King's brother. Ragnar does not understand why he is out fighting for his brother the king and why he does not fight. Ragnar decides He will use the King's brother for ransom in exchange for peace and gold and silver.

The king is very upset by the fact that his men are slaughtered and The bishop thinks that it is because of them straying off the path to righteousness. A man stands up an thinks it is a devil . Another thinks they are just savage men. The king asks him what should he do. the man responds with paying them off to get rid of them forever. the king is ten shown praying for his salvation. A man walks int the room and says that the are here.

Ragnar and his men ride up to the castle with the Kings brother. The knights ride out and invite him. He takes the king's brother and turns around and leaves. The knights are left speechless and full of fear.

Ragnar and his brother discuss going to talk to the king. Rollo does not believe it to be a good idea. He wants to attack the king while they are weak. He says he wants to talk because he has his brother. Rollo asks why does he think the king cares about his brother and Ragnar responds ""do I not care for mine?"" Rollo begrudgingly agrees. . The next day they are in the kings audience and being introduced . The king says he is pleased that he will talk to them. The kings advisor suggest that maybe they should feed them first before they talk and the king agrees. At dinner, the king asks what he wants for the safe return of his brother? Ragnar asks who the man in the bishops garb. The king explains he is a bishop, a man of god. Ragnar says I have one of those too. ""2000 pounds gold and silver"" says Ragnar. The king is infuriated. How much he asks twice again. King Aelle agrees but only if one of the men become baptized christian.That way the kings says he can make peace with a fellow Christian and not and enemy. Rollo volunteers himself which upsets Floki and Ragnar very much.

Back at home Siggy asks for an audience with Lagertha. He son objects since her husband tried to kill Ragnar and she explains to him why and says if Ragnar did not win she would be in her spot and she asks him what he would do. He says ""ask her to sit"". She asks to be her servant. Lagertha says it is not necessary but she insists. The monk stands up for her and says it would do her good like it did him to serve someone. Lagertha agrees and tells her from now on she is under her protection and will be looked on as a servant. Siggy is relieved.

Back at the kings Rollo is being baptized at the river. After the baptisim the king asks Ragnar and his men to return to ship and to give him back his brother while he gets the gold and silver together.

Later Lagertha's daughter comes into her mothers room in the middle of the night. She is afraid of her father being so far away. Lagertha comforts her. Her daughter then asks how does she know it's a boy? Lagertha says it is because the seer had foretold it. She then falls asleep on her mother.

Back at camp Rollo is cracking jokes about be christian. Floki tells him he renounced the gods in front of everyone and he risks the wrath of the gods. Soon someone in camp yells that ""they're here."" A cart is being put down in front of the camp. Ragnar sends some men to look at it and they reveal it is empty. Emerging from the trees is the king's men. The vikings stand and begin to slaughter the king's army that was sent to kill them even though they are clearly outnumbered. Rollo especially tries hard to kill as many Christians as he can in order to denounce Christianity. The old viking dies in battle just like he wanted so he could go to Valhalla. After Rollo is done slaughtering the ones that were standing He then begins to slaughter the ones that are still moving on the ground. Everyone is speechless as they watch him slaughter After he is done, he yells at Floki "" How many Christians did I kill Floki? How many? Is Odin still angry with me now? ""

Ragnar thinks the king does not The king's brother tries to talk to Ragnar about letting him talk to his brother. He the says he will persuade him to hold up his end of the bargain. He says ""why should i notjust kill you now?"" the king's brother tells that he will lose his bargaining chip. He holds up his axe and says he has this.

Heading to the kings castle is a horse pulling something behind it. It stops at the gates. It is the king's brother tied up to boards and dead.

Siggy is seen walking to Lagertha's bedroom.. She enters and sees bloody towels on the floor. Her eyes the shift to Lagertha covered in blood and her stomach is flat. She lost the baby. Siggy goes over to comfort her and hold her. Ragnar heads back with his money while the king vows war eternal with him and he will avenge himself, bring him to justice and bring him to death. Ragnar waves goodbye from his boat with a sly smile."

""You're about to meet a hypochondriac. Witness Mr. Walter Bedeker, age forty-four, afraid of the following: death, disease, other people, germs, drafts, and everything else. He has one interest in life, and that's Walter Bedeker. One preoccupation: the life and well-being of Walter Bedeker. One abiding concern about society: that if Walter Bedeker should die, how will it survive without him?""

Walter Bedeker (David Wayne) is a rather argumentative and egotistical man who feels that the world (from doctors to germs to his wife) wants him dead. However, in Walter's mind, he is too important a person to die (even though he seems to have very little to offer the world except in the way of snide criticism).

After a doctor visits him and finds nothing wrong with him, Walter dismisses the doctor as a 'quack,' and goes back to his train of thought that his death will come soon. Walter ponders why man has to die in such a short span compared to how long the Earth has existed, pondering why man can't live longer than 100 years, or even 1,000 years.

Walter's ponderings are soon interrupted when a man named Mr. Cadwallader (Thomas Gomez), an impeccably-dressed, jovial fat man who also happens to be the Devil, appears by his bedside. Cadwallader soon explains that he is willing to give Walter immortality in exchange for his soul. However, Walter isn't so eager to say yes, and agrees under certain conditions. Cadwallader agrees to give Walter immortality and indestructibility, as well as the inability to age. Cadwallader also promises Walter an escape clause to their deal: if at any time he tires of life, all he needs to do is summon Cadwallader. Walter smiles smugly at the jovial man as if he were crazy, and signs a contract for their deal.

Walter first tests his newfound indestructibility by placing his hands on a nearby heater. When his hands emerge unscathed, he eagerly leaves the apartment. Walter soon uses his newfound indestructibility as a way to claim accident claims by throwing himself in front of busses and trains. However, after surviving 14 incidents with only his suit showing wear and tear (and numerous checks paid out to him by the transit companies), Walter has now grown bored.

His wife has grown concerned, and when Walter attempts to poison himself (and lives), demands to know what is going on. Walter explains his deal with Cadwallader, but his wife refuses to believe it. Turning a deaf ear to his wife's plea to seek mental help, Walter rushes to the roof of their building, intent to get a thrill out of throwing himself off the top of it. His wife follows and tries to get him to stop, but ends up accidentally falling off the roof herself. Walter then casually strolls back to the apartment, and calls the Police, claiming he has murdered his wife.

Walter is taken away, and placed on trial. His defense attorney soon grows exasperated when it seems that Walter's actions in court will send him directly to the electric chair for his wife's murder. Unknown to the lawyer, Walter is savoring the thrill of being electrocuted and surviving.

However, when the sentencing is read, Walter's expectant glee turns to shock when the Judge delivers a sentence of life imprisonment instead. Walter is returned to his holding cell, awaiting transfer to prison. A guard delivers his meal, and snidely proclaims that Walter will probably last 20-50 years in prison before he dies.

Walter soon summons Cadwallader, and wishes to use his escape clause. Cadwallader then causes Walter to pitch over and die of a heart attack, claiming the egotistical man's soul.

Closing narration:

""There's a saying, 'Every man is put on Earth condemned to die, time and method of execution unknown.' Perhaps this is as it should be. Case in point: Walter Bedeker, lately deceased, a little man with such a yen to live. Beaten by the Devil, by his own boredom--and by the scheme of things in this, the Twilight Zone."""

""Witness if you will a dungeon, made out of mountains, salt flats and sand that stretch to infinity. The dungeon has an inmate: James A. Corry. And this is his residence: a metal shack.

Confinement in this case stretches as far as the eye can see, because this particular dungeon in on an asteroid nine million miles from Earth. Now witness if you will a man's mind and body shrivelling in the sun, a man dying of loneliness.""

Allenby (John Dehner), the captain of a supply ship that travels the solar system, takes pity on Corry (Jack Warden), who's serving a fifty-year sentence for murder, and leaves him a box containing Alicia (Jean Marsh), a robot that looks and sounds exactly like a woman. Initially, Corry is repelled by the robot, but eventually his heart melts and he falls deeply in love with her. Eleven months pass. Then one day, the supply ship lands. Allenby tells Corry he's received a full pardon, and that they've come to get him. But there's a hitch: Corry can only take fifteen pounds of gear, and Alicia weighs more than that. Corry refuses to leave her behind, claiming that she's a woman. Reluctantly, Allenby draws his gun and shoots Alicia full in the face, revealing a mass of smolderingwires. He tells Corry, ""All you're leaving behind is loneliness."" Stunned, Corry replies, ""I must remember that. I must remember to keep that in mind.""

Closing narration:

""On a microscopic piece of sand that floats through space is a fragment of a man's life. Left to rust is the place he lived in and the machines he used. Without use, they will disintegrate from the wind and the sand and the years that act upon them; all of Mr. Corry's machines--including the one made in his image, kept alive by love, but now obsolete... in the Twilight Zone."""

He is consistently harrassed by his wife, customers and boss for his love of print to the point that he must sneak into the bank's vault where he works to read on his lunch hour. During one such visit, a nuclear bomb blast levels his city, leaving him unscathed, whereupon he exits to find that he has ""time enough at last"" to read all he wants when he finds the local library's contents scattered about.

""Twelve o'clock noon. An ordinary scene, an ordinary city. Lunchtime for thousands of ordinary people. To most of them, this hour will be a rest, a pleasant break in the day's routine. To most, but not all. To Edward Hall, time is an enemy, and the hour to come is a matter of life and death.""

Hall (Richard Conte), a man with a cardiac condition, has sought out the aid of Dr. Rathmann (John Larch), a psychiatrist. He explains that he's been dreaming in chapters, as if in a movie serial. In his dream, Maya (Suzanne Lloyd), a carnival dancer, lures him into a funhouse and onto a roller coaster with the express intention of scaring him to death. If he goes to sleep, he knows he'll return to the dream and will have a fatal heart attack. On the other hand, if he stays awake much longer, the strain will be too much for his heart. Realizing that Rathmann can't help him, he starts to go, but stops when he realizes that the doctor's receptionist is a dead ringer for the girl in his dream. Terrified, he runs back into Rathmann's office and jumps out the window to his death. The doctor calls the receptionist into his office--where Hall lies on the couch, his eyes closed. Rathmann tells the receptionist that Hall came in, lay down, immediately fell asleep--and then a few moments later, let out a scream and died.

Closing narration:

""They say a dream only takes a second or so, and yet in that second a man can live a lifetime. He can suffer and die, and who's to say which is the greater reality: the one we know or the one in dreams, between heaven, the sky, the earth...in the Twilight Zone."""

Duly recorded on this ship's log is the sailing time, course to destination, weather conditions, temperature, longitude and latitude. But what is never recorded in a log is the fear that washes over a deck like fog and ocean spray. Fear like the throbbing strokes of engine pistons, each like a heartbeat, parceling out every hour into breathless minutes of watching, waiting, and dreading. For the year is 1942, and this particular ship has lost its convoy. It travels alone like an aged blind thing groping through the unfriendly dark, stalked by unseen periscopes of steel killers. Yes, the Queen of Glasgow is a frightened ship, and she carries with her a premonition of death.""

On board the Glasgow is a German named Carl Lanser (Nehemiah Persoff), with no memory of how he got there, yet with the feeling that he's met all the passengers somewhere before. Things are made even more mysterious by Lanser's certainty that an enemy sub is stalking the ship, and by his premonition that something is going to happen at 1:15 a.m. His fear provides correct: at one-fifteen a U-boat surfaces. Peering through binoculars, Lanser sees that its captain is...himself! The U-boat sinks the helpless freighter, then crew members machine-gun the survivors. Lanser sinks beneath the waters. Later on board the sub, a lieutenant suggests they might all face damnation for their action. Kapitan Lanser discounts this theory--not realizing that he is, in fact, doomed to relive the sinking of that ship for eternity.

Closing narration:

""The S.S. Queen of Glasgow, heading for New York, and the time is 1942. For one man, it is always 1942--and this man will ride the ghost of that ship every night for eternity. This is what is meant by paying the fiddler. This is the comeuppance awaiting every man when the ledger of his life is opened and examined, the tally made, and then the reward or the penalty paid. And in the case of Carl Lanser, former Kapitan Lieutenant, Navy of the Third Reich, this is the penalty. This is the justice meted out. This is judgment night in the Twilight Zone."""

It disappeared from the radar screen for 24 hours.

Lieutenant Colonel Clegg Forbes is at the hospital outside the room of his fellow crewmate, Major William Gart. When a nurse approaches him Clegg asks her if Gart is still there and the nurse, surprised, says that he is. Clegg goes into Gart's room, and Gart says that he feels fine. Clegg looks around and says that the ship is fine and they put it under wraps. Gart says that Clegg doesn't look well, and Clegg lights a cigarette, his hand shaking.

Clegg shuts the door and says that he wants to asks some questions to get oriented. He asks Gart when he left there, and then says that he walked out with someone. Gart says that Clegg didn't leave with anyone, and Clegg shows him a newspaper with a headline of the two of them in the crash. The photo shows the two of them. Clegg goes over how that blacked out when the ship disappeared, then says that there three of them, and Colonel Ed Harrington was the three. They brought the three of them to the hospital, and only Gart had a broken leg while the other two only had scratches. The doctors discharged Clegg and Harrington. Gart says that he doesn't know anyone named Harrington, only two of them went up, and Harrington left alone.

When Gart says that he should have someone look at him, Clegg goes over everything that happened, repeating Gart's exact words to Harrington.

-----

The previous day, Harrington jokes with Gart and then leaves with Clegg. There's a newspaper there talking about three men and a photo of all three of them.

Harrington and Clegg to a bar, and the bartender recognizes them and says the drinks are on the house. A woman chats with Clegg, and Harrington looks at himself in the mirror over the bar. He stares and both Clegg and the bartender notices. Harrington drops his beer and clutches at his head, and tells Clegg that he feels like he doesn't belong there and he'd disappear if he let himself go. Harrington takes a drink that the bartender brings him and then goes to call his folks. He goes to a phone booth and makes the call.

A few minutes later, Harrington staggers out of the booth and calls Clegg over. He says that he called his parents and his mother told him that he didn't have a son. Harrington's father got on the phone, also said he didn't have a son, and told Harrington to get off the phone. Harrington feels like he isn't there, and it feels like they shouldn't have come back from the flight and something or someone let them come back when it shouldn't have.

Clegg goes to get Harrington a drink, picks up a newspaper from a table, and sees that it now says that only two men went up. He goes to the phone booth and discovered that Harrington is gone. Clegg goes back to the bar and notices that Harrington's glass is gone. The bartender and the woman have no memory of Harrington, and the bartender says that Clegg came in there alone. Clegg yells that the bartender is crazy and storms out.

A panicked Clegg goes home and calls the air force base. The commanding officer is out and he hangs up. His girlfriend Amy comes in, and Clegg says that he's in trouble. Amy complains that Clegg didn't pick her up at the bus station, and then realizes that Clegg is upset. He says that he wired her to come, takes out the wire, but it has no mention of Harrington like he remembers it. Amy doesn't know who Harrington is, even when Clegg says that they double-dated a hundred times.

Clegg's commanding office calls, and Clegg talks to him. When he says Harrington, the general says that he doesn't remember Harrington, then breaks into tears and hangs up. Then Clegg chuckles and figures that it's a gag, and Harrington is still at the bar. Clegg goes back there and calls through the doors to Harrington, then breaks in and plaintively calls to his crewmate, and begs him to show himself. He falls into the booth and begs Harrington to come back.

-----

Clegg tells Gart that he ran down the street afterward, and doesn't know what happened to Amy. Gart says that he never heard of Harrington and he must be an illusion. Clegg insists that Harrington isn't an illusion and was yanked away by whatever made a mistake and let them go through when they shouldn't have gotten back. He figures that it feels like he doesn't belong, goes to the room's mirror, sees that his reflection isn't there, yells that he doesn't want it to happen, and runs out of the room. Gart goes out but there's no sign of Clegg, and the nurse has never heard of Clegg. Now there's only one bed in the room instead of three, and the nurse helps Gart to his bed. The newspaper says that Gart was the only astronaut who went up.

Major Henderson comes back, and the nurse tells him that the ward is empty. They check the room, and there's no beds there.

The X-20 disappears from the hangar, and no one remembers it or the crew."

The ship is soon found to have crashed on an unknown world. Of the crew, only three are in decent conditon: Donlin, Pierson, & Corey. Of the three, Corey is desperate for survival, and shuns Donlin's giving water to a 4th crew member, whose condition is critical. Eventually, the 4th member succumbs to his wounds.

During this time, Pierson surmises that given the height of the sun, they must be close to Earth. However, Donlin surmises that their chance of rescue is nil, as the space agency had only create the one craft they were in.

Donlin then has Pierson and Corey go off on a scouting mission, to find life, water, or anything. As night falls, Corey returns. He tells Donlin that He and Pierson parted ways to search, but when Donlin sees Corey taking a large swig from his canteen, he suspects foul play.

Donlin gets Corey to confess that he took Pierson's canteen, and left him to die. At gunpoint, Donlin has Crey lead them back to Pierson, only to find him having crawled a ways away.

Donlin puts down his weapon, and with his last strength, Pierson attempts to point out what he saw on an upper ridge some ways off. He draws two small horizontal lines, but expires as he draws a long vertical line through them.

Donlin attempts to climb up the ridge, when Corey grabs his gun, claiming that he wants Donlin's canteen. Donlin once again speaks out against Corey's actions, but is shot. However, the bullet not only kills Donlin, but punctured his canteen, leaving Corey with only his canteen.

He attempts to climb the ridge, whose path is filled with loose rocks. When he gets to the top, a look of pain and shock spreads across his face. Down below, he sees what Pierson was attempting to draw: telephone poles. Their ship had gone up, and crashed back to Earth, in the Southwestern desert of the United States."

In a fit of cowardice, one of the British pilots, Lt. Terrance Decker (Kenneth Haigh) flees, abandoning his comrade, Capt. Alexander Mackaye, (Robert Warwick) alone to a certain death at the hands of the enemy planes, with no possibility of help from their squadron. Decker flies through a strange white cloud, then he descends and lands at an American air force base with highly advanced planes and equipment. He is taken into custody and discovers that, somehow, he has travelled into the future, to 1959. Of course, the base commander believes this to be a prank or hoax, thinking that Decker is either deranged or on some secret mission. While under interrogation, Decker learns, incredibly, that his comrade not only survived 42 years before, but went on to save many lives during WWII. In fact, now Air Vice Marshall Mackaye is on his way to the base for inspection. Decker reveals that he had, long ago, secretly nicknamed Mackaye ""Old Leadbottom"" for embarrassing injuries sustained earlier. The base commander hopes that, once Mackaye sees Decker, that this mystery will be resolved. Decker, at first, doesn't want to see Mackaye for fear he'll be discredited as a coward. But then he realizes that perhaps the only way ""Mack"" could have survived is if he somehow got help while fighting those German planes. Decker suddenly realizes that maybe he was brought into the future for a purpose, to learn that Mackaye did, in fact, survive. The base commander scoffs at this idea but Decker seizes upon the opportunity to redeem himself and save Mackaye so all those other lives could be saved as well. He escapes in his plane and flies away seeking that same white cloud. In the meantime, Mackaye arrives at the base and is asked if he knows Lt. Decker. Mackaye recalls fondly how he and Terry Decker encountered enemy planes while flying together but then Decker appeared to fly away, leaving him alone. But then, suddenly out of nowhere, Decker reappeared with his guns blazing and destroyed several German planes before being killed while saving Mackaye's life. When shown Decker's personal effects kept at the base, Mackaye demands to know what the hell is going on. The base commander says ""You better sit down, Old Leadbottom!"""

As the neighbors continue to talking, one neighbor's car starts on it's own. The group instantly grow suspicious of the man and his family. The owner of the car denies any knowledge as to why this is happening, but few are seldom to believe him.

The blame keeps getting passed around, as someone reports of a neighbor who stares up at the sky on some nights, looking for something, as well as tinkering with something in his basement.

As night settles, a dark figure is seen coming towards the group. One man takes a rifle and shoots the figure, who crumples to the ground. Upon further inspection, it is revealed that the figure was another neighbor, who had supposedly left the street to see if anyone over in nearby streets was experiencing the same issues.

The shooter is soon looked on with suspicion: why was he so quick to fire that gun? The person who fired the gun is then further surprised when his house's lights turn on by themselves. Several people attempt to stone him, before he crazily yells that he believes the alien to be the boy from before, who talked of aliens.

As the panic rises, lights and machines all along the street begin turning on and off, sending the once simple people into a mad panic, placing blame on each other and causing chaos.

On a hilltop some distance away, two aliens observe the panic, explaining to the other that mankind is very easy panic, and that they can just as easily turn on the other, which will make domination over their species by the aliens rather easy."

Roger is so obsessed that he continues to dial her number until she picks up the phone. When she finally does, she tolerates his protestations, but does not return his affection. After she hangs up, a person waiting for the telephone forces Roger out so he can make an emergency call. As Roger tries to protest, the man gives Roger a business card, informing him that the person listed on it can help solve the problems that the man overheard through the phone booth.

Roger takes the card, and goes to the residence of a Professor Daemon. The Professor is an old man who has very little patience for quibbles, and wants to know why Roger is there. When the Professor asks Roger if he seeks wealth or power, Roger simply mentions that he just wants Leila to love him. The answer bores the Professor, but he assures Roger that he can make Leila love him with the use of a love potion. The Professor hints that this may be a bad idea, but Roger is too excited to listen to him. Roger eagerly buys the Professor's potion for $1, and hurries off.

Roger soon after arrives at Leila's apartment with some flowers and champagne. Even though she doesn't want to see him, she is willing to take him up on his offer for just having a glass of champagne. As she freshens up, Roger pours the potion into her glass. Soon after drinking it, Leila falls madly in love with Roger. The two are wed shortly thereafter.

6 months later, Roger has grown a bit exasperated over the potion's effects. Just as the Professor promised, Leila loves Roger passionately, and does everything she can to please him. Feeling at the end of his rope, Roger returns to the Professor's residence. Roger tries to act like everything is perfectly fine, but the Professor soon gets him to admit that he's going out of his mind with how stifling Leila's love for him is. Roger asks the Professor if Leila's love could be controlled or tempered, but the Professor says that the only way to end the desires is with a special potion of his, that he calls 'The Glove Cleaner.' The potion is an untraceable, painless, tasteless poison that Daemon offers to sell Roger for $1000. Roger is upset to lose all his savings, but finally relents. The Professor warns Roger that he must administer the potion without hesitation: if he loses his nerve, he'll never be able to administer 'The Glove Cleaner' again. As Roger leaves the Professor's house, the old man says sagely to himself: ""Always the same way. First the stimulant... then the chaser.""

Roger returns home with some champagne to administer 'The Glove Cleaner' with. Roger asks Leila to light some candles, which distracts her as he administers the potion to her glass. Just as he is about to give her the poisoned champagne, she coyly reveals to him that she's pregnant. The shock causes Roger to drop the glasses, spilling the potion. Roger mutters to himself that he couldn't have gone through with it anyway. As Roger's head falls back in a daze, Leila cuddles close, and lovingly reminds him that they'll be together for the rest of their lives."
