https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2312764/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"Sherlock Holmes, fresh out of rehab, is teamed with a sobriety partner, a former surgeon named Watson. They have to learn to work together even as they tackle their first case, the mysterious death of a doctor's wife.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Michael Cuesta'],"['', '']",[],"['one word title', 'pacifier behaviour', 'non haptic communication', 'serial killer', 'therapy']",[],"""Elementary"" - ""Pilot"" - Sept. 27, 2012

In slow motion, a glass drops and shatters, a red haired woman is pursued through a house, up a staircase, and into a bedroom. On the bed she struggles to reach for something behind the lamp.

Sherlock Holmes (Jonny Lee Miller) is fresh out of rehab and all tatted up. He has been given an ultimatum by his wealthy father: stay sober and he can stay in the rundown--but still fabulous-- brownstone in NYC that his father owns. (It is one of many and not the best but still, a fabulous brownstone.)

His father has hired Joan Watson (Lucy Liu) as his sober companion. She is a whipsmart former surgeon, who, we learn through Holmes' deductions and Google skills, lost a patient and subsequently her medical license.

Holmes, quirky to say the least, wants no part of this sober companionship. When she first arrives he is watching a whole bunch of televisions in his house. He stops Watson dead in her tracks with a serious, eye-to-eye declaration about true love at first sight. He then clicks one of the paused TVs and reveals he has just repeated verbatim a schmaltzy monologue from a soap. She's so flustered she drops her purse, which will be important later.

She says his dad hired her and where he goes, she goes, but he can introduce her however he wants to protect his sobriety anonymity. So off they go, naturally, to a crime scene where he introduces her to police captain Gregson (Aidan Quinn) as his ""valet."" Gregson explains to Watson that when he was in London doing some post-9/11 stuff, Holmes was helping Scotland Yard as a consultant and his sleuthing skills blew Gregson away. Now that Holmes is in NYC they plan to use his services.

The case is a missing woman reported by her husband. It looks like the door was kicked in, there are glass shards in the kitchen, and there was a struggle in the bedroom. This is the home of the red-haired woman. Holmes deduces she knew her attacker because there were two broken glasses-- something overlooked by the police-- and the blood in the footprint on the door shows it was left afterward by someone who wanted it to look like it was busted down. Holmes also figures out that there was a panic room in the house. He finds the button behind the lamp and it reveals the red-haired woman lying in a pool of blood, dead on the floor. The husband, apparently, didn't know about the panic room.

The husband, of course, is questioned at first but his feet are too small for the footprint and his hand too small to have left the choking marks around his wife's neck. (A fact confirmed by former doctor Watson in a show of observation that Holmes clearly appreciates.)

Together the pair chase down more leads and come upon a flower delivery man who they think might be a serial killer attracted to red-haired women. Once it looks like they've got it all sewn up, the flower guy turns up dead of an apparent suicide and his cell phone is missing. At his house, a washing machine is turned over with clothes spilling out of it, and a glance at his pantry includes a bag of rice on the door.

The cops still think they have their guy but it's not sitting right with Holmes. The flower guy had been going to see a psychiatrist and recording his sessions. Then his shrink died and there is no record of seeing another doctor even though it was clear the flower guy was very disturbed. Holmes begins to suspect the husband again because he is also a psychiatrist and the flower guy was obsessed with redheads. He notices that the wife had once been a pretty blonde with a mole but when she died she was a flaming redhead who had undergone extensive plastic surgery.

Meanwhile, Holmes is trying to put off Watson by dimestore psychoanalyzing her past, unplugging her alarm clocks, and basically saying he will pay her to go away. He pisses her off so much at one point that she leaves to go to an opera she had planned for them to attend together. Full of new revelations, Holmes shows up, is generally a loud pain in the ass, and convinces her to leave to continue work on the case.

Holmes and Watson confront the husband again and Holmes lays out his theory that he wanted to off his very wealthy wife but couldn't do it himself. He had been treating flower guy who was obsessed with redheads and violent. So he started making his wife get plastic surgery and dye her hair. He started ordering flowers for her every week so the flower guy would see her and become obsessed. Instead of prescribing sedatives, he gave him steroids to agitate him. He basically made the guy into a loaded weapon aimed at his wife. The smug doctor basically admits this is true but knows Holmes has no evidence so he blows him off. Holmes promptly gets into Watson's car and rams the doctor's fancy sports car and is arrested.

When Watson comes to see him in jail he apologizes for wrecking her car and generally being an ass. She asks him what happened in London that sent him to rehab. He answers that it's a false premise that if she knows something personal about him that they will be closer. She notes that he has very few mirrors in his house, she thinks this is because he knows a lost cause when he sees one.

The next day they confront the doctor in Gregson's office. Holmes breaks it down: when he saw the overturned washer and noticed the missing cell phone he realized what happened. When Watson noticed the bag of rice in his pantry, even though she saw in his medical records that he was allergic to rice, she helped put two and two together. The flower guy accidentally washed his cell phone, ruining it. In a rage he overturned the washer. He then went to the store and bought some rice, which can act as a dessicant and save waterlogged electronics. Holmes produces the phone and hits a button: out comes the sound of a therapy session that flower guy recorded with the smug doctor as his shrink. Bullseye.

Later, back at the brownstone Holmes and Watson are planning to go to dinner but Watson wants to finish watching the Mets game. Holmes succinctly predicts how the last three at bats are going to go and how the game will end with a double play and says he'll wait for her downstairs. The game then ends precisely this way much to Watson's aggravation. They head out to dinner."

Holmes and Watson are at an AA-type meeting with a man sharing. When Watson notices Holmes zoned out she touches his shoulder and he jumps up shouting ""Amygdala!""

Turns out he's not into the whole 12 step thing, or really anything crowding his brain he doesn't deem ""necessary"" information so he puts himself in a trance when confronted with the unnecessary. He does this by internally chanting a mantra: amygdala.

They get a call from Gregson and head to the crime scene. A man has been shot in the head in an apartment building. He's a cop's brother so they have their best people on it including a young detective named Bell. They believe it was a robbery homicide. But with a few quick glances Holmes deduces it was a robbery AND a homicide committed by two different people.

He figures the robbery was done by a strong man because he notices a piece of furniture missing. He pins it quickly on the neighbor who called 911. The shooter on the other hand is still unknown but Holmes, after sniffing the chair where the shot originated, realizes it was a woman based on the remnant fragrances of her deodorant.

Back at the precinct house Bell is trying to get the neighbor to cop to the murder but he won't. And of course it's because he isn't the shooter as Holmes points out again to Gregson. He gets heated and Watson sends him to get some chips. She asks Gregson if he was like this before in London. Gregson says he was a pain in the ass but really good. He also notes that Holmes called him recently to get back to work, saying he was calling from Heathrow. Watson notes this.

Bell joins them and Holmes argues that a sketch artist should be brought in since the neighbor says he passed a woman on the stairs. Bell protests saying the neighbor overheard ""Harry Potter"" (Holmes) mention a woman and made it up. Gregson asks for one anyway saying Holmes might be wrong but he wants to check it out.

On their way out Watson says she's meeting a friend and Holmes deduces it's a male friend that is probably an ex that she might sleep with. He tells her she should since it will improve her mood.

Turns out Holmes was right as Watson meets with her ex, Ty, an assistant district attorney. He misses her and worries about her babysitting drug addicts and says if she's doing it as penance for losing a patient, she shouldn't. She says she does it because she's good at it. He notes her parents have reached out said she isn't returning their calls. She says she doesn't want to be lectured all the time.

The next morning Holmes notices on the autopsy that the dead guy had a special genetic condition that clouded his cornea. Watson wonders why it's relevant and Holmes says why not?

Bell calls them to a hospital. He has found the woman from the sketch. Unfortunately, she's been in a coma for three days having tried to commit suicide so she couldn't have killed the dead guy. Bell thanks Holmes for his help and says he'll take it from here.

Watson and Holmes stay behind to make sure the woman isn't faking. She isn't. But Holmes deduces that she has a twin thanks to the inscription on a book by her bed. They track down the twin but it's a dead end because she's fraternal.

Later at home, as Holmes practices lock picking, Watson unearths an old violin and encourages him to play as a form of therapy. He doesn't want to. She gets a call from Ty. As she answers, Holmes puts the violin in a trash can and sets it on fire. Watson, alarmed, throws a blanket over it but her ex is confused.

Holmes gets a call from Gregson and they head to another scene. A woman shot in the head with the same gun, by a seated shooter wearing the same deodorant. They also notice she has the same genetic corneal issue. Through DNA they figure out the first dead guy and the woman were half siblings with the same father. They didn't know each other and their families didn't know about them. Their mothers are dead and the families aren't helping.

Holmes, Watson, Bell and Gregson run down an investigator who was following the girl. Turns out Gregson knows him from their old days in the department. He says he can't tell them anything because it's to do with a case. Holmes pulls the guy out of the room and says he can tell he's been taking methamphetamines to stay awake and that his stash is nearby so unless he wants to get busted by the police he better help. The guy decides to simple ""leave this file"" on his desk and go to the bathroom.

Holmes and the gang head back to the fraternal twin who hired the detectives to investigate the victims. Turns out the victims were sired out of wedlock by the twins' dad and stood to inherit a fortune. Holmes theorizes the sisters had them investigated to figure out how to kill them. The woman says they only wanted to find out what kind of people they were, but before she and her sister could decide what to do her sister tried to commit suicide. Holmes implies that she tried to kill her sister to get even more of the inheritance. She slaps him and says she'd never hurt her sister. Bell and Gregson take her away but Holmes asks one more question: why go to all the trouble of dressing up like her sister, wig, deodorant, make-up to commit the crimes? She says he's insane.

They return to the brownstone and find Ty waiting for them with a bottle of wine in hand. He says Watson emailed him to come to the house for a dinner party. She shoos him off. Holmes hacked her email. He throws back in her face what she said about opening up to each other. He tells her smirkingly they don't have to be friends, they just have to get through the next five weeks and go their separate ways.

Watson drags Holmes to another meeting. But this time he listens, and as a woman shares about having an affair with a married doctor and using him to get drugs, Holmes has an epiphany. He charges out and Watson wants to know what's up. He says there isn't time. She says maybe they won't be friends but they need to trust each other so he has to let her in a bit.

They go to coma twin's hospital room and the other twin is reading to her. Holmes calls the awake twin a murderer and claims there is a third half sibling she didn't know about but that he will be protecting her himself at the address that he gives with her name. He then shoves Bell, who arrests him.

At the address Holmes gave, a woman is returning home. Someone else follows behind her into the house. As she's about to attack the police swoop in. It was all a trap of course. But the twist is that

it's coma sister holding the gun.

At the precinct Holmes explains that he realized coma sister enlisted her doctor for help. When they learned of the other heirs and her sister wanted to share, the doctor and coma sister came up with this elaborate plan: suicide attempt, coma to cover their tracks. He kept her in a medically induced coma when he wasn't around to fool everyone and woke her up to commit the murders. Awake sister wants to help coma sister even though she's a murderer. Holmes points out an important detail: why was coma sister still in a coma? She had killed all the heirs they knew about. Ah; that's right, she was going to kill her own sister. Oh, snap.

Case closed, Bell offers sincere thanks and Gregson invites Holmes and Watson for a drink. He takes a raincheck.

Back at the brownstone, over take out, Watson points out that Holmes listening in the meeting actually helped crack the case. He grudgingly thanks her. She asks if he ever thinks what he's doing is a form of penance without even knowing it. He says you have to know it, otherwise it isn't penance.

Later that night, while Watson is in bed upstairs, Holmes unearths another violin and begins to play."

A man who knows him pulls up beside him and offers him a ride. Adam gets in. The man leaves a bunch of balloons that say ""thank you"" for the boy's parents.

Present Watson finds Holmes has been up all night going through his old serial killer case files, he's called ""Balloon man."" Holmes heard about another abduction on his police scanner last night and is waiting to be called in. His phone rings.

On the scene, he learns the perp forced the lock on the girl's bedroom window and took her, leaving balloons. Her dad was at a bodega getting wine and her mom was at an art gallery opening. Holmes notices freshly broken ivy, presumably by the girl, Marianna Castillo.

""That's good, she's a fighter,"" says Detective Bell. ""If little girls could actually win fights against grown men then, yea, it would be cause for great optimism,"" Holmes says.

Inside, Holmes is aghast to find her parents are about to do a live TV plea for their daughter. He paints the camera to stop it then explains that the children the killer kept alive the longest were directly correlated to their parents' media exposure. ""The more interviews, the faster the children died,"" he says.

If they want their daughter back, they just have to listen to him, Holmes says.

Holmes goes through the parents' fridge and finds a bottle of wine. He confronts Mr. Castillo, knowing it wasn't labeled as bodegas do. There are two of many kitchen items and forwarded mail, so he thinks they split and got back together. There was also an incoming call from a Long Island number right before he left the house last night.

He confesses the coworker he had an affair with called, saying she was in the neighborhood. He went to the street to talk to her.

Holmes wants to talk to her, thinking she might have seen the suspect.

At the station, Captain Gregson talks to the mistress, Lori Thompson. Holmes informs Watson that in situations such as these that require his total concentration, she shouldn't talk to him unless he talks to her. Lori remembers a car running a stop sign and nearly hitting her.

Holmes deduces that the suspect got sloppy this time, usually he chloroforms his victims and Marianna was awake to break the ivy. He thinks it was because of the sirens. On the scanner, he heard a call right before the kidnapping of a domestic dispute two blocks away. Balloon Man must have thought the sirens were for him and sped off.

Lori saw the van, it was dark brown.

Holmes, Watson and Bell head to the neighborhood to look for more clues. As she worries that he hasn't eaten all day, he explains that talking about the case as she listens helps him draw connections he might not have otherwise.

He sees a car with multiple parking tickets, meaning it's been there for days. It's been sideswiped by a brown vehicle that was previously painted blue and white. He thinks it's a decommissioned NYPD van.

At the station, Holmes assures Watson her listening is a valuable service. For a while in London he talked only to a phrenology bust he kept in his study. He named him ""Angus.""

They get a hit on the BOLO for the van and find and follow it. The driver takes off and they give chase. The driver gets out and runs and Bell easily catches him. The van is empty.

The person Bell tackled is too young to be Balloon Man. Holmes recognizes a birthmark on his neck and realizes it's Balloon Man's first victim, Adam.

Back at the station, Adam isn't talking. They think he might have begun to sympathize with his captor. They wonder how much he might have helped Balloon Man with his killings.

Holmes asks for permission to talk to Adam.

He tells Adam he understands the man who took him also took care of him, taught him to drive and loved him. Sherlock tells him about being bulled in boarding school and how eventually he came to feel gratitude to his bully for paying attention to him, ""in tormenting me, he was attempting to correct what I knew to be wrong with myself."" He even covered for him.

He asks how Adam got a cut on his hand, he says it was from trying to open a window in his room.

Adam finally starts talking about how the man cares for him, evening bringing him donuts every morning. Gregson interrupts the interview, Adam's parents called a lawyer for him.

Adam's parents know the police suspect him. They're trying to get him immunity with the DA.

Holmes pulls Gregson aside and suggests that from what Adam said he now knows Balloon Man works nights. Holmes goes home with his old case files, determined to stay up all night. Waston offers to help. She shows him a squat exercise to help him stay awake.

In the morning, Holmes wakes Watson up. The early victims had all had their houses fumigated, but when the FBI checked into the employees, none were suspicious. Holmes thinks Balloon Man changed jobs. Recent victims' families or neighbors all had subscriptions to the same business newspaper.

He gets the delivery man's name from the company. Samuel Abbott.

Holmes and Watson wait in the van as teams bust into Abbott's apartment. It's totally empty, without furniture. But there's a bunch of balloons for the police that say ""Congrats!"" There's a flash drive attached. It has a recorded message from Abbott, confessing to killing six people and saying if he doesn't get his ""son"" Adam back by tomorrow, he'll kill Marianna.

Gregson catches the Castillos up on things. Mrs. Castillo asks Adam, who is 19, what he wants. Holmes points out that abuse victims are sometimes protective of their abusers, but it doesn't mean they should be reunited with them.

Gregson tells Holmes that no one with the NYPD can talk to Adam. Holmes asks where he is.

Waiting for Adam, Holmes thanks Watson for being willing to put up with a ""difficult person with a difficult process for the greater good."" He says he may even listen to her again in the future.

Holmes talks to Adam again. Adam calls Abbott his ""dad."" Holmes knows Adam loved him, but he didn't love what he did. Adam is confused and doesn't know what to do.

He asks Holmes if he signs the deal, will it make up for the things he's did. Holmes says no, he can never get their blood off his hands. ""But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try,"" he says.

Adam agrees to sign the paper and tell them where they live.

They bust in on Abbott at the table making a sandwich for Mariana. He grabs her when they bust in, threatening to shoot her. Instead, he tells them to tell Adam he's sorry. Then he shoots himself in the head.

Later, Holmes stands over his dead body. He's more feeble than Holmes expected, and wearing a back brace after multiple surgeries. He would have needed Adam to help him get around.

There's a dingy twin mattress on the floor and a real bed in the bedroom. Holmes hears a whistling noise and finds a broken window in the bedroom. He snaps a picture of a hair on the bed.

Then he announces Samuel Abbott is not the Balloon Man.

Holmes waits for Adam in his bedroom, he snuck in through the window. He reminds Adam that he said he cut himself on the window in his bedroom. He knows the bedroom with the lamps, mattress and TV was Adam's room, Samuel slept on the dingy twin mattress. He confirmed it by matching the hairs on each.

""You occupied the master bedroom because you were the master,"" Holmes says. ""You tricked me, Adam, which doesn't happen very often. I thought you were a dullard. You're actually quite brilliant. It must take a huge intellect for a boy to turn the tables on the man who abducted him,"" Holmes says. ""You have no idea,"" Adam says smugly. Holmes asks whose idea it was to take more children. ""I'd just turned 14, I was lonely,"" Adam says. ""No, what you wanted was to make someone else the victim, hurt them like you'd been hurt,"" Holmes says.

Adam remembers seeing his parents on TV at least once a day after he was abducted. He enjoyed it. Turning the tables on Abbott was easy, given his low IQ. The trade for Marianna was Adam's contingency plan in case he got caught. He knew the police would offer him immunity.

""Are you here to kill me, Mr. Holmes? Because I have to admit I find the possibility very exciting,"" Adam says. He announces he's going to brush his teeth and doesn't expect to see Holmes when he returns. He's thinking of leaving town soon.

Back at his house, Holmes throws knives at Adam's immunity deal, which spares him from prosecution for any crimes committed ""in consort"" with Samuel Abbott. ""I handed a psychopath a get-out-of-jail free card,"" he says.

Watson suggests Holmes try more squats instead of throwing knives, but he did too many and his back hurts. He has a back pain epiphany.

Holmes goes to find Adam in a park, watching a family with a young child. He asks about his fifth victim, Billy. They just ran the DNA under Billy's fingernails and it wasn't Abbott's. Holmes mentions the date of the abduction, the same time Abbott was in traction in the hospital for his back surgery. The deal only covers murders committed with Abbott.

""It was only one murder, and Samuel abused me. I'll be out soon,"" Adam says as police cars pull up for him.

Back home, Watson closes the blinds saying it's time for Holmes to sleep. He thinks he'll see everything with a new light on his solving high. ""I'm going to solve three cases by nightfall,"" he boasts. Watson steeps tea. When she turns around, Holmes is asleep on the floor."

We open on Watson frantically telling Capt. Gregson that she hasn't heard from Holmes in three hours. As a cop, he is not alarmed by this of course. She finally spills and tells him that she's not his assistant/valet/lover, she's his sober companion and they're supposed to check in at least every three hours and she's afraid he's relapsed.

We cut to a tight shot of Sherlock, looking like he's nodding off in a drug haze. The camera pulls back and reveals, however, he is waking up in a daze after being abducted since his hands and feet are bound.

We flash back to two days earlier. Watson is out for coffee with a friend when her buddy unleashes an ambush blind date on her. The guy Watson's friend told to meet her is also surprised it's a blind date but they both gamely try to go along with it. While he goes to get his drink Watson puts her hair up in a ponytail and gets a text from Holmes. He needs her.

She heads back to the house and he deduces she met a dude she liked because she put her hair up, which he knows she thinks looks prettier.(He thinks she's wrong.) But no time for that.

The guy hasn't been missing long enough for the police to get involved but they want help.

Holmes throws on a dingy sweater, not kowtowing to the Wall St. lie of fine suits making the man in them any more fine inside, and they head out to meet the board.

The CEO is unimpressed with the look of Sherlock and is dubious about hiring him. After Holmes embarrrassing members of the board with naughty deductions about them, the CEO finally gives in.

First stop is the missing employee's office. Holmes notices lots of fancy books whose spines have never been cracked on his shelves. One has. He pulls the book out and inside finds a fancy brochure for fancy prostitutes. They track down the ""executive private accountant"" who helps the employee handle said prostitutes who gives up the secret apartment the guy used.

Watson and Holmes head to the apartment and discover the man, needle in his arm, dead of an apparent heroin overdose. Holmes, familiar with heroin addiction, isn't buying that this incredibly tidy, functional man died this way. He notices a half eaten salad nearby and deduces that a person who knew him dosed him with enough heroin in his salad dressing to incapacitate him and then dragged him to the chair, shot him up, and made it look like an overdose.

Watson pulls Holmes aside and checks in with him being around all of this drug stuff. He does not want to talk about it or go to a meeting.

Gregson and the other cops are skeptical about Holmes's theory but Holmes convinces them to send the salad to the lab anyway.

He also sits in on a meeting with the dead guy's wife in which he is, typically rude and insensitive, but discovers an important fact: the man who did this job before him also died under murky circumstances. After a little digging Holmes discovers that a handful of people from the company have died in the last couple of years and starts looking for suspects, starting with the powerful CEO.

Meanwhile Watson has gone on a dinner date with the set up guy and she really liked him but she's put off by the fact that she could tell he lied to her about never being married. Holmes says it's easy to figure out via the Internet. Watson doesn't want to cyber stalk but before she can get the sentence out Holmes has already clicked his way to learning that the guy is CURRENTLY married. Watson doesn't believe her friend would set her up with a married man.

Holmes also hears from the NYPD lab that there was heroin in the salad dressing.

Holmes calls a meeting with the board of directors and lays out the weird evidence of the dead employees. All of the board members scoff at the idea of someone in the company killing their way up the ladder. The CEO says the only person whose career path matches what Holmes is laying out is him. Holmes agrees he's a good suspect.

Later that day the CEO shows up at Sherlock's place saying he's going to ""end this."" Mad that Sherlock accused him in front of his employees. He says he's completely innocent and runs down his alibi for the first murder including surgery for a facelift. He says all of the employees are sociopaths and gives him a file of an intern who might have been responsible. Holmes can't work it out.

Watson gets another invite from the married guy who wants to explain himself. Holmes tells her to go. The guy says he did lie, and he married a woman from Kosovo to help her get a green card for political asylum and they can get a divorce in a year. He apologizes. Watson calls him compassionate. He wonders how she found out.

Holmes goes to see the dead guy's secretary, whose name popped up in the intern's file. She has followed the CEO during his meteoric rise in the company. He says every time her boss got promoted she got perks too, pay raises, stock options. She wonders if her boss knew about her killing people or if she worked alone. She blows him off with some of her own deductions and a taser.

We then cut to him in the scene waking up bound from the top of the episode. She has him in the back of his car. He claims he emailed a bunch of people about her and his whereabouts. She knows he didn't. She tells him that they will soon be arriving at the CEO's country home and in a week or two they will find his body buried on the property and Fowkes will go down for it. Holmes points out that when that former intern gets a promotion he'll need a seasoned secretary for help. She appreciates his smarts. He grabs a paper clip off some paper in the backseat and begins working on his handcuffs. She sees a text from Watson and texts back that everything is ""okay."" She tries to get Sherlock to dig his own grave but he refuses.

We cut to Watson spilling to Gregson. She says she believes the heroin from the crime scene affected him. But she looks at the text and knows, since it is written out completely instead of in his wacky text abbreviations that it's not from him.

The secretary puts the gun to his head. He's still working on the cuffs so to stall he invites her to monologue about her ingenius plans. Because she is a TV villain she takes this opportunity and is about to tell when cops show up. He wheels on her, unbound, grabs her gun and tazes her.

Watson explains about the text message giving the secretary away. He thanks her sort of, after a long way down the road of thanking himself. She tells him that she told Captain Gregson about their arrangement and apologizes saying he might want to have a talk with him.

Later Holmes goes to see Gregson. He tries to explain and apologize about how he was embarrassed about his history since Gregson holds him in such high esteem. He says he deserved to know. Gregson said he did know and he did his research before allowing him to consult with the NYPD. Holmes wonders why he didn't say anything. He said he did, sort of. He remnds him he asked him out for a drink recently and Holmes declined. Gregson says he figured Holmes would tell him when he was ready. He wasn't happy that Holmes didn't tell him but his work hasn't slipped one bit since Scotland Yard. He says not everyone is going to see it his way so he's going to keep a lid on Sherlock's secret.

Later Sherlock practices freeing himself from cuffs while Watson fields what she thinks is a blow off message from green card marriage guy. She says she isn't actually interested but is still annoyed that he doesn't seem interested, likely because he was freaked that she snooped online about him. Sherlock says seeing puzzles everywhere has it's own price to pay since deceits and illusions inform the things that people do.

Dejected, she goes for a run. Sherlock frees himself."

Holmes is choking a man. The twist of course is that he's already dead. As is his wont Holmes is hanging out in the morgue in a hospital doing research on dead people who donated their bodies to science. Watson is also hanging out but not so comfortable. Holmes surmises that it's not the dead people per se but being back in the hospital setting. She says she's fine but they better motor if they want to get to an exhibit at the Met that they're attending.

Holmes is good to go until he notices something on one of the bodies. A small mark on the thumb leads him to conclude that the man died of murder, not cardiac arrest. He posits that someone gave him epinephrine which mimicked a heart attack. Watson tries to protest but puts the clues together herself with her doctor brain and concurs. The man died that day so they head to his room to check out any evidence that might be there. A janitor is inside cleaning up. Holmes unceremoniously kicks him out and bars the door so he can look for clues. He finds an important one. Lipstick on one of the two coffee cups in the room, which means the dead man had a visitor.

Before they can follow up they're hauled into the hospital administrator's office with Gregson who wants Holmes to apologize. If he does the hospital will cooperate with the investigation. They meet the head of surgery Dr. Baldwin during this exchange-- a big, handsome dude-- who clearly doesn't like the puny little cranky admin guy. They also run into an old colleague of Watson's, a doctor named Carrie who wonders if Watson is applying for a position at the hospital. Watson explains she's out of medicine. Carrie says she thought her suspension was only a few months. Watson says it was but she's pursuing other stuff now.

Free of the hospital Holmes and Watson trace the cup back to the coffee shop where the pervy barista remembers the hot blonde-- and also hits on Watson. They track the blonde down at her job in a fancy cosmetics store and she explains the dead man was a neighbor who was terminally ill that she was kind to in the final months of his life, talking to him and reading to him since he'd lost his sight. She has an alibi but says she did once hear a doctor tallking to him late at night.

They leave and Holmes posits the theory that the hospital has an ""angel of mercy,"" someone killing terminally ill patients.

They go to Dr. Baldwin who says he will help pressure the administrator into giving Holmes the records he needs to continue to investigate this theory.

Holmes and Watson narrow it down to 9 victims out of 73 cardiac arrests. They have 23 suspects who had access to the patients.

Watson goes to talk to her friend Carrie for help while Holmes does the interviews.

At the hospital Holmes apologizes to the janitor in the elevator for kicking him out of the room. The janitor says no problem but then hits every button on the elevator before he gets out.

Sherlock goes to talk to Dr. Baldwin as his first suspect because 3 of the 9 patients were his. Holmes has also uncovered that Baldwin is on probation and one strike away from getting canned because even though he is brilliant and good he takes on risky maneuvers and patients. In addition to an alibi for the most recent murder Baldwin also points out that his favorite kind of patient is the unconscious kind and he's not really interested in whether they're suffering or not. In other word he's too indifferent to be the angel of death.

Watson's friend gets an emergency call while she's with her and asks her to come along for the ride. The patient is a 12 year old soccer player with a torn ACL. Watson notices funky markings on her toes and thinks it's endocarditis and asks Carrie to run some tests before surgery because if she's right, surgery could be dangerous.

Holmes and Detective Bell conduct interviews including one with a jumpy surgical resident. Bell tries the soft touch but Holmes undermines him and lets the guy go, deducing he's not their killer.

Holmes and Watson debrief and he admits he has no leads. Holmes also points out that Watson let him believe that she was no longer a doctor and she clearly had some issue with her friend. Watson says she let her license expire and she lost touch with hospital friends when she lost her patient. Carrie texts that the soccer patient is fine but Watson is still unsure. Holmes tells her not to accept this, and to go with her gut. He then notices the car of the jumpy surgical resident still in the parking lot after he'd complained in his interview that he'd been working round the clock and just wanted to go home.

In the hospital, the jumpy resident grabs a syringe and enters a patient's room. He's not their guy though. Turns out he's been stealing morphine. Even still, they catch him in the act which is good. But Holmes is mad that he didn't realize the guy was an addict.

As they go over more hospital records Watson notices that one victim wasn't terminal, a young female patient. Gregson calls and says the druggie doctor is talking and offering to help. At the precinct he explains that one night when he was stealing drugs from a patient a doctor came and he hid in the bathroom. He overheard the doctor talking to a terminal patient. Holmes goes to investigate again.

Watson goes to her friend Carrie again to ask for more tests for soccer girl. Carrie says she's overstepping and she and Watson fight about it.

They notice one of the victims was not a native English speaker and was in fact Ukrainian and likely needed to be spoken to in that language. No doctors at the hospital speak it but someone does: the janitor. It turns out he was a doctor in the Ukraine. After being confronted with the evidence, he confesses saying ""I freed them."" He maintains, however, that the woman that Holmes is saying wasn't terminal in fact was, that she had cancer. They walk out and Gregson congratulates him on his good work. Holmes is bothered though, he thinks the janitor is telling the truth about the woman.

At home Holmes looks over the janitor's very meticulous notes.

Watson's friend Carrie shows up. It turns out Watson was right, the girl had endocarditis. And how did they find this out? It turns out that SOMEONE ordered a test on the girl's chart. That someone was not Carrie. Watson feebly points out that one of their old professors said it was better to be lucky than good and that Carrie was lucky. Still, Carrie is mad. Watson says she knows what it's like not to be lucky. Carrie says that Watson was a good friend but a better doctor and leaves. Holmes compliments Watson on her catch.

The next day they bring Dr. Baldwin back to the station. They say they've discovered that someone else knew about the angel of mercy and that someone is him. They lay out the evidence: Baldwin left a clamp in the dead woman's chest. This would've been his third strike. So he conspired to make her a target for the angel by falsely claiming she had cancer on her chart and turning down her pain medication to make her feel the pain that the angel was attracted to stopping. After she died, he took the cancer results out of her charts. The only problem is the janitor, in order to take his meticulous notes, took pictures of the charts and they have Baldwin's signature on the doctored charts. Busted.

At home Holmes tells Watson that he liked seeing her in her former element and that Carrie was right, she was a good doctor. Watson concedes that she had her moments. He wonders if she thinks she might give it a go again. Unlikely. She heads up to her bedroom and looks at photos of her friends and colleagues in the hospital during her doctor days... and deletes them from her computer."

Watson awakes to Holmes' blaring police scanners. He laments that it's been a slow week.

Watson lets him know that his dad is coming into town and wants the two of them to meet him for dinner. He feels like this is very unlikely.

He hears a juicy ""incident"" on the scanner: a plane crash. They head off to the scene on the beach. Gregson is already there and tells Holmes they don't need him. Of course, he still asks the woman in charge what's going on. She thanks him for his offer of help and tells him she's all set. Gregson offers to give him cold cases to work on but Holmes instead goes to look at the crash victims and deduces they were all attorneys. He also deduces that one of the victims was already dead before the plane crashed. He also deduces he was killed by a wrench.

The NTSB official recounts an eyewitness account of the plane suddenly climbing, then shuddering, then crashing. Holmes spins his theories: 3 passengers, two men, one woman, all attorneys. One pilot. All dead. He wonders about air rage and notes the differences in granules of sand. Watson points out that since the killer died in the crash and thus isn't roving around why Holmes cares. She says he seems a bit off. He wants to ID the killer and learn the story. And, Watson points out, to forestall his father.

They go to speak to the last people who saw the victims alive. A friend of the pilot, who owns the company, knew the victims a little bit since they flew them a lot. He tells them there's a security camera in the parking lot the footage of which he can get them. The guy says the pilot is not their guy since he was a good guy.

Watson tells Holmes that his dad wants to meet for dinner at 6 and points out that he must have cared enough to put Holmes in rehab. Holmes says that his father doesn't care about him or Watson and he only did what he did out of familial obligation. He says his father is a serial absentee.

Detective Bell calls Watson and Holmes into Gregson's office. The three attorneys were headed to Martha's Vineyard to work on a class action case against a company called Carmanto Foods, whose sugar subsitute might cause cancer, there was a potential 100 million dollar payday for the victims. It turns out the murder victim Hank Girard was butting heads with his boss and fellow passenger Walter Devlin about how to proceed with the case. Devlin wanted to settle, Girard wanted to go to court and they had loud arguments.

The NTSB woman calls and says they've found the black box. Holmes translates the pilot talk but also hears the passengers fighting, including Ellie Wilson. There is a tussle and the woman yells, the pilot and plane go into distress and then the transmission ends. The NTSB woman thinks Holmes was right. He realizes he was wrong. After hearing only Devlin yelling in the ""fight"" he theorizes anew: Girard was killed elsewhere, earlier in the day and stuck in the cargo hold. Devlin though Girard missed the fight and called to yell at him which is why we didn't hear Girard's voice. The plane hit the kind of turbulence the NTSB woman thought it did originally and crashed. Girard's body was uncovered in the crash. The wrench was nowhere to be found even though almost everything else was recovered, thus the murder scene and the crash site are two different places. They find Girard's damaged phone and hear the voicemail that Devlin left. They realize they have a murderer to find after all since everyone who died in the crash was innocent.

Back at the precinct Holmes tries to work it out. Watson theorizes that Holmes is frightened of flying. He bristles at this. She asks how he got from London to New York, he doesn't answer. Bell comes in and says the charter company owner has video for them. It shows Girard alive, arguing with some fat dude. They ask the owner and another employee to clear out so they can analyze the scene.

Back at Holmes' place he determines that the man Girard argued with worked at Carmanto Foods, any employee of which would've had motive. Unfortunately, they have a lot of fat white guy employees. He does however, have an identifying, ancient pager. Watson says she's getting ready to meet the elder Mr. Holmes. Holmes scoffs and says he won't show that ""He's Lucy with the football, you're Charlie Brown."" She points out that it's not a pager, it's an insulin pump, there fat guy is a diabetic.

Bell and Holmes go to see the guy. He tries to claim he doesn't know the victim. They connect the dots for him. He shuts his office door and admits he was helping him as a whistleblower. He says Hank was angry because he refused to testify after Carmanto offered what he thought was a reasonable settlement. Holmes gets nervous when he watches him open his pill bottle. They leave. Holmes points out to Bell that he's no longer a suspect since his diabetes clearly makes it difficult for him to grip things-- like opening a pill bottle-- so there's no way he could've swung the wrench.

Watson meets Holmes' dad (who is played Roger Rees). He seems nice enough. He knows his son isn't coming. He admits to having laid as many bricks in the wall between them as his son has. He asks after him. Watson reports that he's mostly well with his sobriety but not so good on going to support groups. Daddy Holmes says he's always been stubborn since childhood. Watson says she's happy to be meeting with him and wants to know much more. Daddy Holmes says he wants to ask her one first: how's the sex? He says he figured part of the deal was sex giving how high her rates are. She realizes this is not Mr. Holmes. Sherlock hired an actor to mess with her since he knew his dad wouldn't show.

Back at the hangar, Holmes drags Bell along to talk to the NTSB woman about a new theory about the wacky sand he found. He realized that someone put sand in the gas tank, which would've stalled the plane. Someone wanted it to crash. Whoever sabotaged the flight also probably killed Girard. The person who sabotaged it was probably counting on it to crash in the water on the way to Martha's Vineyard and wash away the evidence of the sand. But it crashed prematurely on the beach and revealed them and that Girard was already dead.

Watson returns from her faux dinner. She isn't speaking to him. He says it was a good prank and she should appreciate the fact that he knew his dad wasn't coming. He informs her about the sabotage and says he's got a suspect and would like to go and confront him and wants her to come. She stalks off to bed. He tells her that she should've trusted him when he said his dad wouldn't show. She says she doesn't trust him because despite knowing him for weeks he's shared virtually nothing so they're still practically strangers and if he wants to pound on a criminal's door he should call the police.

So he does. Dragging Bell to the house of the other charter company employee who showed them the video and mentioned the camera that shot the other angle was broken. He's also a pilot. Holmes tells him that he knows that he and the dead pilot had a big fight. He says the pilot was mad at him for poaching one of his clients who was a big tipper. Holmes isn't buying this and thinks maybe the saboteur was mad at the charter airline itself and dug into some of the logs to follow up. He discovered that every time this guy flew back from Miami he recorded a weight of exactly 66 pounds over the weight of the passengers. Only Miami and why 66 pounds? It's exactly 30 kilos, which is good for cocaine smuggling. Holmes theorizes the dead pilot threatened him. Hank Girard caught him in the act of sabotage so he killed him and threw him in the cargo hold since he knew the plane was going to crash anyway. The guy thinks it's an impressive theory. The guy says he wasn't near the hangar this morning because he was with his boss whose car had stalled.

Watson awakes to Holmes in her room and says she was right that he is drawn to weird plane things because he sees so much,deduces so much when he gets onto a plane. He asks if she's still cross. He says he was attempting to demonstrate his trust. She wonders how since he was sharing something he already knew.

The owner of the charter company, who reeks of airplane glue much to Holmes' dismay, says the other guy called him and confessed about the drugs and how the dead pilot threatened to go to the police. The owner is all clammy and pale. He says he asked him to confirm his alibi that they were together but the owner says he wasn't with him. Gregson and the others step out, Bell goes after the guy but he's ankled. They find the wrench in his garage, which seems weird. Holmes determines the wrench was in the water recently. He thinks someone disposed of it and reclaimed it and planted it here after killing the guy. They find his money from his smuggling operation though and determine it must've been the charter company owner-- who could've benefitted from the smuggling operation as well and told them that the other guy confessed to do it all-- who actually did it all.

They go back to the precinct and the guy sticks to the story. Holmes thinks he's clammy and nervous because he's the murderer. Watson thinks the guy is actually dying of some medical condition he looks so unwell. Watson notices a scar on his wrist that lines up with a story that the actor told her about Sherlock's childhood. She tells him she has an errand to run and excuses herself. Gregson and Bell come out and say they can't get him to cop to it. Holmes looks at Bell filling up the guy's water glass. Gregson wants to cut him off, Holmes says to bring him a whole pitcher, noticing the smell of plane glue has transferred from the guy to Bell it's so strong.

Watson seeks out Alistair, the actor who played Faux Daddy Holmes. She says she knows he's not just some actor Sherlock hired, she knows he knows him or else Sherlock wouldn't have shared the story of his childhood scar with him. Alistair really is an actor but he also works at a bookstore where Watson tracks him down. He says Sherlock wrote him a fan letter from a radio show he was doing when Sherlock was 10. He says that they became a kind of friends. Meaning Sherlock would arrive with outlandish requests for help. She says it doesn't sound like much of a friendship. He tells her to revise her definition because if she expects Sherlock to relate to her like others he will migrate out of her life and she will be the poorer for it. Sherlock told him about Watson and Alistair says he's glad Watson has him. Alistair knew him when he was using but he thought he would grow out of it. He showed up at Alistair's house 9 months earlier high out of his mind. He flushed his drugs and looked after him for a day. Sherlock kept repeating a name but insisted the next day it meant nothing. Watson says she wants to help Holmes and needs Alistair's help to do it. She thanks him for his time and apologizes for bothering him. He tells her the name. (We don't hear it though.)

Sherlock goes in to see the charter company owner in the interrogation room. Holmes theorizes that he's drinking so much water due to blood loss. He figures that during the fight with the other guy he was injured and used model plane glue to seal the wound, an old military trick that would've kept him from going to the hospital and having the injury on record. The guy balks and Sherlock offers to let him go after he takes off his shirt and pants. The guy admits that he cut his side open on a sharp piece of metal and it's coincidental. Gregson moves in and tries to intimidate him. The guy continues to deny. Then they point out the wrench issue and how he framed the other guy. They realize he probably threw the guy's body in the same water he threw the wrench in. They tell him to tell everything he knows to get life in prison instead of the death penalty.

Watson comes home to a tidying Holmes. She says she has a question to ask him about his past. She says she knows about Irene and says she wants Holmes to tell her about Irene. He turns and stares at her, unhappy and surprised."

We see a masked intruder shoot two people whose faces are covered with pillows.

We cut to a tense Holmes-Watson househould. Holmes apparently has taken to be speaking only when spoken to. Watson says she knows she touched a nerve by asking about Irene but as his sober companion that's her job.He changes his tune and says he understands where she's coming from and says he respects that she must do what she must do. To toast this detente he says he wants to get a cup of coffee and then he runs out the door, having lied to simply get away.

Holmes goes to the crime scene, sees the double murder and immediately connects to a series of three murders that happened in 1999, right down to a missing high heel shoe taken as a souvenir. Gregson, then a detective, put away the guy Wade Crews, and thus advanced his career. So they figure they either have a copycat, someone working with Wade from prison, or that Wade was innocent in the first place. Holmes wants to talk to Wade but Gregson gets his back way up about this saying that is not a lead and that they should follow other evidence first. Holmes notes how agitated Gregson gets about this.

Watson shows up at the precinct. Holmes says that unless and until she stops pushing they will revert to how things were originally with him just being civil to her until such time as her father stopped paying her. Until then he will check in every two hours and she can drug test him but that's all, she will have lost all the good will she has accrued.

A task force is started to catch the guy before he kills again and it includes Gregson's old partner, D'Amico (played by Callie Thorne). Holmes also notes that there seems to be little love lost between them and it must've ended badly.

They run down a lead on a contractor who sent threatening emails to the dead couple. He turns out to have an alibi and it's twisted indeed. He's been keeping a sex slave in his basement-- discovered by Holmes-- and she admits he was with her the night of the murder.

Meanwhile, Watson goes to visit Holmes' rehab to find out more info about her charge and who Irene might be. Both of this therapists reveal they learned nothing from the very difficult patient. Watson notices a groundskeeper using beekeeping equipment on a hive and knows she's on to something. She goes to talk to him and indeed the man, Edison, knew Holmes and of his beekeeping interests. Holmes opened up a bit to him and when Watson asks about Irene he produces a pile of letters Holmes left behind: return address Irene Adler.

Holmes and Gregson finally go to speak to Crews who protests his innocence saying Gregson framed him with a mug that had his fingerprints on it. He also notes how his arrest helped further Gregson's career and then he quotes Tolstoy and talks about how he has learned to control his anger. Gregson not so much. They leave thinking they don't really have anything, but of course they do. And Holmes again brings up his possible innocence much to Gregson's chagrin and he tells Holmes to watch Gregson's police interrogations to see what a bad guy he is.

They go to visit the woman who was Wade's alibi. She recanted because she was having an affair with him and didn't want to ruin her marriage. When they arrive they are informed by her son that she died four years earlier of leukemia.

There is another murder and this time a third person is killed, which is different from the M.O. of the original killings.

At home Holmes watches the interview tape and sees something. He goes to Watson and asks for a truce so she can help work something out. They look and see that the mug that Wade drank out of during his interviews was the same one found at the crime scene.

Holmes goes to Gregson with this. In turn,Gregson, rattled goes to D'amico and asks if she planted the mug. She admits she did and says she figured he knew. He says even though his career would be over he has to tell the truth if Wade is innocent.

Watson brings the letters to Holmes who asks if she now knows all about him. She says of course she was tempted to read them but didn't. He promptly tosses them in Watson's smoothie blender. They put this aside and do more digging on the case. Holmes discovers a recently released ex-con who was a free man during the murders but imprisoned ever since. They think he may be a likely accomplice/copycat of Wade's. They break into his place-- which is sticky and dirty-- and find the murder weapon.

They bring the guy in but it turns out that he's blind in one eye and couldn't have possibly shot the third person and it seems all a little too convenient, as if he was framed.

While watching a news interview with Wade again protesting his innocence, Holmes notes that Wade quoted Oscar Wilde. When he went to prison he was an illiterate. So they deduce whoever taught him to read may have been his accomplice. They run down the folks from a prison library and discover that one of the people working there was the son of the woman with which Wade had an affair. It turns out that Wade is his daddy. They put two and two together and realized that the apple didn't fall too far from the tree. The son did the new killings to make it seem like his father had indeed been framed and would be set free. They go to see Wade and inform him that the jig is up. Wade is dragged away still protesting his innoncence.

Back at home, Watson says good night. Holmes cracks and gives up that Irene was a friend, they were quite close, and he did not take her passing well. He says good night."

We then switch to a hipster web design firm where young people bustle around complaining about the olds. We hear a beeping that one young guy tracks to a vent but figures someone just left their cellphone in there.The camera zooms into the vent. It's not a phone, it's a bomb and it goes off.

As the cops investigate they report the bomb killed two people and injured eleven others. Holmes and Watson survey the wreckage. He notes she probably won't miss this when she gets a new client. She says she won't but doesn't have a new client. Holmes picks up some pieces of newspaper and deduces it was packing material for the bomb. He then finds a motherboard from a pager which was likely the detonator.

While they wait for intel on the motherboard they go to meet the sponsor Adrian. Holmes essentially dismisses him out of hand and stalks off after giving him an impossible hypothesis to solve. Watson accuses him of there being no right answer to the question and that they will look for other sponsor candidates at a meeting tonight.

The motherboard gives them the number of the call that set off the bomb. It traces to a guy who essentially dialed the wrong number.

Looking at the bomb parts Sherlock notices it has a four year old battery and that the newspaper bits were also from 2008, so he deduces they found the man who set it off accidentally in 2012 and must find the person who meant to set it off intentionally in 2008.

Holmes and Watson go to investigate at a high-powered PR company that used to occupy the same office space in 2008. They meet with the well-heeled owners, including the company boss Helen, a crossword puzzle enthusiast like Sherlock who solves a few clues on the puzzle on her computer while talking to her. They put Holmes on to an eco-terrorist group that sent them threatening letters in 2008.

At an AA meeting Sherlock reads about the organization and ignores a woman sharing. He discovers it wasn't really an organization but one man. Watson presses him to look around for a sponsor. He says they're not his kind of addicts and the search will take longer. Then a reformed addict and carjacker named Alfredo begins to share and Sherlock says he wants him.

Back at home he fixates on a repeated phrase in the emails and knows that he's heard it recently. He realizes it was on television and he stands in front of his 7 TVs and jogs his memory. He recalls he heard it on a talk show. He finds the clip of the man using the phrase on the show and they track him down, Edgar Knowles.

They call him in to the precinct. Of course at first he denies being a bomber or eco-terrorist but then Sherlock gets his fingerprint from the elevator button and matches it to a bomb that went off in Utica. Knowles admits to the Utica bomb and the threatening letters but he promises he didn't set off this bomb, the one that, you know, killed people.

Sherlock sets off several mini-tennis-ball-bombs on his roof to do research. Knowles admitted using nitrate based bombs and Sherlock says this would be consistent with an eco-terrorist using organic materials but the bomb at the PR firm was petroleum, gas, and bleach-based so he knows Knowles is telling the truth.

Gregson is annoyed that Sherlock first served this guy up on a platter but now doesn't think he did it. But, Sherlock has also pieced together the newspaper page and discovered handwriting imprinted on it, the word ""novocaine."" He now believes a disgruntled employee-- with the cover of the eco-terrorist threat-- framed Knowles.

Watson waits with Alfredo but Sherlock cancels. She apologizes and chats with him a little and finds that she likes him; he talks about needing to be patient. He's never been a sponsor but says he had a great one and is looking forward to it.

Sherlock goes to the PR firm and begins his search in the personnel files. Helen, the boss, IDs him as a fellow addict... of crosswords. She starts hitting on him. He realizes that she wants to sleep with him and, while he's totally amenable since he finds her tantalizing, he's busy now and suggests they schedule an appointment and then she should not expect a relationship because that's not how he rolls. Watson arrives just then and Helen vamooses. Holmes has found a suspect, one Pradeep Singh, an upwardly mobile creative director. Although Singh was good he was also arrogant and after a fight with the male boss he just disappeared.

They go to his wife who says he's dead because he wouldn't have run away and disappeared because he loved her so much. She thinks he was murdered but the police cleared a man at the office. Sherlock asks about renovating the room they're sitting in. She says she hasn't. He asks to look in the back yard. But this is a feint, Watson and the wife go outside and he goes to look at a moldy wall. He takes the pictures off of it, runs his hands over it and listens. He meets them outside and tells Watson that he believes Pradeep was murdered and then buried in his own wall: hence the mold. He could tell because the pictures on the wall were in slightly different places then they were in a picture on a nearby table. She asks if he's sure. He says fairly sure. We cut to where Sherlock has ripped the wall open and revealed the decomposing body.

Back at the precinct they realize the bomb probably wasn't set by Pradeep because it was right near his office and he never missed a day of work. He was the target. In the dead man's pockets they find a safety deposit box key. Inside the box they find a Cheech and Chong video. They take the video to Sherlock's house because he has a VCR. While Det. Bell takes a call in the other room Watson presses Sherlock on bailing on Alfredo. She theorizes that he has separation anxiety about her leaving and once she said she liked Alfredo he turned him down to extend her stay. He scoffs at this. Bell returns and they watch the tape. It's a recording of a very young Pradeep meeting a prostitute. When she turns toward the camera we see it's his boss at the PR firm, Helen, also much younger.

They bring her in and show her the video. At first she tries to pretend it isn't her as Sherlock monologues about what happened-- he recognized her, threatened her. She planted the bomb but didn't realize there wasn't a signal tower close enough to the office to set it off. Since she came from modest means with a laborer dad she killed Pradeep, rehung the drywall while his wife was in Mumbai, moved office and voila, problem solved. She was ho-ing to help put herself through business school and then seed her company. She thinks he has no evidence. Then he plays the trump card: ""novocaine,"" which was imprinted on one of the newpaper pages. It was the answer to a clue to a crossword puzzle in the paper in 2008. They matched her handwriting sample. Boom, they arrest her.

Later, Alfredo shows up unbidden at Sherlock's home. He has parked out front an incredibly fancy car. As a reformed car jacker, dealers and manufactures hire him to try and break their car security systems. He says he knows Sherlock likes to pick locks. In an aside to Watson, Sherlock says he knows this was her idea. She says that whether he is dreading her leaving or counting the seconds to when he is free of her, she wants him to be taken care of. It was a smart move daring him to beat the new security system and he can't resist. He tells her it doesn't mean he's assenting to Alfredo's sponsorship. Sherlock starts to work it out and asks Alfredo for clues. He won't give any. Sherlock says that it's quite alright, he'll work it out and says, ""I'm entirely self-sufficient you know."""

A man stares into a masked man's face. The masked man is holding a gun. He shoots the first man.

Sherlock has a nasty cold this week and is thus also making Watson miserable. Luckily, Bell sends a text that they've got a dead body and invites Holmes to come check out the scene. They head down and the dead body is the man we saw getting shot. Turns out he was shot in both eyes. Gruesome.

Sherlock quickly deduces that this is not the crime scene and that the man is a professor of Asian studies.

They head off to the college the next day to check out his office with the help of his TA Brendan and determine that he had a thing for the number 13 and that means he was fond of gambling in Asian underground parlors.

They visit said underground parlors to find their perp. Their final destination is the crime scene-- which Holmes deduces by recently spackled walls and a janitor bleaching part of the floor. They determine the man is not the janitor but the owner-- thanks to his fancy shoes belying his janitor apron-- and discover the parlor had video surveillance. This surveillance leads them to one Raul who says he was hired to off the man by an unseen third party who contacted him only by a burner cellphone.

When they discover that Brendan had recently gotten a scathing refusal of recommendation for a job from the dead man they figure he did it. They also deduce that Brendan was having an affair with the dead man's wife- he made her awesome mix cds of sappy love songs like ""My Heart Will Go On""-- on whom their suspicion now falls figuring she framed Brendan by leaving the phone in his house.

When they go to her with this theory she admits to the affair with Brendan-- who has now confessed-- but that she did not kill her husband even though she had motive-- it turns out that he was an abusive sex maniac who brought her back from Asia promising to marry her but never did and instead made her his sex slave. She wants to prove this with videos he made of his evil conquests but his computer has been wiped clean.

Holmes not believing Brendan's confession but also believing the (not)wife didn't do it is perplexed-- and now worried since the wife is about to be deported-- until Watson clues him in to an anomaly in the dead man's eyes. It turns out that the professor had a painful, terminal eye condition and only had months to live. They deduce that he discovered his wife's affair with Brendan, wrote the damaging letter to make it appear that Brendan had motive to kill him, and then paid Raul-- who lived in Brendan's neighborhood-- to kill him, asking him to shoot him in the eyes as a symbolic gesture of relieving him of his pain, and then plant the phone at Brendan's house.

This, however, is hard to prove until Watson, again, notices something. Raul lived in Brendan's neighborhood yes but a few blocks away. Why didn't the dead man find someone even closer to do the deed to help cast suspicion, like say, the registered sex offender who lived in Brendan's building. They go to said sex offender and hit the jackpot. It turns out that the dead man did approach him but the sex offender was suspicious and installed surveillance equipment and lured him back to his apartment. Armed with video showing that the dead man showed up with hit money, they are able to solve the case; as the episode title says ""You do it to yourself."" Brendan and the (not)wife decide to marry that day to avoid her deportation.

In the B story, Watson is called by an ex named Liam to help him out of a jam. He is in Riker's, arrested for a hit-and-run. Unfortunately, he is a former addict who started using again and blacked out the night of the accident and believes he left the keys in the ignition and someone went for a joyride. He still swears he didn't do it. Watson is skeptical. Holmes, thinking Liam is a former client, prods her gently to look at Liam's arrest report. In it she sees how badly the car was smashed and notes he didn't have a scratch on him. She also notes that a silver keychain pendant that she gave him is missing and thinks perhaps, even though it wasn't worth anything, thieves might've thought it valuable. Holmes then deduces Watson was sleeping with him and wonders how long into their relationship she waited to do this. Watson finds the pendant in a pawn shop and goes to the police. It turns out that there has been a rash of joyriders in the area and Liam is cleared. He promises Watson he will now try rehab again and asks for her help. She is understandably wary but offers to get him into a clinic but says this is all she will do, they will not reconcile, and she will not be waiting when he is done. Later, she waits at the clinic for him to show and Holmes joins her. She admits that Liam was simply an ex, not an ex client. She guesses that he isn't going to show. Holmes says he will wait with her."

We see four masked thieves break into a high tech vault and steal lots and lots of shiny jewelry.

This leads directly to Sherlock getting a visit-- just as he's saying goodbye to two comely sisters-- from the head of the company that made the vault-- called the Leviathan. He is desperate to figure out how it was cracked. Not only is the diamond company that was robbed down $40 million but if word gets out that the safe company's most famous safe has been cracked, again, then their reputation will go down the toilet. He's heard Sherlock might be able to help.

While Sherlock heads down to check out the vault, Watson goes to meet her mom or brunch. Sherlock notes that she looks like she's heading off to a job interview not meet someone she loves. We soon learn that, although Joan probably loves her mother, that mom is maybe not super psyched that her daughter stopped being a doctor and started being a ""babysitter"" to drug addicts. We learn that Joan's brother Oren will be in town the next night for dinner and that they should all get together because he's finally going to introduce them to his girlfriend.

Sherlock is at the vault running through a million ideas, noting all the safety gizmos, cameras, and redundancies and it's driving him mad as he talks to the vault guy and meets the diamond company lackey, a man whose surname means ""green stick"" in French. Sherlock is so mad with deduction that Watson comes down to get him pointing out he's been there all day and that this kind of obsessive behavior is very much like a dry drunk. He stays a little longer, until she actually falls asleep. He's stuck on the idea that the computer programmed passcode was updated every two minutes randomly and the person who had the fob with the passcode was unreachable in Gstaad. He eventually gets so frustrated he just grabs an axe and smashes the glass displaying the code above the keypad.

They decide to try to speak to one of the original crew who cracked the Leviathan under the reasoning that the only way it could be cracked was by this crew selling their secret. The mastermind behind the plan died in prison but one member of the crew says he heard he did sell the secret to a man called Le Chevalier. Apparently, he was a wily master thief who stole priceless things that would be unsellable on the black market. Sherlock makes short work of finding the man. Unfortunately, he's not their guy since he recently had a stroke and can't walk. They do find his booty, however, and return it to Capt. Gregson. (All but one famous Van Gogh painting that Sherlock wants to keep for just a little while.)

Joan heads off to dinner with her family to discover Sherlock is already there. He charms the pants off everyone and explains how instrumental Joan has been in not only helping with his sobriety but solving crime and saving his life and Joan's mother sees that her new job is important. Later when Joan thanks Sherlock he waves it off saying Joan's family is conventional and he knew what to do to impress them on her behalf and that she is unconventional. It's the closest he's gotten to saying how much he appreciates her.

Sherlock realizes that one of the original thieves didn't settle so there was a court case. He reads the transcripts and sets his sights on the jury. Four members of the jury match up with the skills of the original four man robbery crew. One of them is related to the Green Stick man from the diamond company. When one of the new quartet turns up dead, Sherlock deduces the diamonds were at his house in a decorative glass container and that one of his crew mates killed him out of greed. Another turns up dead.

They call in the whole jury from the original case to get DNA. The two living members of the crew who do one seems reluctant at first to give them the swab but does eventually. But then there is no DNA match and they're perplexed. Until they find out he was a bone marrow recipient, which can change the recipients DNA make-up vis a vis a saliva sample but not a blood sample. When he balks at giving a blood sample, Sherlock lays it out and gets his man.

Later Joan's mom shows up to apologize and be nice to Joan and say she saw a spark in her eyes when she talked about working with Sherlock and hints that she should stay with him and help him.

A woman's dead body is found clunking around in an industrial washing machine in a large hotel. It turns out she was the manager, Teri Purcell, and was universally loved by her employees and a fine humanitarian.

Sherlock, Watson and Bell go to have a chat with her husband (Mark Moses), which turns up nothing more than the fact that there was obviously some marital discord since Sherlock notes that he was sleeping on the couch. Watson also deduces that the dead woman's daughter, Carly, although now a promising athlete and scholar once had a drug problem. She gives Carly her number and tells her to call if she needs her.

A nosy neighbor points them in the direction of a man who dropped by to visit Teri all the time, Jeffrey Silver (Jake Weber). He is a businessman who runs an international charity dedicated to the eradication of land mines. Nothing untoward was going on it turns out, she was just helping with his chartiy. He also has an alibi. So the husband and potential lover are out as suspects.

When they learn that Teri had run afoul of some call girls who frequented the hotel Watson and Holmes go ""whore-fishing"" in the lobby and get one escort to talk. It turns out, however, that instead of running them off Teri was helping them hook up with high rolling hotel guests and monkeying with security cameras to cover for them. (Thus there was no security footage of who killed her.)

They wonder why she would do this out of the goodness of her heart and go to investigate her office for secret compartments. They find one and in it evidence that leads to a secret cache of videos of hotel rooms. At first they think she was allowing the hookers to meet with patrons in order to blackmail them but then when Sherlock overhears two French men he realizes that Teri wasn't a madam or a blackmailer: she was a deep cover Russian spy who used the hooker to lure in international diplomats and then record their conversations, not their sex lives.

It turns out her husband was also a spy so they pick him up. He rolls over fairly quickly and says the international land mine guy was their handler. It turns out that he and Teri only conceived because they were told to and were not in love, but they did love their daughter. Unfortunately, Teri wanted Carly to follow into the spy life, which Carly confessed to Watson when she called for help. But since this whole ""you're actually a Russian spy"" thing was news to Carly they fought about it. Carly pushed her mom and believed she killed her. But it turns out that when Jeffrey showed up to clean up the mess, Teri was still alive, so he finished her off thinking it would be better to be rid of her and mold Carly-- a U.S. citizen-- into a model spy. Carly and her dad go into the witness protection program and Jeffrey is on the hook for the murder so he won't, as he thought, be getting traded back to mother Russia. . Throughout the episode Sherlock ribbed Watson about her staying on, first saying that she clearly enjoys his work and that they should engage in a weekly salon where she helps him in exchange for light housework. Then he talks about fooling his dad into continuing to pay her. But in the end, even though she does enjoy working with him, she informs him she has gotten another job."

Holmes and Watson talk about the fact the end of her work with him is at and end. She is working on a final assessment for his father.

Gregson brings Holmes and Watson to a crime scene. It is the home of a CPA named Vickers. There is no body, just an enormous pool of the man's blood. Holmes analyzes the scene with typical precision, then tells Watson he's followed this particular madman in London.

Holmes tells the police department the person they are looking for is called ""M."" He says M is the most ""sinister taker of lives"" he's chased. M has killed almost 40 people in the past decade. He has not been photographed and has no profile. He drains his victims and dumps their bodies in the ocean. M kills in bunches.

Watson asks Holmes why he seems to be so chipper. He tells her this is a second chance for him to bring a ruthless killer to justice. Holmes tells Gregson that M has referenced him in a letter or two, so a protection detail is provided. Holmes tells Watson he needs to get used to working by himself and will keep her updated via email.

Watson assures her therapist she has no interest in becoming an investigator.

We see M unemotionally part ways with a hooker. Afterwards he gets a text in some sort of code and begins working on a letter.

Holmes and Watson analyze Vickers' body, which has finally washed up. Based on the oil in his hair Watson guesses he was dumped near the navy yard. She tells Holmes she going to miss ""this. Working with you.""

Holmes and Watson return home to find a letter from M on the table. It is M's usual rambling nonsense, telling Holmes he is a ""mouse chasing a lion."" M got by the police by picking the lock on the back door. Watson isn't worried about M trying to hurt him. Holmes says she's going to stay there. Holmes is looking at one of his father's properties online, telling Watson he's thinking of moving. After Watson goes upstairs Holmes grabs a hidden camera and pulls up an image of M leaving the note.

We see M watching a woman going into her apartment building. A young kid tries to sell him some things by M pushes him away, eventually breaking the kid's phone.

While Watson works on her final assessment there is a knock on the door. It's an officer with the kid from the previous scene. The kid, Teddy, is a friend of Holmes and was instructed along with some of his friends to hang out near certain hotels looking for M. If he found him, Holmes was going to pay him several hundred bucks. Teddy shows her a copy of the picture of M from the surveillance camera.

Holmes arrives home later to find a very angry Watson. She's pissed about all the hidden cameras in the home. He explains to her how he figured out M would be at a certain chain of high-end expensive hotels. It has to do with his footwear and the shampoo he smelled on the letter, among other things. Holmes then teller her has no intention of going to police. M killed Irene Adler, the only woman Holmes ever loved. This led to Holmes slipping into drug addiction. Holmes plans to catch M, torture him and kill him. Holmes wants revenge and has been dreaming of this moment for quite some time.

Holmes meets Teddy and gets more information about M.

M grabs the woman he'd been watching earlier.

Watson goes to Gregson and tells him and tells him about Holmes' plan. She thinks it's possible Holmes may already have M.

We see Holmes sneak up on M and knock him out with a baton. Holmes takes M to a remote location and ties him up. Holmes makes it very clear what he's going to do. Holmes tells him about Irene and M initially doesn't seems to remember. M then recalls that there were a few copycat murders which took place while he was in prison for a fight. M, who served in the military, doesn't seem scared. Holmes doesn't believe his story and starts working on M.

Gregson and Watson interview M's recent near-victim. Holmes let her go as long as she didn't turn around. Based on the fact she saw powder on Holmes' shoes Watson thinks she knows which of Holmes' father's properties he may have taken M.

A bloodied M tells Holmes he's not a serial killer. He's an assassin who has been paid by an employer for all of his murders. He's never met his employer and occasionally receives coded messages. He says his name is Sebastian and tells Holmes to look up his case. He couldn't have killed Irene. Sebastian is furious that his employer played him for a fool.

Watson and Gregson close in on Holmes' location.

Sebastian wants to get even with his employer, someone called Moriarty. Sebastian assures Holmes he couldn't have killed his girlfriend. He tells Holmes that if he kills him he'll lose the best clue to find Moriarty. Holmes assures him that his is not an average man and sticks a knife in his stomach.

Police arrive and find the place empty. Holmes apparently walked into the station with a very much alive Sebastian

In questioning Sebastian tells police that he led Holmes to where they were and that his injuries were committed by Holmes in self-defense.

Watson tells Holmes Sebastian has confessed to all of the murders but wouldn't give him up. Holmes tells her Sebastian didn't kill Irene. He apologizes for lying to her. Holmes tells her ""I'm going to miss this"" and apologizes their last few days went so poorly. After he leaves she places a call to Holmes father, saying she'd like to stay on a little bit longer.

Later we see her get an email from Holmes' father. He doesn't wish to keep her on any longer. But Watson lies to Holmes, telling him his father agreed to have her continue the work.

The episode ends with Holmes staring at a wall. In the middle is a piece of paper with one word: ""MORIARTY."""

We are back and looking at Sherlock's corkboard dedicated to the mysterious ""Moriarty,"" the true murderer of Irene, which Watson calls his ""wall of crazy."" He has slept for two days straight. So he's hungry and excited to go play with some conspiracy theorists. He loves them like one would love a ""barmy uncle."" He claims to have ""started"" the ""CIA created crack cocaine.""

Watson goes to see her therapist who points out that Watson's contract with Holmes expired a week ago and if he finds out, it could destroy their trust and cause him to relapse. Also, even if she doesn't ""need"" the money she is not obligated to spend her savings on saving him, points out her therapist. She says she's just going to stay long enough to re-establish Sherlock's relationship with Captain Gregson, who suspended him after the Moran business.

Unfortunately, one of the conspiracy theorists turns up dead, hanged, with his pants down in his very stylish home.

Det. Bell arrives and calls it auto-erotic asphyxiation. Sherlock thinks he was hanged by a larger person and lays out his case: larger belt than the man, broken finger, which would interfere with um the ""auto"" part. Bell tries to oust Sherlock but Sherlock won't let him, bullying his way back into a consultancy by grabbing evidence so the police will come to him.

In the turtle habitat he finds a bug, someone was bugging the conspiracy nut. It was government issue. There was also spyware on his laptop. Sherlock says most of his ideas were insane but in one case he might have been on to something: ""The Red Team,"" relating to war games run by the government. The results are usually published but in 2009 they were classified. No one knows why. That year's game was designed to simulate a response to the activation of a sleeper cell in NYC. The goal of the Red Team (the ""bad guys"") was maximum destruction with minimum resources. The dead theorist believed the government found a flaw in our homeland security and that they killed a member of the Red Team. Sherlock figures if he can find other members of the Red Team he can test his theory that the theorist was on to something.

Watson goes to plead on Sherlock's behalf with Gregson, who is unsympathetic. Gregson calls him broken and that is unrelated to his old addiction.

Sherlock tracks down another Team member, a man now in long term care who can't remember anything but was once a brilliant man. His mind oddly deteriorated in a matter of weeks, with no family history of Alzheimer's. They talk to him. Sherlock thinks he's been poisoned to mimic Alzheimer's saying murder is just one way to stop someone from talking. They want to test him.

But when he calls Bell, he reports they arrested someone, another conspiracy theorist who turned himself in.

Sherlock goes to talk to the theorist, who is clearly nutty. Gregson is mad that Sherlock is there. He doesn't want to listen to his theory and blows him off and tells him if he talks his way again, he'll arrest him for trespassing. He, of course, wants to keep investigating.

They trace the bug back to the source by waiting for the source to show up and take his bugs back from the dead theorist's house. As they stakeout Watson tells him he should apologize to Gregson. He says Gregson would know he was faking. He points out, again, how he's smarter than everyone and it makes no sense to suspend him since his help is for the greater good.

They follow the bugger back to a highly secure building. Holmes gets them in by waving the bugs from the dead theorist's house in front of one of the cameras. The man who greets them claims they do market research. Sherlock explains, honestly, who they are to ""Bill."" He tries to be explicit about the Red Team and Bill feigns his ignorance. He also asks if someone wanted to take those people out from 2009 why wouldn't they kill them all at once? Sherlock was testing him by saying the names and he got clues about which ones were actually on the team.

Bell calls and tells him that the man in long-term care was in fact poisoned.

Sherlock brings in another member named Walter McClennan, who seems a little shaky. He brings him into a room with other members of the Red Team. He explains about the other members of the team who are dead and incapacitated and says he thinks they are in danger. They seem nervous. He asks if he knows might be after them. They argue that if any of them talk it will be treason. They all leave but the female member of the team throws a piece of paper in the trash. Sherlock retrieves it, she has written a code name ""Yossarian.""

Sherlock does some digging and thinks that maybe ""Bill"" is Yossarian, an Army Intelligence liaison during the war games.

His doorbell rings and some Feds are asking about ""Bill,"" who was shot and killed earlier that evening. They take him away for interrogation. He lays out his theory about Yossarian. They want to take him away for more questioning but he points out he has an alibi provided by the surveillance cameras in his house, the footage of which Watson brings to them. He wanted them to interrogate him so he could counter-interrogate them. He figures now it's not Army Intelligence killing the Red Team members. Holmes calls the police to take the other members into protective custody.

The police arrive at one place where the door is rigged with a booby trap gun. (Only filled with rock salt.) Gregson and Bell investigate the home and it's full of weapons.

Sherlock goes to see one of the members, an older man, resistant to leave his home where he is caring for his wife who has ALS. They report that Walter is now a suspect in the Red Team murders. The man was friendly with Walter and isn't surprised that Walter might be a suspect. He says the plan they came up with in dealing with what happened in '09 was disturbing and it changed them all. Walter was convinced someone was going to sell their secret. He joked he might do it. If he killed the Red Team members the price for their secret would go up.

Then, McLenahan turns up dead. Shot in the head in an alley.

Sherlock is worried that another Red Team member might be the murderer and... it's revealed that it's the older man they were just talking to. He takes out their NYPD minder at a motel and goes to shoot yet another member of the team and the cops stop him. He runs back into his room and holds a cop hostage. Sherlock wants to talk to him and promises he'll get Gregson's man out safely.

Sherlock talks his way in. He goes to the minibar first to get a drink before he starts talking to the man. He figures the man is not interested in profit he just wants to off the other members to keep their secret safe so NYC is safe. He wonders why he waited until two years after the war games to start killing people. It was two years ago his wife was diagnosed with ALS. He realized when he was approached by someone who claimed to be able to help his wife and he actually considered it, that each team member must have a price or Achilles heel. The man congratulates Sherlock on figuring out his plan. Now he plans to shoot Sherlock to gain leverage. Sherlock says he worked out the plan and he told a colleague and wrote it down. The man says if Sherlock's telling the truth, that's ""checkmate."" He asks him what the plan is and levels the gun at him.

The next thing we see is Sherlock and the man walking out of the room. Gregson asks how he did it. He says he told him he knew the Red Team's plan. He guessed saying that with a gun to his head it was motivating.

He says he and Gregson need to talk. Gregson says to meet him at a bar. Sherlock meets him and says he regrets that circumstances endangered their relationship. Gregson asks who the hell he is and that he doesn't let anyone in his life that isn't always concerned about him. He says most of the time he's worth it because he is special but if he wants to work cases he's right, Gregson can't say no, but he shouldn't ever forget that he knows Sherlock was going to murder someone on his watch and he will never really trust him again. Sherlock says he doesn't need to trust him to benefit from his intellect. Gregson agrees but says he does have to get something out of his system and then he slugs him in the stomach.

At home, Holmes tells Watson he's been reinstated. He's morose about it. He doesn't tell her what happened."

Sherlock is enjoying a floor show in his house by two scantily clad chicks who are enjoying each other and then him, as they handcuff him to a chair and kiss on him. And then they stop kissing him and start robbing him. It was a set up for the cops who bust the women. Sherlock asks to keep the handcuffs.

The next day he practices whacking a dummy with a ""single stick.""

Watson announces she needs to go to her apartment to check on her subletters. He is confused by this. She calls it her sanctum sanctorum, which she sublets when she has a job. She chats with her landlord about her whistling radiator when she comes home. He tells her he saw a porno film that was shot in her apartment. It turns out that her subletters were in fact making a porno movie in her apartment. Her landlord says he's evicting her because of it. Watson confronts her subletter and he says he needed the money to pay the rent since his serious ""documentary filmmaking"" wasn't drawing any interest.

We see a patient arrive at a hospital, Mr. Ennis. He is there to donate a kidney to his sister, whom he won't be allowed to see. He is anesthetized for the surgery and then the police remove his cuffs. But he was just faking and he grabs a scalpel and attacks everyone in the OR, kills the guards, doctors, and nurse and skedaddles before the surgery is performed.

Turns out he was a serial killer, who flayed his victims. Capt. Gregson, Sherlock, and Watson go to see the carnage in the OR. Sherlock figures out what he did with the anesthesia and the fake out. He wrote a message in blood on the door: Shedir. It's a name for the star Cassiopeia.

Since Ennis was a serial killer, the profiler who helped put him away, Katherine Drummond, returns to run point for the case. She wrote a book about Ennis in which she theorized that he was sexually abused by his parents. She was sued for libel but it was thrown out of court. Sherlock worked with her in London when a U.S. serial killer crossed the pond. He calls her a buffoon and a snake oil salesman like all profilers. Katherine comes over to say hello and gloat about Sherlock's ""troubles.""

His sick sister, who needed the kidney transplant, feels terrible that it was she that sprung him. She says they were not in touch otherwise. She says she's glad that Katherine is helping since she helped catch Ennis the first time.

Sherlock looks at a model of Cassieopeia and it seems like Ennis' victims are chosen based on a pattern in it. Watson thinks it's great he discerned this but Sherlock thinks it's a red herring on Ennis' part to watch the cops scramble. He also confesses to Watson that he slept with Katherine Drummond as an FWB, which Watson now thinks explains the frostiness between them.Turns out she agrees with him about the red herring.

Ennis grabs another young woman, as well as killing several people in a convenience store. He has her take his picture as he is holding up a newspaper with his face on the front page. He then leaves the woman alive and leaves the store. Sherlock can't figure out the message that Ennis is leaving by these actions.

Watson finds out why Sherlock really hates Katherine. She profiled him. She never used his name but in a pyschiatric journal she referred to him as ""the deductionist."" She betrayed him. Even worse she predicted his struggles with addiction and also predicted that he would come to a bad end.

Gregson expresses his frustration with Katherine about her not being of much help as a profiler. Watson says maybe the confusion is the point. Ennis then calls the station. Gregson chats with him and he addresses Katherine. Sherlock deduces that Ennis hates her because she ""solved"" him and ""demystified"" him and now he's going to violate her profile of him. Ennis is impressed by this and knows that he's ""the Deductionist."" (He says he read everything Katherine wrote.) He says he wants to ruin her because she ruined his family and he says his father was a good man who didn't abuse him. His father killed himself and his mother died shortly thereafter. He tells Gregson that it would be easy to stop, he just wants Katherine. Sherlock thinks this is reasonable.

Sherlock confronts Katherine about her claims of sexual abuse in the Ennis family. He wonders if she truly cut corners and just made it up. He chats with Watson about it, who reassures him that Katherine's profile of him didn't all come true. She then notices that he's watching the porn made in her house. He of course isn't trying to get off he's just obsessed with the continuity errors in it. Watson then notices one of her own.

Watson and Holmes meet with Gregson on a false tip that Ennis broke into his sister's house. Watson and Holmes discover that her house is ripe with things that are the exact opposite of what a person with kidney problems should be consuming. She was sabotaging herself. It turns out that she was in cahoots with her brother. She was also angry about the death of her parents in the wake of Katherine's book. He convinced her to poision herself so he could go free during the kidney transplant and take Katherine down. Katherine goes to her and apologizes for making the abuse allegations in her book and the sister attacks her with scissors. She survives and the sister is arrested.

But then Ennis calls Gregson again. He tries to cover his tracks by fidding with a radio dial while he talks to Gregson. But Holmes tracks him down thanks to discerning the overlap between two stations that Ennis dialed by while he called Gregson. Ennis recognizes him as ""The Deductionist."" Holmes has laid out a gun and a set of handcuffs. He says if he goes for the handcuffs he'll be the coward profiled by Katherine. But if he goes for the gun he'll go against the profile. He warns that if he goes for the gun, Sherlock will go for him. Ennis goes for the gun and Sherlock beats him down with his ""single stick,"" disarming him. The cops take him in.

After watching the porn and seeing a continuity error: in some scenes her radiator had electrical tape on it, in some it didn't. So Watson deduces that her landlord was there the whole time so he knew what was going on and he used as an opportunity to claim she violated her lease and so he can evict her from her rent-controlled apartment and charge market price for the rent. She points out that he participated in filming of an unlicensed production. So yes, she's moving out, but he'll be paying to put all her stuff in storage until she finds a place and $1200 for a new couch considering what happened on it."

Coincidentally, as that guy walks away, another guy in a hoodie emerges from hiding, drugs her and drags her body into the kitchen. He then apparently puts her in a suitcase and wheels her away. We see the first guy thanking a cab driver for letting him charge his phone with his charger in the cab.

Sherlock shares in a group about a crime, going on and on at length about a mongoose, and the group is clearly not amused. Watson points out that it was first share and it had nothing to do with addiction. He claims as a people person he wanted to cheer up the group.

A man walks out of their shower, naked. He's Rhys (John Hannah). He let himself in. He informs Sherlock that Emily has been kidnapped. Turns out Rhys is Sherlock's former drug dealer -- he's British or from his accent Scottish-- and Emily is his daughter who lives in New York. He has been sent a video ransom note and wants Sherlock to help. Watson would like him to put clothes on.

Watson worries Rhys is a trigger. Sherlock says he is but points out that Rhys is no longer a drug dealer and he needs his help.

Rhys shows Sherlock the video of his daughter bound and gagged. The kidnapper wants 2.2 million dollars and he has four days to get it to him or she dies, no police. Rhys had stolen that amount from Dominican drug dealers and went into hiding. He didn't know anyone knew about his daughter. And she didn't know about the thievery. He only has two thousand dollars left. He's a gambler. Sherlock says they have 44 hours left and that's twice what he needs so they should be good.

They go to his daughter's house. A picture shows the girl's mother, who died a few years back. Watson is impressed with Rhys' sense of calm. He says he believes in Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock deduces how the kidnapping went down. He finds a trace of a hand stamp from a Dominican nightclub.

They go there to find clues. Rhys looks for any familiar faces. He spots a guy in the VIP section who is one of the U.K. suppliers. Sherlock follows a guy into the bathroom. He compliments his tats and then asks about the kidnapping. He makes him as an undercover DEA agent and asks for his help and threatens to out him to the legitimate cartel members. The guy slugs him and claims the guy tried to steal his wallet. As he beats him up he explains that the cartel isn't behind the kidnapping. He apologizes for having to do it this way and drops him to the floor.

The next day Sherlock reads Emily's Twitter feed. He's given up on the cartel but still thinks the abductor was in the club. Watson says he has to go to another meeting.

She goes upstairs and finds Rhys having smoked pot in the bathroom and admonishes him sternly and makes him hand over his weed. He does so reluctantly. Watson flushes it down the toilet.

Sherlock finds a tweet regarding her stepdad Derek, who asked her for money. He's broke and working as a parking attendant thanks to the crash, intel courtesy of Det. Bell, whom Sherlock tells nothing. They stake out the guy at his valet job. Rhys commends Sherlock on his sobriety and how well he's doing his job without it. He wonders if maybe the drugs helped him.

They follow Derek after he gets off work. He goes to one of the buildings he owned, with groceries. Sherlock thinks maybe Derek kidnapped his own stepdaughter. They go in and look for her. It turns out Derek is just squatting; he didn't know about Emily's kidnapping. He says he raised her and would never hurt her and she only helped him out in a pinch. They leave him alone since Sherlock said he reeked of innocence.

The kidnapper calls Rhys and wants to know whom he's working with. Sherlock assures him he's not a cop. Regardless the kidnapper has left them a package, Emily's finger. He says he has also shortened the deadline by six hours. Sherlock examines it and confirms it was hers. And thinks it holds clues to her location. It has a distinctive burn from a radiator in a pre-war building. He also finds remnants of food under the fingernail and thinks he can deduce where it came from and cross-reference the building.

Watson brings Rhys some tea (and sympathy.) He is, understandably, freaked out at seeing his daughter's severed finger. She thinks Sherlock needs a little more time. You can tell he wishes Sherlock would shoot up and have an epiphany.

Sherlock rewatches the ransom video since the restaurant idea didn't work out, too many of them. Rhys advances his theory that cocaine helped with a case in the past, intimating that could work now. He went and got some cocaine. And gives it to him and asks him to do it ""for Emily."" Sherlock throws him to the ground and screams in his face. Rhys says he needs his ""meds"" and says he's begging him. Watson comes down and Sherlock flees.

Later, sitting on a park bench Sherlock calls his father.

Later still, he returns home and says Rhys will be reunited with Emily within the hour. He reached out to his father for a loan. His father wants him to perform 'errands' in return. He tells Rhys he got the money less to save Emily than to rid himself of Rhys and they are never to speak again after this.

Sherlock goes to meet the kidnapper.

Meanwhile the DEA agent who beat him down comes ot Sherlock's house and says he has information about hte girl.

Sherlock runs from a group of people dressed as painters. It was an ambush. He breaks into a house to escape and calls Watson and says there is only one person who knew he was investigating the case. Watson turns and we see the DEA agent has pulled a gun on her and Rhys. He ties them up. He tells Sherlock his friends are safe.

They chat while Sherlock hotwires a car. Sherlock figured out that the DEA agent heard about Rhys when he went undercover and how the Dominican cartel couldn't find him or the money he stole. With the help of old Uncle Sam, he tracked down Rhys and planned the kidnapping to get the money. Basically: dirty cop.

Rhys manages to get himself and Watson loose from their cuffs with a pocket knife. They try to run but the agent shoots him. As they struggle Watson knocks him out.

At the police station the agent claims he has no idea who Emily is and that he became aware of Rhys while undercover and claimed he followed him to Sherlock's house and he attacked him and had to restrain Watson who he assumed was working with Rhys. Gregson says he talked to Sherlock, and if Rhys pulls through he wonders whom they should believe; the agent says he doesn't care what a known drug dealer has to say. They tell him if he tells where the girl is the DA will make sure he gets protective custody. He says he can't help. They bust him on the take out food/pre-war building connection. They are searching the buildings and say he better give it up before they find her on their own. He finally gives it up.

Sherlock goes to the hospital and leaves an envelope for Rhys. He wakes up. Sherlock tells him that Emily is safe. The envelope is full of cash so Rhys can leave. Sherlock's own, not his dad's, which he returned. Rhys again says he believes in Sherlock and always will. Emily comes in and hugs him.

Sherlock sets about gluing together the bust Watson used to brain the DEA agent. He tells her she did a remarkable thing. He admits Rhys offered him cocaine and explains the drugs/epiphany theory. He didn't use it. He thinks he wants to share the story at a group meeting, they go. She is impressed and unsettled by this and they go to the meeting."

On his way home, Bell calls Gregson and then is suddenly shot at and run off the road. He believes it was a drug dealer he put away named Bradshaw who just got out of prison. Although he was very hands off when working the streets he promised Bell he would come after personally and it was Bradshaw's car that contained the shooter.

Simultaneously, Bell is looking after his brother Andre who was also just released from prison. They have a rocky relationship and have since they were young and Bell went the straight and narrow route and Andre chose the thug life. But now he's out and eager to help his brother find out who shot at him even if it means violating his parole and consorting with criminals.

But then Bradshaw turns up dead and Bell is worried his brother did it for him. But when the murder weapon turns up in his house-- uncovered by Sherlock and concealed from Gregson-- it's clear he's being framed. Then Bell is worried his brother did it to frame him out of resentment. His brother is offended him and clocks him right in the middle of the precinct.

But later when Andre himself is shot-- and manages to write ""was not Marcus"" in blood before he passes out--they know it wasn't he.

It is at this point that Sherlock realizes they have been barking up the wrong tree all along, looking for criminals when they should've been looking a little closer to home.

Bell, it turns out, informed on a superior who planted evidence to take Bradshaw down. No one likes an Internal Affairs snitch-- even when they're doing the right thing as Bell did-- and when one of the people who worked with that superior and also had an affair with Bell, found out that he was the one, she went on a one woman mission to take him down. Sherlock gets her to confess. Andre and Marcus make up in the hospital.

Meanwhile, this whole time Sherlock keeps testing Watson with out-of-nowhere attacks to prove that she needs to take self defense courses in light of her recent violent encounter.

While her therapist thinks it's time to move on from this ""grand adventure,"" it's clear that Watson doesn't want to.

Watson talks to him about boundaries. He then blurts out that he knows that she lied to him about renewing her contract with his father. He's not angry, but grateful she stayed to see him through his rough patch. But then he realized she wasn't staying for him but herself. So he asks her to consider a proposal: stay on permanently as his companion and he will continue to teach her and she will continue to assist him and she will receive a stipend that is equal what his father was paying and she can live at brownstone, relieved of the confidentiality agreement about his sobriety. He asks her, essentially, to be his partner. He admits that he is better with her: sharper, more focused, and it's difficult to say why exactly but perhaps in time he'll solve that as well.

Watson agrees, telling him she likes to be paid on Thursdays, she will stay at the Brownstone, and that they will still go to group support meetings."

Since Sherlock has been mentoring Watson about detective work he gives her a crack at it. She does the best she can but is wrong and Sherlock explains how. He tells her not to let failure discourage her since deduction is not just a skill it's a point of view.

They are approached by a limo driver named Crabtree. He works for Gerald Lydon, a muckety muck rich dude who owns 18 patents. They go for a ride with him and his assistant/nurse. He explains that he has dementia due to a rare genetic disorder, CAA, that will eventually kill him. He strongly believes he was given the disease by someone and therefore it's murder. He asks Sherlock to take his case. Sherlock expresses his condolences about his condition but since it's hereditary Sherlock refuses.

Later Crabtree delivers a bee in a box. It is a rare, nearly extinct variety and meant as a bribe from Lydon. While Sherlock is intrigued he declines convincing Crabtree Sherlock is a man of conviction. Not that this conviction helps much since Lydon then shoots Crabtree. When Gregson and Bell arrive, Lydon calls for Sherlock and again asks for help. This time Sherlock agrees...and takes the bee.

Sherlock and Watson go to a genetics lab to confirm his diagnosis and meet Natasha Kadmon, who wrote her dissertation on ""warrior gene"" i.e. the ""sociopath gene."" She knows Lydon thinks he was given the disease. She says that maybe there are seven people who might be able to crack the ability to give it to someone.

Sherlock and Watson set some ground rules on chores and he sends her to a dry cleaners and agrees to clean the fridge.

While they research geneticists crafty enough to give someone a hereditary disease, they get a text from a blocked number with a picture of a molecule and a note saying they are onto something. They realize it's Natasha and set up a meeting. When they arrive, she is dead. Stabbed to death.

Sherlock thinks it's related to Lydon but Natasha's fiance, also a geneticist, arrives and points a finger at a recently released convict named Benny Cordero, a man who claims she used his blood without permission in a study. He thought signing up would win him brownie points with the parole board but when she discovered he had the sociopath gene it wasn't really useful. Sherlock insists that Benny is innocent.

Watson finally goes to the dry cleaners and is served by an angry Polish woman working there who doesn't know what to charge and doesn't want to give her a receipt.

Sherlock and Watson go see Lydon's sons, people who stand to gain from their father's death and each give a DNA sample.

Cordero's blood is a match to Natasha's crime scene but he says it's not possible because he was busy taking blackmail pictures of his neighbor and his nanny.

Watson goes back to the dry cleaners and starts picking up weird clues that something is amiss, including very expensive security cameras. She realizes Sherlock wanted her to notice these things and solve the puzzle.

After they run a DNA test on Cordero and it matches, Watson and Holmes realize that someone, likely a very skilled geneticist, was able to fake a DNA sample. Turns out that her fiance killed her. After they were engaged she discovered that he himself had the sociopath gene and started pulling away from him so he killed her and faked the DNA sample. (Thereby sort of proving the point about the gene.)

He thought she was cheating on him with someone named Lincoln Dunwoody but it turns out that she wasn't. Lincoln and Dunwoody were two separate people, wealthy philanthropists who also mysteriously came down with the same rare disease Lydon had even though they had no family history of the disease either. It turns out Natasha was a whistle blower. She realized someone was poisoning wealthy people with the disease so they would give money to research for its cure. The culprit? Her boss at the genetics lab who, no surprise has the disease himself.

Watson goes back to the dry cleaner with Bell, having figured out that they were fronting a money laundering scheme, and has the angry woman and her enforcer arrested. Sherlock congratulates her on a detective job well done."

An onscreen title card informs us that it's six months ago.

We see a woman spontaneously receive roses on a subway platform from a man who claims his girlfriend canceled their date. Then he pushes her in front of a train.

That night we see Joan out with friends saying she loves her new job as a sober companion and then she gets a call for a new client and she wonders what kind of name is Sherlock.

We cut to today and Joan is busting into a fancy car. When she can't shut off the alarm we see she's in the car with Sherlock's sponsor the former car thief turned security man. He's teaching her tools of the trade to help out Sherlock.

She heads home and learns Sherlock's dad is asking for his investigative help in return for the money he loaned him recently to pay off his old friend's kidnapper.

They head off to an office, with bulletproof glass, to meet with a ""shyster"" attorney that his father wants him to help. It turns out it's the shyster's assistant Rebecca who wants help. Her sister Kelly is missing.

She shows them a video of Kelly breaking up with her husband via video and saying she's going to go away for a little while. She was inspired by the woman pushed in front of the train, saying life was too short to spend it with someone she didn't love. Kelly went missing a lot as she was a fragile soul so her sister wasn't concerned at first. But then after weeks in which Kelly didn't use her credit cards they got nervous, thinking her husband forced her into making the video in order to kill her since they had a troubled relationship. There's also a missing trunk, one that would fit a body, thinks Rebecca.

Sherlock disagrees that the video is fake and that Kelly wasn't under duress. Sherlock wants Joan to take this one solo and would be a good case since she clearly wanted to leave her husband. Sherlock decides he wants to go after the subway pusher instead. Sherlock leaves it to her to tell her father's friend that she's taking the case, not Sherlock.

Sherlock looks at video of the subway pusher and starts to investigate. As does Watson. Neither have much to begin with.

Joan gets a call from one of her old friends who she accidentally blew off for drinks. They make a new date.

Joan goes to speak to Kelly's husband. He says she was a complicated person. She had left him briefly before and that time she called him and she came back. Joan asks about their problems. He isn't sure, he was blindsided the first time. The second time she seemed distant and depressed over the subway murder. He swears again that Kelly took the trunk. He says he wants her to come back, not because they can be together since he knows they can't, but just to know that she's okay and to let her know that he wants her to be happy. Afterwards, Joan calls Sherlock and agrees that the husband might have killed her. Later she plays audio of an interview from the police in which he said the same thing verbatim. She thinks it feels rehearsed. She also just didn't like something about him. Sherlock asks if she wants him to tag in and she says not yet. She does ask what his next step would be. He asks for the man's phone number and thinks they should gaslight him. Sherlock texts from an anonymous burner phone that he knows he killed his wife and what he did with the body. He tells Joan to watch him now.

He goes to the police station to interview a suspect in his case. A man who worked in the same office as the woman pushed in front of the train. A janitor. Sherlock watched footage of that subway platform in earlier days and saw this man following the woman and taking surreptitious video of her. He has previous stalking priors. Capt. Gregson tags in and they pressure him. The guy admits her was there and was in disguise but swears he didn't kill her. He said he wore a hat and a scarf not the hoodie of the killer. It turns out he was recording that night and has proof he didn't push her.

Watson calls Sherlock from her stakeout and the husband hasn't reacted to the text at all. Alfredo comes to take over the stakeout because he remembered she made plans with her friend. She forgot again.

Sherlock notices a busker on the platform who stops midsong and takes off. He theorizes the busker knew the pusher.

Joan meets her friend and her other friends are there and they're a little surprised that she's working as a detective and were worried since she has fallen out of touch. They wanted to express a concern intervention-style. They say she seems lost. They're surprised that she quit her job, moved in with a recovering drug addict former client, and are worried about her. It's kind of insulting actually but she doesn't really explain it either and she takes off because Alfredo texts her that the husband is on the move.

They follow him and Joan sees him taking the infamous trunk out of storage. Joan goes to investigate his car and the trunk while the man goes back inside. She gets busted by the security guard. She blurts out that the man killed his wife and she could be in the trunk. The guard asks him to open it up saying if he has nothing to hide it doesn't matter. The cops arrive. He opens the trunk. It's empty.

Joan ends up in jail. Sherlock bails her out. He says the husband told the cops that he sold the trunk out of spite and he needed the money. So he bought it back to give it to Kelly's sister. He commends her instincts and although she was wrong about the trunk it doesn't mean she was wrong about the man being a murderer. Sherlock proposes they team up on both their cases.

Sherlock and Bell go to see the busker. He claims he knows nothing about the subway pusher. Sherlock leans on him. He says he just knew the guy's face, they had a previous altercation and he was afraid the guy would retaliate. Sherlock asks about a patch on the pusher's jacket. He IDs it and they want to show it to the public.

Gregson tells Joan that the husband will drop the charges if Joan will apologize and pay for the damages. Sherlock tells her not to apologize. She says she's not like him and admits the confrontation with her friends. She goes to apologize to the husband. And then she goes to see Rebecca, Kelly's sister to say she's going off the case. But then notices a picture of Kelly in a jacket with the pusher's patch on it. It turns out the jacket was her husband's.

Sherlock and Joan go over the the links between the cases including that Drew was the subway pusher. They wonder why? And why it affected his wife so much that she would leave him if she didn't know it was him? He prods Joan to stay with the case and not wallow in self-doubt.

They bring the husband back in, now on the subway pushing charge. He claims he gave the jacket to Goodwill. Watson worked it out: the video was 18 months old, it was from the first time his wife had left him. It turns out that another woman with flowers had been pushed in front of a train around that time. So he gave a woman flowers and pushed her in front of train and then killed his wife and used the old video to explain her disappearance. He calls her insane and says Joan wants him to be guilty.

They look through Kelly's emails and find the original one with the video archived. Watson is right.

Later she gets a call from her friend Emily who says she's not going to apologize for worrying about her, but she will apologize for doubting her since she's a reporter and was just assigned a story to write about the subway pusher guy.

Sherlock asks her to come downstairs and check out some files sent to him by a friend. He says he figured out who the murderer was in a matter of seconds and he wants to see how long it takes Joan. He says that although she enjoyed a modicum of success today she shouldn't let it go to her head.

She changes her job on her dating profile from ""sobriety counselor"" to ""consulting detective."""

The pair also get an interesting new roommate.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Andrew Bernstein'],"['', '', '']",[],['two word title'],[],"""Elementary"" - ""Snow Angels"" - April 4, 2013

A security guard reads a book as he listens to a report of a Nor'easter bearing down. A woman outside on the ground cries for help. He helps her and she pulls a gun on him and shoots him. Two male cohorts join her and drag the body behind the counter. But he was only playing dead and gets another shot off at the thieves.

Watson comes home from stocking up for the storm. She sees a woman at the Holmes house. Her names is Ms. Hudson and she's in tears. She asks for tea. According to Sherlock she's an auto-didact who has helped him with jobs in the past. He explains she has worked as a ""muse"" to several creative types. She is also a transvestite. She has recently been the kept ""woman"" of a Davis Renkin and his wife didn't care for that so for now she is their new roommate. Watson points out it would've been polite to ask her first.

They get a call from Capt. Gregson and head over to the scene of the robbery/homicide. The guard, Mr. Dempster, ended up dying. Sherlock and Watson work out what happened, which is what we saw. The thieves stole a number of hot new phones about to go on sale. Sherlock is unimpressed by the case. And then the lights go out --all over the city--and he's intrigued by having to solve the case without the benefit of electricity.

Gregson and a FEMA employee coordinate the emergency response. The electricity being out is hampering the phone/murder investigation but Sherlock finds a tweet that gives the thieves' location away. They track down a homeless man who says he ""found"" the phones at a bakery, in the dumpster. He says a couple of big white dudes dropped them. Sherlock gives him money to get himself a room. He leaves the phones since he deduces the robbery was a distraction from whatever the killers were really after.

They head back to the scene of the crime and realize they must've gone upstairs. They head up to the 12th floor and an architectural firm. An employee of the firm is standing his ground in the office in case of looting. It turns out that they stole blueprints, and the phone theft was a feint. They grab some corresponding schematics to help figure out what blueprints were stolen.

Back at the homestead Ms. Hudson is bemoaning her lost relationship and Davis comes banging on the door to find her. He promises this time he will leave his wife.

Upstairs Sherlock is working on the electrical schematics and can't figure out what the thieves are after since there aren't many interesting clients.

The next morning Sherlock wakes Watson and says it's time to get going even though there's a blizzard on. Sherlock realized the real prize the thieves were after, the blueprints for the New York Federal Reserve, they were waiting for a storm like this one to use as a cover. They have no way to contact the police and Sherlock says they have to stop the robbery, in East Rutherford, themselves.

They bump into a plow truck which is on standby and ask to come in to warm up. He asks the lady driver - Pam - to raise the police in the 11th precinct. He sends Gregson a message about the robbery but he doesn't know if Gregson will get the message so he decides they must get there themselves and they try to commandeer Pam's plow truck to make it happen. And then when that doesn't work he bribes her.

Bell goes to a hospital to check on a gunshot victim from the robbery. He finds a woman who claims she was stabbed. She's checking out against medical advice claiming she doesn't have insurance. She asks if Bell found the mugger who stabbed her. He says no, he's here on a different matter. He asks her what happened. She starts telling her story and he notices the blond hair from her wig on her coat. He busts her. He tries to convince her to confess and then Gregson enters and asks about East Rutherford.

Pam drives Joan and Sherlock and she asks them questions but Sherlock doesn't want to do small talk. Joan gets a bar on her phone and calls home to check on Ms. Hudson and Davis but Sherlock forgot to pay the bill so the phone is out, not because of the storm. They arrive at the Federal Reserve building and an imperious man says there's no way they're getting in since they can't raise the police to confirm who they are and there's no chance to get into their vaults directly anyway. But then the imperious guy notices a strange sort of information on the computer screen. They discover that the thieves got in, looped the security footage, and shredded fake paper to cover their theft of $30 million.

Sherlock finds the point of entry/exit, a faraway door that leads to a tunnel. Sherlock notices a trail in the snow into the woods and says they haven't been gone for more than an hour. They think it's not too late to catch them.

Bell and Gregson continue to investigate the woman who has worked many larcenies with her Russian husband. They ask her to give him up or else she'll face a murder charge alone. Sherlock finally gets in touch with them via Pam's radio. Sherlock deduces that even though they were planning to go to non-extradition countries they had to clean the money, they think they decided to do it through a race track.

Watson, Holmes, and Bell stake out the house of the race track employee. The ambulance they're carrying the money in arrives. They descend on the house and ambulance and... they're wrong. Sherlock realizes they've been duped yet again, like with the phones.

Pam drops them off and says it was fun and to call them if they need a plow for hire ever again. At home the house has been cleaned to spotlessness by Ms. Hudson. She has even arranged Sherlock's books to his liking. She reports that she and Davis did break up and she has to take another look at that ""kept woman"" thing.

Sherlock tries to work out how the thieves got by them in their ambulance while the city was locked down. Sherlock figures it out and takes his theory to Gregson, how they created a hole in the checkpoints which means they have a high level player on the inside, like perhaps the new FEMA official.

Bell goes back to the female thief and says they are putting her away for life for murder. The lights start flickering and they stage what looks like jailbreak because of the power flicker. They make the woman believe that she might be able to escape with the help of her high level accomplice, and wait to see who that person is. It turns out they were right, it is the FEMA woman.

Ms. Hudson takes off but has agreed to clean their house weekly and Sherlock forces Watson to split the cost with him 50/50. Pam arrives to give her a ride to her new place."

Holmes agrees to find the blackmailer and his accomplice and destroy all evidence of the tape because, as he says ""I have a particular disdain for blackmailers."" Holmes discovers that the blackmailer is one Charles Augustus Milverton. Holmes breaks into Milverton's house but is forced to hide when Milverton returns. A masked shooter enters and kills Milverton, but Holmes cannot see the murderer from his concealment.

During the case, Holmes repeatedly complains about an upcoming meeting where he is scheduled to accept his one year sobriety chip. Alfredo tells Holmes, ""I know it's hard, but one of these days you have to get over yourself."" Holmes learns that the chip ceremony is not just for his own benefit. It inspires other members by seeing someone succeed. Finally, Holmes confesses that he will not be exactly one year sober. He cheated by doing drugs one more time as a ""last hurrah"" before entering rehab.

Holmes accepts the chip at the ceremony. At the end, Watson gives Holmes a framed excerpt from the Robert Frost poem 'Stopping By Woods On a Snowy Evening' with its concluding lines - ""miles to go before I sleep.""

Holmes soon learns the one behind the murder is an old nemesis known to him only as ""Moriarty"".",[],TV-14,Release date,['Peter Werner'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"We open on a man returning home to find another man perched on his couch with a laptop. (We will learn later this man's name is Daniel Gottlieb.) With the laptop Gottlieb has the power to hack the pacemaker in the man's chest. He wants the man to ""revoke"" his vote on a committee he sits on. The man grabs his iPad, revokes his vote and... Gottlieb kills him anyway.

Sebastian Moran summons Sherlock to talk to him in prison and he gives him the dead man's obituary. He says Moriarty did it and Sherlock should follow up. He knows this because he was contracted to kill this man himself before Sherlock landed him in the clink. Moran then kills one of his prison guards, apparently for sport.

Sherlock lies to Gregson and says Moran told him nothing so he can investigate the claims on his own first. He and Watson go and perform an autopsy on the dead man and discover that his blood was literally boiled and he had marks on his hand consistent with being shocked and deduce that someone hacked his pacemaker.

After some other digging the discover the ""revoke"" vote he made right before he died. It appears his vote was the deciding one to knock an old prohibition era speakeasy off a historic register list meaning that a real estate/contractor could renovate the site now. All of the others who voted to revoke had contracting work done by the same man so they figure he must be behind it.

Until that man too is killed by an air conditioner falling out of a window. We see that that AC was pushed onto him by Daniel Gottlieb in an act of perfect timing.

After a bit of more digging they realize that a woman who was a vocal opponent to preserving the speakeasy status as a historic site will be the next target. They begin following her, basically using her as bait. They see she's wearing a medic alert bracelet that shows she's allergic to bees. They also discover that in the park that she runs through every single day now has a hive of rare Africanized honey bees, that if they stung her, would kill her almost instantly. Like the ""natural"" heart attack and the air conditioner ""accident"" it would look like the woman died of ""natural"" causes. Watson calls it a ""baroque"" plan but Sherlock admires it as quite tidy. They figure the man funding the bees will have to come back soon so they stakeout the beehive.

Watson wants to know what the plan is if they catch this man who works for Moriarty. Sherlock promises that he just wants to know who killed Irene and when they catch the guy he won't kill him. Watson doesn't believe him since nothing has changed since he almost killed Moran. Sherlock says he only made a real connection with one person, Irene. And now, in a roundabout way that makes it seem like he's talking solely about their teacher/student relationship, he says he's made another connection with her, which has changed him, or at least makes him want to see how his ""project"" turns out. She says it's one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to her. He says he'd like to promise her that he won't hurt the person responsible for Irene's death, just as he would that he'll never do drugs again but he's an addict and can't make promises but he asks her to trust his intent.

The ""beekeeper"" arrives it is Gottlieb. Sherlock claims they need to look at his notebook and then he tazes him.

They bring him back to the brownstone, tie him up in Sherlock's straitjacket and question him about the murders and Moriarty. Gottlieb has an encrypted message on his phone from Moriarty. They give him two options. Sherlock is going to send a message back saying things have gone wrong and they need to meet face to face and if by the time they get a response Gottlieb has told them everything he knows about Moriarty Sherlock will impose upon the police to give him special treatment. Or they'll just hand him over to the cops.

Gottlieb says he has killed 31 people, unclear if they were all for Moriarty, but doesn't know who he is. He does tell them what he knows: 8 years ago he was doing an environmental impact study in the U.K. and a tall British guy sat down next to him and asked him to dinner since he wanted to pick the brain of a serial killer who was passing in society. He had figured Gottlieb out and said he'd be in touch. He says it was all on the phone after that. He says he mentioned he spent time in reform school as a kid. He also says he knows Sherlock, and had an ""accidental overdose"" lined up for him but then another text canceled the job. He says it was the only time he got a cancellation.

After receiving a return message for a meet-up, Sherlock and Watson stake out the diner where it's supposed to go down. They don't expect Moriarty himself to show. Gottlieb, of course, doesn't show and they follow the man who looks like he was waiting for someone and takes off in a fancy car. He crosses some train tracks just as a train is coming effectively cutting off Sherlock and Watson. He meets someone on the other side. By using a superfast setting on his camera and opening the aperture wide Sherlock takes a series of fast photos, between the train trucks, slices up the images and pastes them together coming up with a man's face. Gottlieb confirms that is the man who recruited him.

Sherlock studies the photo. He worked his contacts in the U.K. and narrowed down those who did time in reform schools and prisons and found him. John Douglas. Turns out he was also brilliant and lethal as a boy. While in reform school his best friend was beaten to death by older boys and a few months later a few of his assailants were dead. He was released on his 18th birthday and he has no rap sheet. Sherlock thinks he's been using the Moriarty alias for 45 years. Watson wonders what they'll do next. Sherlock says he doesn't know.

The next morning Watson awakes to an apology from Sherlock. He says he knew more than he let on and he's sorry for abandoning her at the climax of their drama and he's of to see what he'd do with a loaded syringe.

He confronts Douglas in his hotel-- registered under his childhood friend's name-- and he's impressed he found him. He asks if he's Moriarty. He says he's not him, he could never be him, but he does know why he's looking for him: Irene. He says he didn't kill her but knows why she had to die: it was because of Holmes. And then Douglas gets shot in the back, right through the window.

The police arrive and Gregson wants to know what the hell is going on with Sherlock. He half-admits the stuff about Moran and this guy working for someone else and Sherlock is looking for him. He gives his word he won't repeat his Moran tactics. Gregson says he wishes his word meant more to him. Watson arrives and looks in her medical bag that Sherlock brought to intimidate Douglas. It's full of Lego. Sherlock offers this as proof that he's a changed man.

Watching the interrogation on the opposite side of the glass, Gottlieb is confessing, 18 murders so far says Gregson to Watson and Holmes. He has no interest in an attorney, he just wants to talk. He gets a text and they have him read it. Gottlieb can't translate it. Holmes brings it to Moran. He can't read it either, agreeing with Gottlieb that it's not a code they used. Moran does seem to know though and all he says is, ""leave it"" in a very menacing fashion.

Holmes works on decrypting the code. Watson offhandedly notes the time and Holmes realizes that is the decryption key: when the message was sent.

As he works it out we cut to Moran in his cell singing on old football drinking song. Sherlock cracks the code: it's a note to Moran. ""You never told me you had a sister, either you die or she does- M."" We cut to Moran bashing his head against the wall.

Sherlock tries to call Gregson to have him warn the warden but it's too late. Moran bashed himself into a coma and has terrible brain swelling. They realize Moriarty played him into bringing the text to Moran.

Sherlock says Moriarty had him in his sights twice and left him alive so he doesn't know what the game is. Watson points out that he may be the game. Gottlieb's phone rings. It's Moriarty, he says they're overdue for a chat."

Holmes gets a call from Moriarty. He taunts him about how he is like a spider with a large web of people working for him. He tells Holmes if he can solve the cold case murder of a man named Wallace Rourke he will tell him all about Irene Adler.

Holmes gets to work, Rourke appears to have been robbed and killed. Watson wants to talk about the fact that he's doing it all. Holmes says that doing this will get him closer to Moriarty, who if he wanted Holmes dead could've made that happen already.

They go to the precinct to do research. There Gregson asks Watson, as a favor to him, to be a sober companion to the daughter of a friend after she gets out of rehab. Watson demurs saying she no longer does it but says she'll give him names.

They go to see Rourke's widow who knows nothing of Moriarty. But she says Wallace did think he was being followed but since he was just a mechanic she doesn't think he could've been involved in anything really nefarious. They collect his things and discover an old cell phone.

Holmes and Watson deduce that Rourke's murder was very specifically carried out - stunned, immobilized, and then stabbed in each lung.

Watson asks Holmes about what Irene was like. He says she was American, difficult to explain, a great painter who worked as a restoration artist, highly intelligent, well-traveled and optimistic about the human condition. She was to him ""the"" woman.

They discover something hinky about his new cell phone, which was stolen when he died. They think he was being followed via GPS on it. They visit a private security firm run by Darren Sutter and his wife Peg. They notice in passing that Sutter is a martial artist. Sutter claims he doesn't know Rourke but his company was tracking his phone. They ask who hired them to send the phone and track him. They admit they only watched him for a few days. They say their client said he made threats but they found the claims were unfounded. They won't tell. Holmes thinks Sutter made it up.

Sutter's sister was murdered as a young woman 22 years ago-- he wrote about it in his book-- and Holmes believes that Rourke committed the murder, Sutter found him and killed him, employing his martial arts skills. Holmes thinks Moriarty wants them to bring Sutter down, which will make his private security clients more vulnerable.

Holmes meets privately with Sutter in a park and lays out his theory and asks him about Moriarty, who he says he thinks would profit from Sutter's incarceration. Sutter isn't quick to trust him and that he won't go to the police. Holmes tells him to check for bugs in his office.

Gregson asks Watson about helping his friend again. She worries he's unhappy with her work. He says she's doing a great job but worries that she's letting her life be subsumed by Holmes and her safety around him. While she's in the precinct, Sutter comes in to confess to Rourke's murder. Holmes watches the interrogation and thinks Sutter found the bugs and that Moriarty was listening. Holmes wishes Sutter had come to him and now all they can do is wait for Moriarty's call since they found Rourke's murderer as he asked themhim to.

As they wait for the call at the apartment he asks about why she was seeing Gregson but then the phone rings and it's Moriarty. Holmes wants his answers. Moriarty says he only did half the job. It turns out that Sutter killed the wrong man --Rourke didn't kill Sutter's sister and had an alibi-- and Holmes has to finish the job.

Holmes stays up all night and discovers that Moriarty was at least possibly correct about Rourke not being the man who killed Leah and then indeed Sutter killed the wrong man so they have to find Leah Sutter's killer.

Watson wonders aloud why Moriarty is making Holmes jump through these hoops. He says he's not afraid she points out that there are ways of hurting him that don't involve hurting him physically. Holmes promises no harm will come to her.

They split up to investigate. Holmes goes to see Sutter in prison and lays out the evidence that Sutter was misled in killing the wrong man. Sutter thinks Holmes is being played.

Watson goes to see Sutter's wife and plays tape of Moriarty but she doesn't recognize the voice and won't let Watson look at her client list. She also refuses to believe that her husband was tricked into killing the wrong man. She met him at a candlelight vigil for his sister all those years ago. She's grateful that he's found some peace even if it means jail time.

They try to piece together information about Sutter's clients through people he's helped put away. Holmes freaks out in frustration at being so close to answers and says he refuses to come up empty-handed and he knocks over his corkboard with all the info pinned to it. Watson cleans up and notices a photo of Sutter and his wife.

Watson theorizes his wife tricked into killing Rourke to make himself feel better: to give him peace.

They go to see her with Gregson and Bell. They say her prints match those found at Leah Sutter's house the night she died. She admits she and Darren were having an affair. That night she saw the killer's face, not her husband so it was her that told him that Wallace Rourke was the killer. To cover their affair Darren claimed he saw the man. She insists that he was the man. They relay to her that Rourke was out of the country and she was wrong. She confesses after she found him in a suicide attempt on the 20th anniversary of his sister's death that she pinned it on Rourke and she doesn't regret it. So now Holmes and Watson have found the person who really killed Rourke.

Holmes goes to tell Sutter in jail. He promises to try and find Leah's killer. Sutter says there won't be justice until he can strangle the man who did it.

Moriarty calls Holmes again and texts him an address. He lies to Watson that he hasn't heard from him and goes to the address, a palatial mansion behind gates. Watson tracks Holmes to the house, busting him in a lie. He says he lied to protect her. She says she doesn't want it. She says she deserves answers as well since she's worked with him every step of the way. They enter the house. It is mostly empty. They wander around. Out on a patio they hear music and see dozens of paintings of cityscapes on easels. And a painter. Holmes collapses in tears and points at a blond woman, the painter, on a stool and calls ""Irene."" The woman turns around."

Irene Adler is alive!

He grabs her, she resists and then they embrace.

We flash back to London, two years ago.

He met her while working on an art forgery case. She confirms they're fakes. Upon meeting him she calls him beautiful, noting the symmetry of his face. She is doing restoration in her apartment when they meet and he admires her work on the paintings. He notes that she has an original painting on her wall, which means she returned to the museum a forgery she had made, as she had with the other paintings on her wall. He strikes a bargain: if he can spot which ones are real and which ones are fake she will go on a date with him. She accepts but wonders why they would need to leave the apartment to enjoy each other's company.

We then sprint to the present, Irene is in the hospital, disoriented, apparently unaware that it's 2013. Holmes waits outside and Watson offers to talk if need be. Gregson arrives with no info from investigating the house. The doctor tells them that she's fine physically and is suffering PTSD. She was abducted and moved from place to place and then subjected to deep psychological torture, destroying her personality and making her dependent. The abductor calls himself Stapleton and wears a clown mask. Sherlock blames himself for this happening. Moriarty wanted him to think her dead, mourn her, get addicted to drugs, come back to life and then send her back to him a completely different person. He wonders aloud where all the blood from the scene came from and how he couldn't know she was still alive. Watson tells Holmes that they can help Irene. Holmes doesn't want to consult on the case. He wants to look after her and says he wouldn't be of much use since Moriarty is so much smarter than him.

They bring Irene home three days later. She has no family to speak of so Holmes doesn't expect to hear from anyone. Watson wants to help Holmes but doesn't want to be in the way and offers to leave. He says this is her home and they can work it out as they go but mostly he wants her to work on Irene's case. She's nervous to do it alone but Holmes has confidence in her.

Watson goes with Gregson to the scene. She finds a clue in some rare paint and Bell and Gregson say it's just like having Holmes there.

We flashback to London and Holmes asking Irene why she's been rebuffing him since their first, marathon-of-sex date. She says it was too unique and memorable to try and repeat. She says people don't treasure things anymore and he should try it. He offers to give her another totally unique experience. He takes her to tunnels underneath Camden Market. They skedaddle into an undocumented portion of the tunnels and check out an ancient canal. He says they are the only two people who know about it.

Back in the present, Irene is freaking out in her bed that Stapleton ""changed the rules"" without telling her. She asks him to sit with her and catch her up and tell the story of the last year and a half and his move to New York. Watson returns just then and Gregson calls with a tip on the rare paint, only one person bought some recently: a known felon named Duane Proctor. They go to see him, but his brother Isaac tells them he isn't there. When Duane returns home, he tells the police that he bought the paint for his brother. Gunshots ring out from inside. Isaac has shot one of the detectives and escaped.

Later, as he cuts his hair and shaves his beard to change his appearance, Isaac gets a call from a Moriarty minion saying he needs to do them a favor involving Sherlock Holmes.

We flashback to London and Holmes and Irene post-coital, with Holmes working the case that was related to Sebastian Moran with the tripod and the blood-draining. Romantic. He then compliments her on enigmatic nature. They then talk about her current restoration work and he asks after her original work. He wants to see it. She says he'll see it when it's ready.

Back in the present she watches TV. She says it must be difficult having her there and can only imagine what he's picking up from her right now, clues, pain. He catches her up on his life. He comes clean about becoming an addict in the wake of her death because he was broken. His dismissal by Scotland Yard. His dad forcing him into rehab. He apologizes that what happened to her was his fault. She says he fixed himself and that gives her hope. She then goes to her room and shrieks. She sees a white flower on her bed and says this means Stapleton was there.

Back in the past in London, Irene leaves a message to tell Sherlock it's time to see her original work. He enters her apartment to see a pool of blood and a note from Moriarty.

In the present he takes Irene to a safe house he has. He explains the flower was a message from Moriarty to him, that as long as Irene is in his life he will be in danger. So he says he has to let her go, send her far away and when he is ""finished"" with Moriarty he will find her. He doesn't know how else to protect her. She says she has an idea.

Gregson, Bell, and Watson find the footage of Isaac infiltrating Holmes's house. Watson meets with Holmes in secret at the precinct and catches him up. He catches her up: he's leaving with Irene, this was her idea. Holmes hopes that Watson can figure it out in his absence but he feels he owes Irene this. Watson thinks this is what Moriarty wants and therefore is wrong.

Isaac meets up with another of Moriarty's minions. One tries to double cross the other and that the ""hands off"" policy on Sherlock is now over and he plans to kill him, no matter what Moriarty wants.

Irene and Sherlock plan to hit the road. But, when she disrobes to change her clothes Sherlock notices that a tell-tale birthmark on her back is not there any more. He realizes that she had it removed. And then deduces that she is working for Moriarty. He wants to know when she started, if their whole relationship was a lie. She says for him not to overthink it and that he's inventing a reason not to go away with her. She says when he realizes the mistake he's made to not seek her out because she never wants to see him again.

Sherlock goes home and is confronted by Isaac, who shoots him. Sherlock manages to get the gun away from him. Isaac says that he and Sherlock have met once before, he was looking at him through the sniper scope in when John Douglas was killed. They fight, Sherlock runs upstairs, barricades the room and attempts to escape. He asks Isaac why he didn't kill him before with the sniper rifle. Isaac tells him that he used to be under orders not to kill Sherlock, but now that ""she"" had tried to have him killed, he was going to kill him. When Sherlock asks ""She?"", Isaac is shot from behind, and Irene walks in, gun drawn. Now speaking with an English accent, she says, ""I bet you wish you'd run away with me when you had the chance."" Lightbulb. Irene is Moriarty."

So, there you have it, Irene Adler is actually Moriarty and she's got a gun pointed at Sherlock.

As he lies on the ground writhing from the gunshot wound to his shoulder she monologues about how she seduced him, toyed with him, studied him, was annoyed by him because his work with Scotland Yard was messing up several of her assassination plans, fascinated by him because he was so brilliant, but not as brilliant as she is. She won't kill him because she considers him a work of art and she loves art and says he's not the threat she expected him to be, proved by his drug addiction. He believes that she thinks he's close to undermining one of her plots again. She tells him simply to let her win. And if he doesn't he will hurt him, worse than she has before. She leaves.

Watson returns home and he fills her in as she removes the bullet and stitches him up. She says he needs painkillers, the non-addictive kind. He thinks the pain gives him clarity. He also says the truth has been liberating.

Through a series of clues they deduce that Irene/Moriarty is in town to make sure a Greek national named Theophilus kills the ruler of Macedonia's son. If she achieves this goal she will make a billion dollars thanks to an investment in Macedonian currency. (Macedonia is set to join the EU and begin using the Euro. But if a famous Greek national commits this murder than there will be an uproar that will likely mean they won't join the EU.)

Gregson is worried that an injured, devastated Holmes should be benched from the investigation. Watson says to give him some slack and she'll let him know when he needs to be stopped.

Irene/Moriarty tricks Watson into thinking her mother is in the hospital and strong arms her into a meeting. She's curious to know why Holmes is interested in Watson, how she fits in his life. Watson gives her nothing but awesome attitude.

They trail the Greek national, discover that Irene/Moriarty has kidnapped his daughter and this is how she is going to get him to commit the murder. They figure this all out as Theophilus is heading to kill the Macedonian ruler. They are too late, the ruler's bodyguard is working for Irene/Moriarty. He kills the leader and his wife and the bodyguard kills Theophilus.

When they interrogate the bodyguard he refuses to cop to anything regarding Irene/Moriarty. Sherlock freaks out they fight and Watson talks him off the ledge. She tells him to ""let her win.""

Sherlock ditches his security and finally arrives home. He tells Bell that he's going to take a shower. Bell gets a call that a drug dealer was beaten and robbed by a British man near Sherlock's home. Worried that he's relapsed Bell busts the door down. Sherlock is lying on the floor, passed out, a syringe lying nearby. He has overdosed.

Irene/Moriarty comes to visit him in the hospital and gloat and then offers him a chance to run away with her and live a life he could never have dreamed of. He said they both made the same mistake, they fell in love and it made them stupid. And then he lowers the boom. Watson ""solved"" Moriarty. The whole overdose was a charade. They knew she would come to the hospital. They set the trap and she fell into it. Watson and Gregson enter the room and bust her. Her billion dollar windfall has been frozen.

Back on the roof of the apartment Holmes shows Watson something incredible. The bee in the box he received early in the year that was totally unique was not supposed to be able to breed with other kinds of bees. But Holmes added the bee to his bee colony on the roof and, lo and behold, it bred. He shows her the birth of the first offspring with a magnifying glass. It has to be classified as an entirely new species and he gets to name it and he's calling it ""Euglassia Watsonia."" Awww, he named the bee after her. She sits and watches as more bees are born."

Flint accuses Billy of not trusting him anymore. Billy wonders about how Flint has lied to the crew, but Flint plays it off as something that a good captain needs to do to maintain morale. Billy asks about Mrs Barlow, but Flint claims that she is just a Puritan woman who he has taken as a lover.

Jack Rackham, Vane, and Anne Bonny, arrive at Noonan's brothel and inform the madame that they are the new owners.

Eleanor wonders about why Scott would betray her and returns to her offices where she finds John Silver handcuffed to the injured Randal. Outside her office, her father informs a crowd that he is a wanted fugitive and tells them that Captain Bryson liquidated their holdings and that their business there will be ended.

Looking to gain another knot of speed, Flint orders the raising of the topgallants, an act which Mr Degroot feels jeopardizes the ship. Billy supports the Captain's order and they gain the needed speed.

Mr Guthrie tells Eleanor that their criminal business is ended and that he intends to throw his lot in with the landlords with whom he has been cultivating relationships. He asks Eleanor to swallow her pride and join them, but she refuses. Meanwhile, an angry crowd grows outside her offices, looking to get back whatever money they can. Captain Hornigold has his men protecting her offices and urges her to scrape together whatever money she can to settle her outstanding debts.

Billy Bones lays out to the crew their plan of attack. As they approach, Bryson will likely turn his ship to fire on them. Since they are outgunned they cannot trade fire with him and so will go straight at him. But to allow them to board they will have to get Bryson to turn his ship so that it runs alongside theirs. Billy informs them that Mr Beauclerque will ""convince"" Bryson to do so. Billy has also informed Dufresne, the ships accountant, that all hands will need to take part in the boarding, including him. To steady the man's nerves, Billy tells him that no one on the ship has ever died on their first time boarding.

Bryson turns his ship and opens fire. As he does so, Mr Beauclerque, perched in the crow's nest with a rifle, shoots the man at the Andromache's wheel. When another replaces him, Beauclerque shoots him. Eventually, the Andromache turns and the Walrus comes alongside her.

The pirates leap across the gap between the two ships and begin to board. Terrified, Dufresne goes as well. One of the Andormache's defenders points a pistol at him and pulls the trigger, but it misfires. The two men wrestle and Dufresne ends up biting out the man's jugular before passing out. He is found, covered in blood, by Billy Bones.

Back at Nassau, Eleanor has called together a meeting of several captains. She proposes to start a new trading consortium using her contacts and their ships to move trade. She argues that the captains there, who own large ships but are poor pirates, will earn more money as traders. Eleanor asks Hornigold to bless their operation in order to get people to sell to them. Hornigold says that he will only do so if she agrees to lift her ban on Vane. Eleanor angrily refuses.

Aboard the Andromache, the Walrus' crew begins searching the ship. Bryson and many of his men are barricaded below decks. They shoot several of the Walrus crew who approach their hiding place. Flint is informed that Bryson has cut the link between the steering wheel and the rudder. Bryson decides to deliver his terms. He goes below decks to where a number of slaves are chained in the hold. Among them is Mr Scott. Bryson says that Guthrie ordered him to get rid of Scott. They kill a couple of slaves until one of them agrees to act as a messenger.

Back at Nassau, John Silver advises Eleanor to give up the ban on Vane. He says that it's not worth giving up everything she's built to punish Vane.

Gates lays out the situation to Flint: Bryson's men are barricaded in a section of the ship with walls and ceiling as thick as the outer hull. It's also right next to a powder magazine and so they cannot blow their way in without risking the whole ship.

Dufresne is going through Bryson's papers. He tells Billy that he has remembered a crew member who died on his first boarding. Billy names a half dozen others as well, indicating that he had lied to buck up Dufresne's spirits. Dufresne thanks him. Billy then notices a letter on Bryson's desk addressed to Miranda Barlow and pockets it.

The slave messenger emerges from the hold. Communicating through an African member of the Walrus' crew, he relays a message from Bryson. The message says that before Bryson left he sent a message to the Captain of the ship Scarborough, telling him where to find them. A sail is spotted on the horizon. Just then, the slave lights a grenade and rushes toward Flint. Billy shoots him dead and the man's dead body muffles the grenade blast."

At the Avengers Tower, the Avengers minus the hulk tale Loki and the Tesseract down the elevator to the lobby The future Ant-Man and Tony Stark try to steal the Tesseract, and it ends up knocked over by Loki. Loki grabs it and teleports away.

In the Gobi Desert, Loki ends up falling into the sand after materializing in mid-air and falling. Several local tribesmen approach him, and Loki gets up on a rock outcropping and declares who he is. A portal opens and three Time Variance Authority police--Minutemen--come through it. They find the nearby tesseract, and Loki goes over and tells them not to touch it. Another officer, Hunter B-15, comes through and declares Loki a ""variant"". B-15 arrests Loki on behalf of the TVA for crime against the sacred timeline.

Loki isn't impressed, and tells them it's their last chance. B-15 hits him in the mouth with her baton, slowing him down to 1/16th speed, and puts a collar on him. When Loki collapses, the officers pick him up and B-15 tells the other officer to reset the timeline. As he plants a reset charge and activates it, B-15 picks up the Tesseract and takes Loki to the TVA base. Loki tries to run, but B-15 uses a remote and the collar it controls to reset Loki back to where he was. He tries to run again, and B-15 brings him back again.

B-15 has a clerk, Casey, enter the Tesseract into evidence. Loki tells Casey to be careful with the Tesseract as B-15 leads him off and shoves him into a cell with a robot. The robot disintegrates Loki's Asgardian clothing and then a trapdoor drops him into an office below. Loki is clothed in a gray prison jumpsuit, and another clerk at a desk shoves a pile of paper at Loki and tells him to verify it's everything Loki has ever said.

Loki finally signs and falls through another trapdoor, and a clerk has Loki testify that he's an organic being and possesses a soul. Once Loki does, the clerk tells him to move through an archway that will melt him from the inside if he is a robot. The archway takes a picture of Loki's temporal aura and a guard tells Loki to take a ticket. There's one other prisoner there who arrived when Loki did, and Loki takes a ticket on the guard's orders.

As Loki moves through the barriers, an animated presentation with Miss Minutes tells him that he's at the TVA and it's her job to catch Loki up before he stands trial for his crimes. She explains that there was a multiversal war and hundreds of warring timelines, and then three Timekeepers reorganized the universe into a single timeline, the sacred timeline. Now the Timekeepers preserve the proper flow of time for everyone and everything, but ""variants"" veer off the created path, people like Loki. They create a nexus event, which could lead to another multiversal war.

The Timekeepers created the TVA to deal with variants, setting time back on its proper path. Since the variant doesn't have a place in the timeline anymore, they have to stand trial for their offenses.

The other prisoner protests and a guard disintegrates him because he doesn't have his ticket. Loki quickly produces his.

In a church in Aix-En Province, France, in 1549, TVA Agent Mobius examines several dead Minutemen. Another Minuteman informs Mobius that when they arrive to investigate a nexus event, someone killed them. Mobius notes that the stab wounds appear consistent with the others on dead Minutemen, and the reset charge is gone. A Minuteman notes that it's the sixth attack in the last week, and a young local boy comes in.

Mobius approaches the boy and asks him if he saw who killed the Minutemen. The boy points at a nearby painted window showing the Devil, and Mobius says that the devil is afraid of them and they'll put the boy back where he belongs. The boy smiles, revealing blue tainted teeth, and Mobius asks what caused it. In response, the boy takes out a stick of blue gum and Mobius realizes the ""devil"" gave it to the boy.

The Minuteman warns Mobius that the timeline is near redline and they have to go. Mobius has the boy go outside, and as the Minutemen set a reset charge, a clerk portals in and shows Mobius the file on Loki, saying Mobius will want to see it.

B-15 brings Loki into a courtroom, and Judge Ravonna Renslayer says that he's charged with numerous sequence violations. Loki says that a god doesn't plead, and says that the Avengers are the ones who traveled through time. Mobius comes in and takes a seat, as Loki tell Ravonna that she should give him a taskforce to go after the Avengers. Ravonna says what the Avengers did what was supposed to happen, and Loki escaping was not, according to the Timekeepers.

Loki says that he should talk to the Timekeepers, but Ravonna says that they're busy dictating the proper flow of time. When he tries to teleport away, Loki discovers that his powers don't work. Ravonna tells him that magic powers don't work in the TVA, finds him guilty, and sentences him to be reset.

As Minutemen take Loki away, Mobius approaches the bench. Ravonna warns Mobius that what he's thinking is a bad idea, and if anything goes sideways it's on him. Mobius takes Loki to his office via a balcony overlooking the majestic TVA base. They then take an elevator down, and Mobius introduces himself. Mobius explains that he's taking Loki somewhere they can talk, and they both know that Loki loves to talk.

Mobius gets a baton from a guard and leads Loki into Mobius' office. Loki tries to attack Mobius, and Mobius uses a remote to move Loki back to where he started. Mobius has Loki sit down and then explains that he specialized in the pursuit of dangerous variants, and Loki isn't one of them. If Loki answers his questions honestly, then maybe Mobius can give Loki something he wants.

Starting with his first questions, Mobius asks Loki what he'll do if he returns. Loki says that he'll reclaim his throne, and Mobius wonders why someone with so much range just wants to rule.

Mobius then plays a film of some of Loki's ""greatest hits"". The agent points out that for someone ""born to rule"", Loki loses a lot. It might even be in his nature. When Loki notes that he killed Coulson, Mobius remind him that the Avengers united to avenge Coulson's death at Loki's hands. Mobius asks Loki if he enjoys hurting people, and Loki insists that he's a liberator.

The agent says that Loki is good at doing awful things and getting away, and plays a film of Loki posing as ""Mr. Cooper"", a passenger on a jetliner, hijacking the plane, jumping out with a bag of money. Heimdall teleports Loki away as he falls. Loki tries leave, disgusted with the conversation, and Mobius rewinds Loki back to his chair.

Loki asks Mobius what he wants, and Mobius says that he wants Loki to be honest about why he does what he does. Unimpressed, Loki says that the TVA is an illusion conjured by the weak to inspire fear. He insists that his choices are his own, and Mobius shows Loki a clip of him dominating a crowd in Berlin. Loki insists that when he has ultimate power, it will be cause of what he did, not because it was supposed to happen or because the TVA allowed it to happen. He dismisses the TVA as a footnote in his ascent.

Mobius explains that if Loki hadn't reacquired the Tesseract, he would have been taken to a cell on Asgard. The agent explains that the TVA can see Loki's future, and in the film it shows Loki's mother Frigga confronting Loki and then Loki sending the Dark Elves to kill Frigga. Loki insists that Mobius is lying, and Mobius tells Loki that it's the proper flow of time, and it happens again and again. He asks again if Loki enjoys hurting people, and Loki throws his chair at him in fury.

Mobius rewind Loki back to where he was sitting, but the chair isn't there so Loki falls on the floor. He then tells Loki that he was born to cause pain and suffering and death, and that's how it will always be... so that others can achieve their best versions of themselves. Mobius helps Loki up, and B-15 comes in and asks Mobius what he's doing. Mobius says that he's doing his job, and she says that they have a situation. The agent tells Loki to stay put and leaves with B-15.

Outside, B-15 tells Mobius that talking to the variant is a mistake. She says that they've lost another Minuteman unit, and Mobius goes back in to discover that Loki has escaped... and stole the time rewinder remote from him.

Loki returns to where he was, and spots Casey wheeling a card.

Mobius, B-15, and a squad of Minutemen search for Loki.

Loki slips into the room with Casey's desk, grabs the worker, and shoves him down. The Asgardian tells Casey to give him the Tesseract, and Casey opens his desk drawer and gives Loki the Tesseract. There are dozens of Infinity Stones in the drawer as well, and when Loki sees them, Casey tells him that they get a lot of them and some of the clerks use them as paperweights. Shocked, Loki wonders if the TVA is the greatest power in the universe.

B-15 comes in and Loki uses the twister to twist himself away. B-15 and her men continue their search for Loki.

Loki rewinds back to the office, and rewinds the film of his life to the point where Frigga is dead. He then finds his future where he and Thor meet Odin, and then further to where he and Thor join forces. Loki then plays the moment of his death, when Thanos kills him.

The film ends and Loki chuckles, and B-15 comes in and asks him what's so funny. He attacks B-15, and she easily gets him in arm hold. Loki uses the remote to remove the collar, put in on B-15, and rewind her repeatedly so she never touches him. Loki finally rewinds her out of the room.

Casey tells two Minutemen about his encounter with Loki. B-15 appears in front of them and storm off, disgusted.

Mobius returns to his office and tells Loki that there's nowhere left for Loki to run. Loki figures that he can't go back to his timeline, and says that he doesn't enjoy hurting people but he does it because he has had to. It's part of the illusion, a desperate play for control. Mobius figures that Loki does know himself and says that he doesn't see Loki as a villain.

Loki notes that the Tesseract is useless in the TVA, and Mobius says that he can offer Loki something better than salvation. He explains that a variant has been killing their Minutemen, and he needs Loki to help stop the variant. When Loki wonders why him, Mobius tells him that the variant they're hunting is Loki.

In Salina, OK, in 1858, a squad of Minutemen appear in a field. There's a sword driven into the ground, and the Minutemen confirm that it's anachronistic. There's oil on the ground, and they set a reset charge to ""prune"" the timeline. One of them spots the hooded Variant a few hundred feet away. He drops a lamp on the ground, and it bursts igniting the oil.

The Minutemen are set on fire and die, and the Variant picks up the reset charge."

A fair woman asked what's going on, and points out that they're not dressed right. The Minutemen ignore her and detect the Variant at a nearby tent, and approach it. The four Minutemen go inside, and music booms out of the loudspeakers. The commander, C-20, removes her helmet and attacks the other three, and the Variant--mind-controlling her--aids her.

The commander drops unconscious while fighting one Minuteman, and the Variant comes up behind him and stabs him to death with a sword. The Variant then uses the Minutemen's own equipment to open a portal, and leaves with the unconscious C-20.

Loki is at his new desk reviewing time rules with a projection of Miss Minutes. He asks if Miss Minutes is alive or a recording, and then swats at her with a magazine. The hologram jumps away and jumps back into her computer. Mobius comes up and tells Loki that there's been an attack. Loki puts on the suit that Mobius gives him They meet with Hunter B-15, who tells Mobius that C-20's team went dark just after they jumped into the 1985 branch. They don't know which variant attacked the team, and Loki insists that it's the lesser kind.

B-15 points out that ""Variant"" is printed on the back of Loki's jacket, and says that she doesn't want people to forget who he is. Mobius tells the team that they're looking for a variant Loki, and projects holograms of all the Lokis they've pruned. Loki lectures them on the difference in his powers, and Mobius says that they're going to take Loki along as an ""expert"". Mobius tells Loki that he knows Loki won't betray them, because Loki knows they can capture him and it won't get him any closer to the Time Keepers.

The team goes to 1985 and locates the time nexus, and Mobius explains that they have to show up in real time because of the unstable nature of the nexus. They go into the tent, find C-20's helmet, and figure the Variant has taken her hostage even though the Variant never has before. Loki tells the team that if they leave the tent, they'll end up like the dead Minutemen. He says that he can sense his own schemes, and tells them that the Variant wants them to look for C-20, and it's a trap.

Time is approaching the redline, and Loki says that the Variant wants him. He offers to deliver them the Variant, but he tells Mobius that he needs assurances that he won't be disintegrated when the job is done. Loki says that he needs to speak to the Time Keepers at once. Mobius figures that Loki is playing games and there is no trap, and tells the team to set the reset charges. Once they're done, they depart and the charge eradicates the timeline.

Back at the TVA, Mobius goes to Ravonna's office to meet with her. She points out that Loki is stubborn, subordinate, and unpredictable. Mobius figures that understanding ""their"" Loki helps them understand the Variant and get closer to him. He suggests that Loki might have changed, and Ravonna says that the Time Keepers are monitoring every aspect of the case, and they want the Variant caught.

Ravonna tells Mobius that it will be his last chance with Loki. As Mobius leaves, he tells Ravonna that if it doesn't work, he'll delete Loki himself. The agent goes out into the waiting room where Loki is, and they leave together. Loki claims that he was running a triple bluff, but Mobius doesn't want to hear it. Mobius tells Loki that Loki is there to help him capture the Variant, and figured Loki would help because he can't take that his variant is better.

Mobius figures that Loki is trying to get to the Time Keepers and take control of the TVA. Loki wonders why Mobius is stick his neck out for him, and Mobius tells Loki that either he feels sorry for Loki, or wants to catch the Variant.

Mobius wants Loki to go over the Variant's case files and then give Mobius his unique perspective, in case there's something they missed. The agent leaves Loki at a desk with the case files and goes to get a snack, and Loki reads the files. He talks to himself loudly about what he's found, and a nearby clerk shushes him. Loki turns and shushes her back

Loki approaches the head clerk and asks for files pertaining to the creation of the TVA, and she tells him that they're classified. All the other relevant files he asks for are classified as well, and she takes him to the only files that he can read; the one about the Variant.

Going back to his desk to study the files, Loki finds a reference to the destruction of Asgard. He reads the file about his civilization's destruction , takes the files to Mobius in the cafeteria, and tells the agent that he found something. Loki points out that he could go to Asgard right before its destruction and do anything he wanted to do, because the apocalypse is coming. It can be any apocalypse and it won't matter what Loki does, because the timeline won't branch because it gets destroyed anyway. Loki figures the Variant is hiding in an apocalypse and the TVA wouldn't notice.

Mobius concedes that it's a good theory, but refuses to take Loki out to test his theory. Loki assures Mobius that he wouldn't stab him in the back because it got old, and says that he loves to be right.

The agent takes Mobius to Pompeii in 79 AD, and Mobius scans for variance energy. He warns that if Loki is wrong, anything they could do would create a huge branch in the timeline, and says that they should start small by making bird noises.

Loki runs to a wagon, gets on it, and shoos the goats inside out. He introduces himself as the God Loki, and that he and Mobius are TVA agents. He yells that all of the residents are about to die when Vesuvius erupts in a short time, and that he's from the future. Vesuvius erupts, and the residents run while Loki yells that nothing matters. Mobius confirms that there's zero variance energy, and the ash cloud from the volcano approaches

Mobius and Loki return to the TVA, and they look for a disaster with no survivors. Loki falls asleep, and Mobius wakes him up so they can go for a walk. They go back to the cafeteria, and Mobius talks about the beauty of jet skis like the one advertised in the magazine on his desk. He admits that he doesn't have one, but it'd be fun. Mobius reads it to remind him of what they're fighting before.

The agent says that he accepts what is, and they discuss the chaos of creation. and he's lucky that chaos he emerged into gave him a purpose, and it's real because Mobius believe it's real. Loki insists that they're the only ones at the TVA who have free will, and wonders how it all ends. Mobius says that it's a work in progress, and the Time Keepers are untangling the epilogue that is to come. Loki says that is order, and sounds boring, and says that he knows that no one bad is truly bad... and no one good is ever truly good. Mobius tells Loki that he's very clever and walks off.

Mobius goes back to the files and checks the one about the candy box the Variant left at the cathedral. The candy, Kablooie, was only sold on Earth in in 2047 and 2051. If they cross-reference those years with apocalyptic events, they'll figure out where the Variant is hiding. Loki finds a reference to a hurricane in Alabama in 2050, and Mobius asks Ravonna to deploy a task force there. She tells Mobius that trusting Loki isn't a good idea, and Mobius insists that he can handle Loki. Ravonna is finally convinced but warns him that there's not much she can do him if it doesn't work out.

As they go the departure room, Mobius tells Loki that he did good work. He gives Loki his knives, and B-15 passing by takes them from Loki. She calls the task force together and briefs them on Roxxcart, the superstore where they'll be arriving, in Haven Hills. It has a large warehouse that civilians are using to ride out the storm. She tells the Minutemen to stay alert and figures the Variant is planning something by stealing the reset charges, but they don't know what. Loki points out if they see a Loki, they shouldn't kill him.

The hurricane rips through Haven Hills of 2050, and the task force appears outside of the superstore. They go in and Loki uses magic to dry his clothes. The lights flicker, and the Minutemen split up to search the shelters. B-15 insists that Loki stays with her, and Mobius objects. Loki tells Mobius that it's fine and he understands that he has to understand the TVA's trust. Mobius reluctantly leaves with the others.

The Variant watches the task force on the superstore's security monitors, sets a 20-minute timer on one of the consoles, and leaves.

Loki and B-15 move through the store, and Loki tries to chat with her. She tells him to shut up and they find a teenager examining a shelf with plants on it. The teenager says that there's a hurricane sale, and Loki tells B-15 that the teenager could be him. B-15 goes over to the boy, who grabs her wrist and a green glow spreads from him to her, and then he collapses. The Variant, speaking through B-15's body, identifies Loki.

Mobius and the others find the refugees, and one local says that if they're National Guard then they should be transporting the refuges out. They find C-20 sitting in an office, chanting to herself.

Loki tells the Variant that her possessing B-15 is cowardly, and she says that it's almost as cowardly as Loki working for the TVA. He insists that he's working for himself, and a clerk find them. The Variant touches him and jumps into his body, and B-15 collapses. Loki continues taunting the variant, asking if she's too scared to meet him face to face, and says that he has an offer for the Variant. Loki says that he's going to overthrow the Time Keepers and could use a qualified lieutenant.

The Variant checks the clerk's name badge, and tells Loki to call him ""Randy"". Loki says that he's been trying to help the Variant, but the Variant refuses Loki's offer and walks off. Loki follows him, while the real Variant lurks in the shadows and prepares a reset charge.

C-20 mutters about it being real, and Mobius asks her what she means. She says that she gave away how the Variant could find the Time Keepers.

B-15 wakes up when one of the Minutemen with Mobius calls her.

Loki asks Randy what he wants, and Randy says that it doesn't matter because Loki is too late. Loki notices a reset charge planted and figures the Variant lured them there so he could blow up the superstore and team along with it. The Variant possesses the body of a burly man and attacks Loki, and thanks Loki for helping him stall for time.

Loki stands up and dodges the Variant's next punch, and they fight hand-to-hand. The Variant throws Loki down.

B-15 finds Mobius and tells him that she lost Loki.

The possessed man plants another charge, and Loki recovers and walks toward the man and asks what it's about. The man laughs, tells Loki to brace himself, and collapses. The real and hooded Variant is standing behind Loki, who turns to face her. She removes her hood to reveal that she's a woman, and tells Loki that her plot isn't about him.

The timer counts down to zero and the lights go out. It initializes the charges scattered throughout the store and drop through small portals, and Mobius and the others see them.

At the TVA, the clerks detect dozens of branches shooting off of the Sacred Timeline.

Ravonna and her men get word of the fracture and head out into the timeline.

Lady Loki removes a monitor from the timer, and leaves via a portal, waving goodbye to Loki as she leaves. Mobius and the others arrive, and Loki sees them and goes through the portal after the Variant."

Sylvie isn't impressed, but C-20 says that the drinks seem fine. Sylvie talks about ""brain freeze"" freezing someone's memories in place, and C-20 take the challenge. She takes a drink from her ice-cold margarita, and doesn't remember when Sylvie asks her how many people are guarding the Time Keepers.

C-20 suddenly realizes that it's now night time instead of daytime, and Sylvie tells C-20 that they're best friends and asks C-20 again how many people are guarding the Time Keepers. C-20 starts to answer, but then remembers the bar and doesn't know Sylvie. Sylvie tells C-20 that she's probably just tired.

In the real world in the superstore security room, Sylvia enchants C-20 mind with an illusion, and Sylvie asks how she finds the elevator leading to the Time Keepers. As C-20 describes it, Sylvie sees a TVA squad approaching on the monitors.

Sylvie enters the TVA via a portal, walks down the hallway, and uses her enchanted touch on a Minuteman that she comes up to. Her touch has no effect, and the Minuteman attacks her. Sylvie fights back and disintegrates him with his own baton, and a group of three Minutemen come running. She takes them out in hand-to-hand.

Loki arrives through the portal and realizes where he is. He gets his daggers and goes looking for Sylvie, finds the unconscious Minutemen that she attacked.

Sylvie finds the elevator and knocks out the two Minutemen guarding it. Loki arrives and they prepare to fight as Sylvie draws her sword. He says that he has a few questions, and asks if she's sure she's a Loki. They fight and Loki tells Sylvie that he thought they could work together. He tells her that now he sees that she lacks vision, and when he grabs her Sylvia fights back.

Loki and Sylvie stop when Ravonna and two more Minutemen arrive. Sylvie puts her sword to Loki's throat and tells Ravonna that she'll kill him if Ravonna comes any closer. Ravonna tells Sylvie to go for it and runs forward to attack. Sylvie uses her tempad to create a portal beneath her and Loki, dropping them into a tent. The pad unit they used is damaged, and Sylvie grabs it first. Loki teleports behind her, knocks it out, and grabs the pad, then uses his magic to make it disappear.

Sylvie recovers and tells Loki that he doesn't know how to use the pad, and takes offense when he calls her a Loki. As they prepare to fight, a piece of rock comes through the ceiling and hits the floor between them. They go out and the planet they're on, Lamentis-1 in 20777, is being hit by falling meteor. Sylvie says that Lamentis the moon is about to crash into the planet overhead and destroy itself. As they dodge the meteors, Sylvie says that it's the worse apocalypse that had its coordinates stored on the pad, and they take cover beneath a truck. They run to a mining shack and take shelter inside, and Sylvie touches Loki's neck and uses her power.

Loki wonders what she's doing, then realizes that she's trying to enchant him. He says that it won't work because his mind is too strong, and they both draw their blades. Loki asks if they're going to fight again, and suggests that they call a truce to get the tempad working. Sylvie says that Loki needs her to recharge the pad, and figures that's why Loki helped her avoid the meteors. Loki agrees, and Sylvie says that as soon as she gets the pad on, she's going back to the TVA to finish what she started.

Sylvie says that there's power for the pad somewhere on the moon, and once they have it they can travel through time and space. She goes outside and Loki goes after her. He asks her what the plan is, and she says that there's a town nearby. Loki calls Sylvie ""Variant"", and she takes offense and tells him not to do it. She points out that Loki went to work for the ""boring"" TVA, and Loki insists that he's just a consultant.

Loki points out that Sylvie's plan was to create the ultimate power vacuum, and then walk away, and Sylvie doesn't respond to his barb. They arrive in the town, which appears uninhabited. Sylvie tells Loki that they have about twelve hours until the moon is destroyed, and things on Lamentis are only going to get worse.

The pair find a lit sign on a building, and Sylvie tells Loki to hand over the pad. He tells her that he's not giving it to her, and she'll have to try harder. Sylvie tells him that they'll need a large power source. They leave the town and come to a house, and Sylvie draws her sword and kicks in the front door. The woman inside shoots Sylvia with a blaster, knocking Sylvie back and on the ground.

Loki yells an apology, and the woman says that she enjoyed shooting Sylvie. He says that he did as well, and insists that they meant the woman no harm. The woman doesn't believe him, and Loki looks in, sees a photo of the woman and her husband Patrice, and uses his magic to take on the husband's appearance. Loki steps out and tells the woman that she's as beautiful as ever, and the woman shoots him back with the blaster.

The woman yells that Patrice never said that nice in 30 years, comes out, and asks what they want with her. Sylvie asks where everyone is, and the woman homesteader says that they're at the evacuation vessel. The female Loki figures the vessel would have enough energy to power the pad, and tells them that it's at the train station on the edge of town, but they'll never get a ticket. Sylvie heads there and Loki follows her.

At the station, people are lined up waiting for a ticket to evacuate on the train. Loki and Sylvie arrive, and Sylvie tells Loki that she's going to enchant a guard, have him lead them through the crowd, and have him shoot anyone that interferes. Loki says that he's doing it his way, and uses his illusion to don himself in a guard's uniform.

Loki takes Sylvie to the guard post, treating her like his prisoner. The guards let them through, but the next guard stops them and asks for their ticket. When Loki's attempt to bluff fails, Sylvie touches the guard and enchants him, and under his control he tells his superior coming over that headquarters radioed over a request for Loki and Sylvie that morning. The two guards let Loki and Sylvie through, and they sit down in a booth in a dining car.

Sylvie argues that Loki didn't have a plan, and when she yawns she says that she can't sleep around untrustworthy people. They talk about Loki's mother, Frigga, and he says that she taught him magic. Sylvie asks what Frigga was like, and Loki says that she was good, decent, and a queen of Asgard. Loki admits that he was adopted, and asks about Loki's mother. Sylvie says that she barely remembers her, and Loki reminiscences about his childhood with Frigga.

Loki demonstrates some of his magic for Sylvie, conjuring miniature fireworks. He says that Frigga was the kind of person he wanted someone to believe in him, and finally says that Frigga is dead. Loki asks where Sylvie learned to enchant people, and she says that she taught herself. He refuses to let her demonstrate on him, and a waitress comes over and offers them champagne.

After taking both glasses, Loki offers a toast to the end of the world and drinks. Sylvie brings up the subject of love, and Loki asks if Sylvie has someone, and they both admit that they ever had anything real. Loki says that love is something... he might have to have another drink to think about. Sylvie warns him that hijacking a civilization's power source isn't going to be easy, and they should rest. Loki tells her that he'll rest his way.

The train leaves, and Sylvie dozes off. She wakes up to find Loki leading a song, and he switches to a slower song and looks pensive. Loki switches back to the livelier song, then offers a toast to Sylvie. Sylvie goes over, figures Loki is drunk, and asks where his illusory uniform is. She reminds him that they're supposed to be laying low, and says that she saw some people looking weirdly at Loki. Loki says that he as an answer to her earlier question, conjures an illusion of a dagger, and says that love is like it.

Sylvie tells him that it's a horrible metaphor, and Loki makes the illusion disappear. A man who left comes back with guards, and the man points out Loki. One of the guards from the gate demands to see the couple's tickets, and Loki conjures fireworks. The guards aren't impresses, and Loki fights back when they try to lead him away. Sylvie joins the fight, and Loki throws his dagger at a guard who grabs Sylvie... and misses the guard and almost hits her.

Another guard attacks Loki, who kicks the guard out a window. Sylvie breaks free as two more guards grabs Loki and throw him out the window. She jumps out the window to get the tempad,

Loki gets up and finds Sylvie where she jumped off the train. She gets up, draws her sword, and tells Loki to give her the tempad. He conjures it to his hand but they discover that it's broken, and figures that they can fix it. Loki drops the pieces on the ground, and Sylvie tells him that he's a clown. She says that she's hedonistic, more than Loki, but never at the expense of the mission. Loki tells her that her mission is doomed and she can't beat the TVA.

Sylvie storms off and screams in rage, then sit down. Loki comes over and sits down next to Sylvie, and asks if her scream made her feel better. Sylvie says that did and Loki should try it sometime, and he asks what they do. She points out that Loki broke the tempad and the planet is about to crash into Lamentis. Sylvie explains that the evacuation ark is destroyed because it never leaves, and Loki points out that it never had them on it. They agree to hijack it and get off Lamentis before it's destroyed.

Loki and Sylvie walk along the train tracks, and Loki tries to get Sylvie to explain her powers. She refuses, and Loki tries to find out more about her. Sylvie says that she wants to use her secrets as a tactical advantage, and Loki says that he just needs to know that he can trust her. Convinced, Sylvie explains that she needs to make physical contact, and has problems with stronger minds. She creates a connection by creating a fantasy illusion from their memories.

Sylvie says that C-20's mind was so strong that she had to pull a memory from before C-20 joined the TVA. When Loki wonders what she means, Sylvie explains that C-20 used to be a regular person on Earth. Loki points out that he was told all the TVA workers were created, and Sylvie explains that all of the workers are Variants.

Before Loki can pursue the matter, the duo arrive at the city. They spot the ark ahead of the crowd, and Sylvie figures that they'll get to the ark by going around. Rioters fill the street, and meteors rain down. They go into a bar, fighting off rioters, and then continue on into the street. They approach the ark, and it's destroyed by debris."

A young Sylvie is playing in Asgard when Ravonna and three Minutemen portal in. Ravonna confirms that Sylvie is the variant they're looking for, and the Minutemen grab the girl while Ravonna says that they're arresting Sylvie for crimes against the Sacred Timeline. As they haul Sylvie away, the Minutemen activate a reset charge.

In the TVA, Ravonna takes Sylvie into the processing room. Another prisoner is hauled away, and Sylvie is processed and brought to the judge. Sylvie steals Ravonna's tempad, creates a portal, and escapes.

The Present

Ravonna meets with the three Time Keepers. Afterward, she leaves the chamber and Mobius asks Ravonna if she's okay. Ravonna says that she's not okay, and they blame her for the Lokis escaping. She says that the Time Keepers are all that stand between them and a temporal calamity, and Mobius says that if the Time Keepers want him to find the escapees, he needs access to C-20.

After Ravonna insists that it's impossible, Mobius says that he needs to find out what C-20 meant when she said repeatedly, ""It's real,"" and what else she saw when she was with Sylvie. Ravonna tells him that Sylvie enchanted C-20 and scrambled her mind, and doesn't want people to panic. She warns that they're all in danger and tells Mobius to find the Lokis, and then leaves.

On Lamentis, meteors from the planet crash down on the moon. Loki finds Sylvie sitting alone outside the city and sits down with her. Loki apologizes, and Sylvie says that she remembers a little of her life in Asgard before she was taken, and she was born the Goddess of Mischief. As soon as that created a big enough detour from the Sacred Timeline, the TVA took her prisoner and erased her reality. Sylvie stole a tempad, escaped, and ran for a long time. Everywhere she went created a nexus event and drew the attention of the TVA, and she learned to hide in the ends of a thousand worlds. Sylvie figures that she'll die on Lamentis.

At the TVA, the analysts are unable to locate the Lokis. B-15 asks Mobius if there's news on C-20, and he says that there isn't. The Hunter insists that they to find the Lokis, and Mobius tells her that they will.

Meteors continue raining down on Lamentis, and Loki and Sylvie watch. Loki figures that what makes a Loki a Loki is that they survive no matter what, and points out that Sylvie survived and almost took down the TVA. He says that she's amazing and takes Sylvie's hand.

The Analysts get a temporal lock.

A meteor crashes on the horizon, and the blast wave heads toward the Lokis. Loki and Sylvie brace themselves and smile at each other.

The TVA determine that the new nexus they locked onto is a major upheaval.

Minutemen arrive via portal and take Loki and Sylvie to the TVA, putting collars on them. The Minutemen take Sylvie away, and Mobius and Loki argue about who betrayed who. They take Loki to Mobius' theater and Mobius tells Loki that he's an asshole and a bad friend. A portal opens, and Loki tells Mobius that the TVA is lying to him. Mobius ignores Loki's accusation and has the Minutemen shove Loki through the portal

Loki finds himself in a plaza in Asgard. Sif comes out with part of her hair cut off from one of Loki's pranks, says that Loki did what happened, and slaps him. She tells him that he deserved to be alone and always will be, and beats Loki, and then walks away. Loki figures that he's in a ""bad memory prison"", and he was just having fun. The sequence repeats itself and Sif beats Loki again. Irritated, Loki figures that he's in a time loop. The sequence repeats itself, and Loki tells Sif that she's a recreation of a past event created by the TVA. He asks her to help him escape, and Sif beats him again.

Mobius visits Ravonna in her office and says that he wanted to meet with Sylvie while Loki is in the time cell. Ravonna refuses and tells Mobius to stick with Loki. He says that he thinks he can figure out what caused the spike if he works them against each other, but Ravonna refuses, saying that Sylvie is too dangerous.

Mobius leaves and goes to the theater where B-15 and her men are standing guard over Sylvie. B-15 asks Mobius if Loki said anything to him, and Mobius repeats Loki's accusation that the TVA is lying to him. He wonders why B-15 asked, and she claims that she's just doing her job.

When the sequence repeats itself again, Loki asks Sif to stop and says that he's a horrible person. Sif hesitates, and Loki tells her that he craves attention because he's a narcissist. Loki admits that he's scared of being alone, and Sif repeats her phrase of how he's alone and always will be. She walks off, and Mobius comes in and asks Loki if he's ready to talk.

Mobius portals Loki back to the theater, and tells him to expand on what Loki said earlier. Loki asks for his freedom before saying anything further, and Mobius figures that Loki was lying to him to barter for his freedom. Mobius asks how long Loki has been working for Sylvie, and Loki says that Sylvie is irritating and difficult and tries to hit him all the time.

Loki insists that he and Sylvie aren't partners, and Mobius continues questioning Loki about what caused the nexus event. When Loki refuses to talk, Mobius figures that they've reached a dead-end and prepares to send Loki back into the time loop. To avoid that, Loki lies and says that he was masterminding the entire operation. Loki says that Sylvie came to him on Asgard a long time ago, took her to one of her apocalypses, and they hatched their plan together.

When Mobius wonders what the plan is, Loki says that it's coming along nicely and Sylvie is a pawn. Loki tells Mobius that something big is going to happen and he'll dispose of Sylvie when it does, and Mobius tells him that Sylvie has already been pruned. When Loki asks what happened, Mobius says that Sylvie broke free, tried to escape, and B-15 had to prune her to stop her.

Loki says, ""Good riddance"", and Mobius chuckles and then points out that Loki likes Sylvie. He figures that Loki forming a romantic entanglement to a variant of himself is pure chaos, and Loki is an incredible narcissist. Loki angrily asks if Sylvie is alive, and Mobius says that she is... for now. The god says that his interests and Sylvie's are aligned, and finally tells Mobius that all of the TVA Hunters and Analysts are variants, and the Time Keepers erased their memories.

Explaining, Loki says that the variants can access their memories through enchantment. Mobius doesn't believe Loki, and tells Loki that he's closing the case because he doesn't need Loki anymore. As Minutemen come in and take Loki away, Loki tells Mobius that the latter is the biggest liar because he lies to himself. The Minutemen shove Loki through the portal into the time loop.

B-15 looks at a TVA poster on the wall. It says ""Verify Through Deletion"", and B-15 preps her pruning rod and then goes into Theater 47 where Sylvie is imprisoned. The Hunter puts away her rod and takes out a tempad, and creates a portal, and tells Sylvie to come with her. They go through the portal, Sylvie following B-15.

In Ravonna's office, Ravonna has Mobius sign paperwork and asks if he's good. Mobius says that he is and signs, closing the Loki case. They toast to the end of the case and Ravonna asks Mobius where he would go if he could go anywhere in any time. Mobius asks why she wouldn't let him interrogate Sylvie, and Ravonna points out that Loki got away during Mobius' first interrogation. Ravonna repeats her question, and Mobius dodges answering.

Ravonna tells Mobius that the Time Keepers want to oversee Sylvie's pruning, and want Mobius there. He asks her when she first noticed that C-20 died, and Ravonna insists that it's over and the Time Keepers are happy. Mobius points out that C-20 was fine when he saw her last, and Ravonna wonders what Mobius is getting at.

Mobius says that something seems off, and Ravonna tells him that she's trying to protect him. She didn't want to see Sylvie do anything to him, and she couldn't deal with the same thing happening to Mobius that happened to C-20. Ravonna says that Mobius has been spending too much time with Lokis, and insists that what they're doing matters because they're fighting for their friendship. She tells Mobius that friendship like theirs is uncommon, and they're fighting for it.

Her friend jokingly tells her she gave a good speech. As he asks where Ravonna is going to put her newest trophy, he swaps her tempad for another when she isn't looking. Mobius then excuses himself, saying that he's exhausted from dealing with all the Lokis. He says that he'll see Ravonna later up in the Time Keeper's chamber, and leaves.

B-15 and Sylvie arrive at the Roxxgate Superstore during the hurricane, and B-15 asks what Sylvie showed her when she was in her head earlier. Sylvie says that B-15's life is a lie created by TVA, and that she can only use memories already there. She tells B-15 that the Time Keepers took the Hunter's life from her and the others, and they're variants. Sylvie says that she and B-15 are the same, and B-15 tells Sylvie to show her and holds out her hand.

Sylvie takes B-15's hand and uses her powers. B-15 smiles as she remembers her original life, and remembers that she looked happy. When Sylvie stops, B-15 breaks into tears and asks what now.

Mobius goes to the library stacks for privacy, takes out Ravonna's tempad, and finds a file on C-20. There's also a video of her last interrogation, talking about her memories that Sylvie tapped into of the bar from C-20's previous life and how she had a whole life on the Sacred Timeline, and that she and Ravonna are both variants, and everyone in the TVA. Mobius confirms that Ravonna is there, and pockets the tempad.

Mobius enters Loki's time loop cell and tells Loki that the next nexus event that Loki and Sylvie cause will bring the TVA down. Loki swears that he believes Sylvie didn't put the memories in C-20, and asks if Mobius will trust the word of a friend. Mobius tells Loki that he was right about the TVA from the beginning, and he wants to save Sylvie then he has to trust Mobius. Loki agrees, and Mobius tells Loki that he can be good if he wants to be.

The two men leave the cell via portal into Mobius' theater, and find Ravonna and four Minutemen waiting for them. Ravonna asks for her tempad back from Mobius, and he claims he accidentally picked it up. He asks what the problem is, and then says that if could go to wherever he had a life before the TVA came along, he'd ride on his jet ski. Ravonna tells one of the Minutemen to prune Mobius, and the Minuteman does so.

The Minutemen take Loki to the gold elevator, while Ravonna goes to Sylvie's theater and confirms that B-15 was with the prisoner. B-15 has gone, and Ravonna tells the Minutemen to put an alert out on the Hunter because she's been compromised by Sylvie.

Minutemen take Sylvie to the gold elevator, and Ravonna joins them and Loki. Ravonna tells Loki and Sylvie up in the elevator to the Time Keepers' chamber, and Sylvie asks Ravonna if she remembers her. Ravonna says that she did, and Sylvie asks her why the arrested her. The judge asks why it matters, and Sylvie tells her that it was enough to take her life from her, and figures it was important. Ravonna tells Sylvie that she doesn't remember.

The trio emerge into the chamber where the seated Time Keepers are waiting. Loki dares them to kill him, and Sylvie says that the Keepers are scared of them. As Ravonna uses her rewind device and the collar on Sylvie to keep Sylvie from going forward, B-15 arrives, uses her remote to open the collars, and tosses Sylvie her sword.

The Minutemen on guard knock down B-15 and surround Loki and Sylvie. They fight, and Sylvie tosses Loki her sword to defend himself. She kills one Minuteman with his own rod and then fights Ravonna, who uses her own rod. Sylvie knocks out Ravonna, while Loki kills his opponents. He gives Sylvie her sword back, and she throws it and decapitates one of the Time Keepers. His head comes off, revealing that he's an android.

The remaining two Keepers shut down, and Loki wonders who created the TVA. Loki starts to tell Sylvie something, and says that they'll figure it out. She wonders why, and he says that it's new for him. Before Loki can say anything else, Ravonna recovers and prunes him with her rod. Ravonna lunges at Sylvie, who disarms Ravonna, takes her rod and threatens her with it. Ravonna tells Sylvie to do it, and Sylvie says that she isn't and that Ravonna is going to tell her everything.

Loki wakes up in the ruins of New York City, Avengers Tower in the background. He wonders if he's in Hel and if he's dead, and four Lokis--Boastful, Classic, Kid, and Alligator--are there. Boastful says that Loki will be dead if he doesn't come with them."

Getting to his feet, Loki asks where he is. A giant smoke-like being is approaching them, and Classic tells Loki that they have to go. The five Lokis run away as the creature roars at them.

In the Time Keeper's chamber, Sylvie tells Ravonna to give her her tempad. Ravonna does so, and says that she has no idea who is behind the TVA. Sylvie points out that Ravonna's reality has been destroyed, just like Sylvie's was, and Ravonna tells Sylvie that Loki isn't dead. She says that she's telling Sylvie willingly because she wants to know who is at the top of the TVA as well, and who lied to her.

Sylvie lowers her rod, and Ravonna explains that when the TVA prunes a branches reality, it's impossible to destroy all of its matter. They transfer it to the Void at the end of time, where reality collides and everything stops. Beyond, the Time Keepers are transforming reality into utopia, or so the dogma has it. Ravonna says that nothing ever comes back from the Void, and tells Sylvie that she can help her if Sylvie trusts her. Sylvie considers and then gives Ravonna her tempad back.

In the Void, the five Lokis head away from the being, and Loki yells at them to explain what is going on. Kid conjures a sword on Loki, getting his attention, and then explains that the Void is where TVA dumps everything that they prune. Alioth, the smoke being, makes sure that nothing returns. Classic explains that there are so many of them together because Lokis survive. The variants explain that there's nothing to do in the Void but survive.

The variants move on, and Loki asks why Kid gives the orders and what his nexus event was. Kid says that he killed Thor, leaving Loki speechless. The variant reach a hidden bunker and all six Lokis go inside. Classic asks Loki why he wants to return to the TVA so badly, and Loki says that he wants to live his glorious purpose there.

Ravonna has Miss Minutes access restricted files from the archives, on the beginning of time and the founding of the TVA. Sylvie suggests that there's something at the end of time, beyond the Void, and that it would be impossible to create a nexus event when time is being written. Ravonna warns that it's impossible to get past the void because there's nothing for the tempad to lock onto, and Sylvie says that they go through the Void.

When Ravonna warns that it's impossible, Miss Minutes suggests the prototype Void spacecraft. The AI brings up the file on the spacecraft, and Ravonna tells Sylvie that the spacecraft was designed to withstand the Void. Ravonna suggests that they find the person responsible for TVA and kill him. She offers her hand to Sylvie, who reluctantly takes it.

Miss Minutes says that the spacecraft files are buried deep, and Ravonna admits that she might not have clearance. Sylvie isn't convinced, and Minutemen break in. Sylvie takes cover and Ravonna calls to Sylvie that they know where she hides so she can't run. Ravonna suggests that Sylvie come out and they can talk about where the person behind the TVA betrayed Ravonna.

Ravonna motions the Minutemen forward and offers to put Sylvie in a time loop with good memories. Sylvie says that she has just one good memory, pockets Ravonna's tempad, then prunes herself with the rod. Ravonna tells the Minutemen that Sylvie is dead as well and walks away.

In the bunker, the Lokis drink and Boastful talks about how he vanquished Iron Man and Captain America, claimed the Infinity Stones. Alligator doesn't believe him, and attacks Boastful when Boastful says that Alligator's nexus event was eating the wrong neighbor's cat. Loki wonders how Classic survived Thanos, and Classic explains that he cast a projection of himself that Thanos thought he was killing Thanos. Then Classic hid as debris, drifted in space away from everything, and removed himself from the universe because he realized only pain followed him. He stayed on a remote planet in solitude for a long time, but when he got lonely he left. That was when the TVA found and captured him.

Classic says that their role is as the God of Outcasts, and Loki says that he's going back to the TVA, figuring that the Lokis are good at escaping as well as surviving. When Classic tells Loki that he'll just be brutally murdered, Loki says that if that was his destiny, that will be what happens. He tells the variant Lokis that he's the same as all of them. Loki confirms that none of them have met a female Loki, and Sylvie is different because she's trying to take the TVA down instead of taking it over, and she needs Loki. He figures that if Alioth lives, he can kill it, and could use their help. The other Lokis laugh, and Loki walks out in disgust. He opens the bunker hatch, and finds President Loki and his supporters waiting.

Sylvie wakes up in the Void in an abandoned bus, and makes her way out. Alioth crashes down nearby and Sylvie runs. When it tries to grab her, she uses her enchantment powers on her and gets a brief vision of the end of time beyond the Void. She continues running and a pizza delivery truck drives up ahead of her. It pulls up and Sylvie gets in, and discovers that Mobius is driving. Mobius drives away from the pursuing Alioth.

President and his men enter the bunker, and Boastful admits that he betrayed the other locals and now he's king. When President's men draw their weapons, Boastful is shocked that President would betray him, and President's men turn on him. Alligator leaps on President's hand and bites it off, and the President's men attack. Boastful fights back, while Classic teleports himself, Kid, Loki, and Alligator out.

Outside, Classic complains about the betrayal, and figures that every version of Loki is broken. Loki insists that nothing can change until the TVA is stopped, and Sylvie is the only one he trusts. Kid and Classic finally agree to help Loki, but Classic says that all they'll do is get Loki to Alioth and that's as far as they go.

Mobius escapes Alioth, and tells Sylvie that he thought the TVA were the good guys. Sylvie insists that she did what she had to do, and Mobius apologizes for ""hunting her like a dog"": She figures that Alioth already got Loki, and the only thing that matters is escaping the Void and finding out who is behind the TVA. Mobius wonders how they do that, and Sylvie tells him to turn around because it might hold the key to escaping. Sighing wearily, Mobius turns the truck around.

The four Lokis walk toward Alioth, and Loki figures that they get inside it and do it in. The USS Eldridge crashes down in front of them, and Alioth goes for it. Loki figures that they can sneak around Alioth while it's occupied with the ""big meal"". Alioth destroys the ship and its crew with its touch, and Loki, watching, figures they'd better think about their plan.

The truck approaches them, and Mobius parks it and Sylvie gets out and approaches the Lokis. Loki runs over to Mobius and Sylvie and asks what happened, and Loki introduces the other three Lokis. He says that they plan to kill Alioth, and Sylvie tells him that Alioth is protecting the only way out of the Void. She explains that she's going to enchant Alioth.

At the TVA, Ravonna visits the imprisoned B-15. B-15 asks why she's locked up, and Ravonna tells the Hunter that she was disloyal to the TVA. The prisoner insists that the people need to know the truth, and Ravonna insists that the TVA needs stability. Ravonna says that since B-15 had a link with Sylvia, B-15 needs to tell Ravonna what drives Sylvie. B-15 tells Ravonna that Sylvie will be searching for whoever created the fake Time Keepers, and figures that Ravonna wants to find whoever is behind the TVA's creation .The hunter says that Ravonna will never find the creator before Sylvie does, because Ravonna only wants it by Sylvie needs it.

Ravonna leaves and summons Miss Minutes to get her all the files on the founding of the TVA from the beginning of time. Miss Minutes agrees when Ravonna says that whoever created the TVA is in danger, and she needs to find them.

In the Void, the group stops in a ruin for shelter, and Mobius admits that he doesn't remember the TVA ever capturing Alligator. Mobius says that he's turning on the thing he devoted his life to, and Kid hopes that Loki and Sylvie know what they're doing.

Loki and Sylvie sit outside and Loki conjures a blanket to keep himself warm. He offers to conjure one for Sylvie, and they both agree that Mobius' theory about Sylvie's nexus event of the two of them becoming romantically involves is rubbish and another TVA lie. Sylvie admits that she doesn't have anyone close, but she has more important things like bringing down the TVA and saving the universe.

With a gesture, Loki conjures his blanket around Sylvie. She accepts it, and then thanks Loki. He tells her that it's his pleasure. Sylvie asks how she knows that Loki won't betray her, and Loki tells her that he betrayed everyone who ever loved him, and that's not who he is anymore. He tells Sylvie that he won't let her down, and Sylvie says that if the TVA is gone, there might be a timeline for Loki to rule. Loki says that then he'd finally be happy, and they both smile.

Loki asks Sylvie what she'll do when it's all over, and she admits that she doesn't know. He says that he doesn't know, either, and suggests that they figure it out together. Sylvie only says ""maybe"".

The five Lokis and Mobius seek out Alioth, and Sylvie says that Alioth knows where the creator of the TVA is. She thinks if she can get close enough to it, she can link to Alioth, and it will take her to whoever is responsible. Sylvie gives Loki the tempad she stole so that he can escape, and Loki says that he's staying and he's going with Sylvie. Loki gives the tempad to Mobius, and Classic and Kid tell Mobius that they're staying there in their home.

Kid gives Loki his flaming sword, and Classic wishes Loki luck. The three variant Lokis leave, and Mobius summons a portal. He tells Loki that he'll burn the TVA to the ground, and thanks Loki for the ""spark"". Loki hugs Mobius and thanks his friend, and then Mobius goes through the portal.

Loki and Sylvie approach Alioth, waiting for a branch. When one doesn't happen, Sylvie tells Loki that they'll have to create a distraction. Loki puts a hand on her shoulder, nods, and runs off swinging the sword to get Alioth's attention. As it moves toward him, Sylvie grabs a smoke tendril and tries to enchant the creature. Alioth continues moving toward Sylvie, and Loki yells at it to follow him

Classic returns and creates a projection of Asgard's buildings, drawing Alioth's attention. It consumes the building, and Classic uses all of his magic to maintain it as long as he can. Loki joins Sylvie and figures that they're stronger than they realize. Sylvie and Loki join hands and enchant Alioth, which consumes Asgard, and then the weakened Classic as he yells ""Glorious purpose!"" and laughs triumphantly.

Alioth turns to Loki and Sylvie, and they manage to disperse it and create a gate out of the Void. They then walk through... together."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10161342/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,The clock is ticking in the season finale which finds Loki and Sylvie on a date with destiny.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Kate Herron'],"['', '', '']",[],"['kang the conqueror character', 'end of time', 'miss minutes character']",[],"Loki and Sylvie stand at a castle on a planetoid, beyond the Void. They approach the main doors, and Sylvie asks Loki if he thinks it's a bad idea if she kicks them in. He says that he doesn't think that, and he asks if Sylvie is okay when she hesitates. Sylvie tells him that she needs a moment, and says that she's been waiting for the moment her entire life and just needs a minute to get her head straight.

The doors open and Loki and Sylvie go in. There is a vast hallway, and as they start to go down it, Miss Minutes appears before them. She welcomes them to the Citadel at the End of Time, and says that He Who Remains is impressed. The AI explains that He created all and controls all... at the end of time. He wants to offer Loki and Sylvie a deal, and has worked it out so he can insert them back into the timeline in a way that won't disrupt things. Miss Minutes says that the TVA can keep doing its vital work, and Loki and Sylvie can live the lives they always wanted.

Loki will be allowed to win against the Avengers, kill Thanos, and gain the Infinity Gauntlet and Asgard. Sylvie will have a lifetime of happy memories and the two Lokis together. Miss Manners assures them that He can make it work and they can have it all together. Sylvie says that it's a fiction, and Loki insists that they write their own destinies. Miss Manners wishes them good luck and disappears, and Loki and Sylvie continue on.

At the TVA, Ravonna is in her office collecting her files. Miss Manners appears and says that she's downloading the files Ravonna needs. Ravonna confirms that the files aren't what she asked for, and Miss Manners says that He thinks the files Ravonna got will be more useful. With that, the AI disappears.

Loki and Sylvie reach a chamber covered in dust, and a door opposite where they came in opens and reveals He. He's amused and impressed that there are two Lokis there, and says that the name Miss Manners gave him is creepy but he likes it. They take the elevator up to He's office, and He assures them that he's flesh and blood. Sylvie swings at He with her sword, and he disappears before she can hit him. He reappears and then disappears, chuckling, before Sylvie can hit him.

The elevator arrives at He's office, and the Lokis find He waiting for them. He pours coffee and invites them to take a seat, and they hesitantly sit down.

Mobius enters Ravonna's office, and she figures that if anyone could make it back from the Void, it would be Mobius. She says that the pruned Mobius because she couldn't let him get in the way of their mission, and says that it can't be for nothing. Ravonna calls in a Hunter, and Mobius tells her that it won't work now that they know her secret. Mobius' former friend wonders what he's done.

In Fremont, Ohio, 2018, Hunters pursue B-15 through a school. B-15 goes into an office and a Hunter corners her. She tells him that he has to listen to her, but he refuses. The principal whose office it is comes in and wonders what's going on. She looks just like Ravonna, and B-15 tells the Hunter that the principal isn't Ravonna, and they have a lot to talk about.

Loki tells He that he's lost, and Sylvie comes at He. He teleports out of reach of Sylvie, and takes out a script of what they've said and done, and will do. After assuring them that he knows they don't kill him and He has programmed his tempad with that knowledge, He says that he knows everything they've done, and that he ""paved the road"" so that they would get where they are.

He shows them more pages, saying that there's only one way it can go. When Sylvie wonders why they're there, He says that it's about the journey. Loki figures that it's a manipulation, and He finds it interesting that Loki would consider it manipulation. He asks Sylvie if she trusts Loki, or thinks she can trust anyone at all.

Ravonna insists to Mobius that the TVA is a necessary lie, and she believes whoever created the TVA had a reason. She insists that they have to prune the timeline to prevent chaos, and that only the person in charge has free will. Mobius accuses Ravonna of betraying him, and Ravonna tells him that he betrayed her. He turned to the Variants, throwing away their friendships. Ravonna creates a portal and says she's doing what she has to. Mobius turns on his pruning rod, and Ravonna tells him that he's no danger to her. He stabs at her, and Ravonna blocks his blow, disarms him, and kicks him to the floor.

Mobius tells Ravonna to prune him. She deactivates the rod instead, grabs her bag, tells Mobius she's going to go in search of free will, and leaves through the portal.

He admits that his methods are deceptive, but without the TVA, everything burns. Loki asks what He is afraid of, and he says that he's afraid of himself. Sylvie wonders who He is, and He tells them that it's not as simple as a name. He explains that a Variant of himself once lived on the 31st century, and he discovered that there were other versions. Other He's learned the same thing, made contact, and for a while there was peace as they shared technology and knowledge.

Some He's weren't so pure of heart, and became conquerors. Each Variant fought to preserve his universe and annihilate the others. The first Variant encountered a creature capable of consuming time and space: Alioth. He weaponized Alioth and ended the multiversal war, isolated their timeline, and prevented any other branches by creating the TVA.

He says that he keeps them safe, and if they want to see evil then they should meet his Variants. He tells them that something worse will replace him if they depose him, and the TVA is the only scenario that works. Sylvie suggests that He is a liar, and He tells them that if they kill him then they'll have to deal with an infinite number of Variants... or they run the place.

Loki wonders why He would give up being in control, and He says that he's tired and older than he looks. He says that the ""game"" is for the young and the hungry, and the persons best-suited to take his place are Loki and Sylvie. They can take over and return to the TVA as its benevolent rulers. Sylvie accuses him of treating people as pawns, and He says that it was practical, not personal. When she tells him that it was personal to her, He calls her a murderer and a hypocrite, and they're all villains.

He says that now they can do horrific things for a good reason. Thunder rumbles and the lights dim, and He says that they just crossed the threshold. He says that he doesn't know how everything is going to go, and they've reached the point where his knowledge of the future ends. Outside, the timeline starts branching.

Loki wonders if that's it, and wonders if He is going to let them decide his fate. He tells them that he is, and either they let him live or they kill him and another Variant of him takes his place. Sylvie thinks He is lying to them, and He says that it's no lie.

Sylvie lunges at He, and Loki stops her and says that they should talk about it. Loki pulls her back with his magic, and parries her blow when she swings at him. Loki says that he's a liar, and doesn't think He is lying. Sylvie figures that Loki wants He's throne, and Loki wonders if they will unleash something worse by killing He. Loki insists that it's not about a throne, but Sylvie calls herself a fool for ever trusting Loki. Loki figures that Sylvie never trusted him, and what's going on is bigger than their experience.

When Sylvie wonders why they're seeing it the same way, Loki tells her that she can't trust and he can't be trusted. Loki wants to wait, and Sylvie attacks him with her sword and he defends himself. Sylvie tells Loki to kill her and take his throne, then kicks him when he refuses. They continue fighting, and Loki teleports in front of her blade and drops his own sword as she prepares to kill He.

Loki asks Sylvie to stop, and says that he feels what she feels and has been where she has been. All he knows is that he just wants Sylvie to be okay. Sylvie drops her sword and they kiss, and then Sylvie tells Loki that she's not him, opens a portal, and shoves Loki through it back to a theater in the TVA.

Sylvie closes the portal before Loki can come back through, and she asks He if he's going to beg for his life. He doesn't, and Sylvie runs him through the chest. He dies and nothing happens, and Sylvie collapses to the floor in exhaustion and despair. Outside, the timeline continues branching.

At the TVA, Mobius and B-15 monitor the branching timeline. They recite the TVA's oath.

Loki sits in the theater and mourns. He then gets up and goes out, and finds the Hunters mobilizing. Loki finds Mobius and B-15 discussing the branching, and Loki yells that they can't stop it. He explains what happened to Mobius, and different Variants of a dangerous person are coming. Mobius has no idea who Loki is because of the alterations in the timeline, and Loki looks at the statue of He that has replaced the statues of the Time Keepers."

Emma insists that she's a real person and no savior, but admits that she wanted him to have his best chance. Henry asks her to stay for one week to prove that he's not crazy, saying that his life sucks with Regina. Emma tells him that his life is nothing compared to hers, and her parents abandoned her on a freeway and her foster family had their own baby and sent her back when she was 3. Henry insists that she went through the wardrobe and appeared on the freeway, and her real parents tried to save her from the curse, but Emma doesn't believe him.

Snow White finds the Prince and pleads with him to come back to her. She kisses him but he doesn't awaken.

He insists he doesn't. She asks who he does think his mother is. Regina assures him Emma (Jennifer Morrison) is no longer an issue, but then hears the town clock time.

The Evil Queen teleports back to her castle as Prince Charming tries to kill her by throwing his sword. The Magic Mirror (Giancarlo Esposito) asks what she's done. The Evil Queen explains she casts the Dark Curse, much to the surprise of her servant and the Magic Mirror. She then goes to the Forbidden Fortress to see Maleficent (Kristin Bauer), another evil witch. Two briefly spar verbally. The Evil Queen then demands her curse back. Maleficent say they've already made their exchange. It's hers now. She points out it's hidden in the orb on her staff and contained for good reason, and asks where it came from. The Evil Queen summons her magical forces, summoning a fireball from the fireplace.

The mistress protects her pet, but the Evil Queen binds her with the metal from the chandelier and takes the staff. When Maleficent tells her to do her worst, the Evil Queen refuses, saying she's her only friend, and ignores her friend's warning. The Dark Curse will create a void within her she can't fill. The Evil Queen accepts that and leaves.

Later, the Evil Queen meets with the other dark forces of the land and tells them today is the day they will finally emerge triumphant. They ask if they'll be happy and the Evil Queen says they will, but she needs a lock of hair from the darkest souls of the land. At her gesture, the trees around them animate, surrounding them. They each contribute a lock and the Evil Queen causes the limbs to withdraw. She then takes out the final ingredient: the heart of her prized steed from her childhood. She unleashes the Dark Curse and a column of magical smoke swirls up into the air as the others look on, but then disappears. A gnome laughs at the Evil Queen for her failure. She transforms him into a stone statue. Regina is in the garden admiring the apples and a gnome statue when the newspaper editor, Sydney (the Magic Mirror), approaches her. He has already published an article in the town newspaper, the Mirror, about Emma destroying the town's boundary marker, but admits he's learned little of Emma's background.

Emma is at Granny's Diner getting breakfast when the waitress, Ruby (Meghan Ory), brings her a cup of hot chocolate. Emma assumes Sheriff Graham got it for her and goes over to him, telling him she doesn't want anything from him. Henry looks up from the next booth and says he sent it over. He invites her to walk him to school, and says his plan is to free everyone from the curse. As Emma is about to bite one of Regina's apples, Henry grabs it and throws it away. She asks why the citizens don't remember their past lives. Henry explains they all live in a haze. Emma is the only one who can free everyone. He removed the pages from the storybook to keep Regina from learning Emma is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Henry tells her to read the pages and learn about her past, but to make sure Regina doesn't see them because it would be bad if she learned who Emma is. They arrive at the school. Henry goes inside after saying that he's glad Emma believes him. His teacher, Mary Margaret, sees them talk and comes over to thank Emma for making Henry smile. She explains to Emma that Regina has managed to remain mayor through intimidation. Henry thinks she's Snow White. When Mary Margaret asks who Henry thinks Emma is, Emma lies and she says she's not in the book. Emma goes to see Archie (Raphael Sbarge) and asks why Henry thinks people are storybook characters. Archie explains Henry is using the book to deal with his problems. Emma points out Henry only got the book a month ago and his problems go back further.

Meanwhile, a thief reaches into the coach, steals a package of jewels, and rides off. Prince Charming goes after the thief, knocks the person off their horse, and discovers that it's a woman.

Clearly pleased that Emma stayed for Henry Mills' sake, Mary Margaret offers to let Emma stay with her, but Emma warns that she's not the roommate type.

The next day, Mary Margaret is volunteering at the hospital and notices Henry sitting with John Doe . He asks what's wrong with the patient and Mary Margaret explains that he's been there as long as she's been volunteering, and no one knows who he is or what family he has. Henry asks if she's sure she doesn't know who he is, and Mary Margaret says that she doesn't. Henry meets with Emma and tells her that she's found her father, Prince James Charming, and that he's the John Doe patient. He shows Emma the storybook and points out that Prince Charming and John Doe have the same scar on the cheek. Henry believes that the curse is keeping John Doe and Mary Margaret apart by keeping him in a coma. Emma doesn't believe it but Henry insists that they have to remind them by having Mary Margaret read the story to the coma patient. Emma agrees but says that she'll ask her. Emma then talks to Mary Margaret and suggests that she play along with Henry's idea so that he'll realize that he's wrong on his own when nothing happens.

Disgusted, Snow White says that it must be a marriage of convenience because no one marries for true love, and Prince Charming defends it as a necessary merger. When Snow White refuses, Prince James Charming threatens to turn her over to the Evil Queen, who has sentenced her to death for murder and treason. Snow White agrees and Prince Charming releases her.

When they get to the hospital, Sheriff Graham is there and informs them that the patient has gone missing. Regina is there, looking into the matter as well, and demands to know why Emma is there. She realizes that Henry lied to her when he said he was going to the arcade.

Regina explains that she's the patient's emergency contact, after found him by the road years ago and brought him to the hospital. Emma offers to help find him, but Regina tells her to stay out of it and walks away with Henry.

Graham begins organizing the search and talks to the two employees, Leroy and Walter. They check the security tapes and Emma realizes it's the wrong tape. When they find the right one, they confirm that, four hours ago, John Doe walked out on his own into the nearby woods.

Snow White leads Prince James Charming through the woods to where she sold the jewels, and he notices her holding a necklace. She tells him not to worry about it but he snatches it away. He realizes that it's filled with dust, and she explains that it contains fairy dust that can transform an adversary into a harmless form. Prince Charming figures that she plans to use it on the Evil Queen and points out that Snow White has a lot of anger. The thief explains that the charges against her are false and that she only lived because the Queen sent the Huntsman to rip out her heart, but he took pity on her and let her go. Snow White tells Prince Charming that she only wants to get enough money to leave for another realm, and she thought the coach belonged to the Queen.

However, the Evil Queen's Black Knight finds her and close in, and Snow White realizes that Prince Charming still has her necklace.

Henry sneaks away from his mother and comes to find them, and tells Mary Margaret that John Doe is looking for her.

The lead Black Knight prepares to kill Snow White when Prince Charming arrives and kills him with an arrow. He takes on the second knight while the third one snatches up Snow White and rides away. Prince Charming grabs an arrow and manages to shoot the knight, killing him, and Snow White rides back. She points out that he saved him and Prince James Charming says that it was the honorable thing to do. He reminds her that they need to get is jewels, and Snow White says that the trolls she sold it to are just over the next rise.

Mary Margaret doesn't believe Henry, who insists that she needs to stop and let John Doe catch up to her. Emma tells him to go home, but as Henry argues, Graham calls them over. He's found John Doe's patient tag with blood on it.

Prince Charming and Snow White arrive at the Troll Bridge and proceed on foot. The trolls climb up over the edge to surround them, and Snow White tries to negotiate for the ring. They suspect it's a setup and attack, and the lead troll has his men search Prince Charming. They find Snow White's necklace and toss it to the ground, and then find the poster for Snow White and realize who she is. Prince Charming grabs his sword and drives them back, and Snow White grabs her necklace and runs. However, the trolls grab Prince Charming and prepare to kill him. Snow White returns and uses the fairy dust to transform the trolls into insects, saving the prince but using all of the dust. He thanks her, to which she retorts with his words, that it was the honorable thing to do. They continue on with the jewels.

The group follows the trail to the old toll bridge and finds John Doe lying in the stream. They pull him out and Mary Margaret begs him to come back to them, and to her. She administers CPR and he finally revives. Looking up, he says that she saved her, while an astonished Emma looks on. John Doe admits that he doesn't know who he is, and Mary Margaret tells him that he'll be okay. They take him to the hospital and Dr. Whale works on him. A woman runs in, calling the patient ""David"", and Dr. Whale ushers her back. Regina arrives to confirm that the woman is Kathryn Nolan, the man's wife.

Prince Charming gives Snow White the gold back, and she gives him the ring. He comments that it's not her style and she tries it on. He stares at her for a moment, and then Snow White says that it isn't her style and hands it back. Prince Charming offers her the rest of the jewels, but she says that she has what she needs. He wishes her well, and says that if she needs anything... and Snow White finishes the sentiment: ""he'll always find her"". They say their goodbyes and go their separate ways. Snow White turns and looks back, hesitating for a moment, and then continuing on.

Kathryn comes over to Mary Margaret, Emma, and Henry in the hospital, thanking them for their help. She explains she and her husband were having marital problems, so she told him to leave if he didn't want to be married to her. When he left, she assumed that he left town and didn't know he'd been injured. Now Kathryn has a second chance, to say she's sorry. Dr. Whale tells everyone present that David is physically okay, but he has no memory of his past life. Dr Whale suggests that David's first instinct was to find something familiar, and Henry says he was looking for someone. As Kathryn goes to her husband, Henry goes to get his backpack and whispers to Mary Margaret that David was going to the bridge and really was looking for her, that they belong together. As Regina leaves with Henry, Emma catches up to her and points out that Kathryn's story sounds fake. She points out how convenient it is that Regina just now found Kathryn, and Regina says that after Emma went over the tapes, they checked past tapes and found out that David mentioned Kathryn's name in his sleep from time to time. The mayor tells Emma that true love won out and that thanks to Emma and Mary Margaret, the couple will now be together forever. Regina says that not having someone is the worst curse imaginable and leaves. Mary Margaret watches as Kathryn and David embrace. He looks up at her and seems to recognize her, while Mary Margaret looks at the ring that she's wearing. Later, Mary Margaret is at home when Emma arrives at her doorstep and says she wants to take her up on her offer of a spare room."

Archie is at home when Emma storms in and demands to know what he did to Henry. He insists he made the right decision. Regina calls and asks Emma where Henry is. Henry says he has no idea. Archie realizes Henry went to the mine. At the mine, Henry enters the shaft.

-Rumpelstiltskin is spinning thread when Jiminy comes to see him with his collection of stolen goods. As Rumpelstiltskin gives him the gold thread in return, he asks Jiminy what else he wants. Jiminy admits he wants to be free to be someone else, but something keeps holding him back. Rumpelstiltskin asks if it's something or someone, and Jiminy admits his parents. The imp offers him a potion to put in their food, but points out Jiminy has nothing to pay him with. He tells Jiminy to leave his parents for him as payment for the potion. Jiminy wonders what will become of them. Rumpelstiltskin assures them they'll be in safe hands. After a moment, Jiminy takes the potion and departs.

Archie and Emma go to the mine and find one of Henry's discarded candy bars, and realize he's gone inside.Henry walks through the mine shaft and finds a piece of decorative glass in the wall. As he removes it, the ceiling starts to come down. Outside, Archie enters the mine shaft to rescue the boy and the entrance collapses behind him before Emma can go to help. Inside, Archie lights a match and calls out to Henry, and the boy runs up to him. The psychiatrist insists they need to get out but Henry runs into the tunnels, telling Archie to follow him. After a moment, Archie follows the boy into the mine.


Jiminy's parents force him to go to a home and convince the owners, Stephen and Donna, to let them in as weary travelers. They tell the couple there is plague in the next town and they have an elf potion. They sell it to the desperate couple for everything they have and leave. Jiminy gives them the bottle and goes with his parents, but objects to stealing from them. His parents insist it's okay, but Jiminy has enough and throws the contents of Rumpelstiltskin's bottle at them. However, the Puppet Prince says he switched bottles, and they gave the potion to the couple.


Jiminy runs into the house and finds the couple has been transformed into puppets, holding hands. His parents come in and chuckle at their success, and then the couple's boy, the one from the fair, comes in. He stares at his transformed parents in horror and demands to know what Jiminy did to them.

Archie finds Henry deep within the mine, shining his light down a shaft. The psychiatrist says they have to get out. Henry accuses him of thinking he's insane. Archie warns they're trapped with no way out.


Outside, the townspeople gather to try and remove the debris from the mine shaft. When another quake shifts the area, Regina tells them to stop. Emma says Henry went into the mine because of her. Archie's dog Pongo barks. Inside, Archie and Henry hear it and follow the voice. Meanwhile, Emma tells Regina they have to stop arguing and work together to save Henry. Regina asks her to help. Marco suggests explosives to punch an opening.

Inside, Archie and Henry find an old mine elevator. They start cranking it upward. Meanwhile, the fireman plants the explosives. Emma tells them to detonate. The charges goes off, jarring the elevator loose and causing it to drop several dozen feet downward before stopping. Meanwhile, Emma runs to the entrance but discovers they failed.

At the hospital, Mary Margaret is leaving for the day when Dave approaches her. He explains he's starting his physical therapy and has been told to walk outside with an escort. Dave hints he could use a volunteer. Mary Margaret agrees. Outside, Dave tries to remember the town and explains he woke up in some strange land. He admits he lied about remembering the dog to protect Kathryn's feelings. Mary Margaret says he must feel lonely. Dave says she's the only thing in the world that feels right to him.

Kathryn comes up behind them and offers him cranberry muffins, his favorite. Mary Margaret starts to leave. Dave asks if he'll see her tomorrow. After a moment, Mary Margaret walks away without a word.

Regina snaps at the rescue teams. Emma calms her down. Marco suggests they can drill down if they know where Archie and Henry are. Emma releases Pongo, who goes to a spot on the ground and starts digging. They remove a metal plate to reveal an air shaft.

In the elevator, Henry apologizes to Archie. The psychiatrist says it's okay. He assures the boy he doesn't think he's crazy, but explains Regina has a clear idea of what she wants for Henry and is scared when her son deviates from it. Archie says it's also okay for Henry to be free to think what he wants, and apologizes for what he said. When Henry asks why he said what he did, Archie admits he's not the man he wants to be. The elevator shifts again as it starts to give out.

Marco and the others remove the grille. Regina wonders what to do next.

Henry tells Archie he can be Jiminy Cricket, and the cricket was once a guy who took a long time to figure out the right thing to do. Archie admits it sounds like him. Henry says it's harder due to the curse for Archie to hear the voice inside of him and be who he wants to be.

Emma volunteers to take the line down so it won't hit the sides of the shaft and set off another collapse. When Regina tries to do it herself, Emma warns the mayor isn't physically up to the challenge. After a moment, Regina agrees and asks Emma to bring her son safely back to her.

As they wait, Archie asks Henry again why it's so important to him he's right. Henry explains there must be more than the everyday world, but never found any proof. Archie says he does remember the person he wants to be, and he just needs to listen harder. They hear Emma come down the shaft and drop onto the elevator. Archie hands Henry up to her. The elevator finally gives way, plummeting down the shaft... but Archie catches a hook with his umbrella, saving himself.

The three of them climb both out. Regina immediately embraces Henry and tells Emma to clear away the crowd. The mayor goes to thank Archie. He tells he he's going to treat Henry the way he wants to. Regina warns him things haven't changed. Archie tells her he'll always do his best. If she doesn't let him do what he needs to, he threatens to testify against her in any future custody battle.

-Jiminy stands outside of his parents' wagon, looks up at the stars, and makes a wish. The Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) flies up and warns him she can't bring back the boy's parents. However, she says he can help the couple's boy, and asks who he would want to be if he could get away from his parents. Jiminy listens to the crickets and silently makes his wish. The Blue Fairy grants it, transforming him into a cricket. Jiminy says that he's free. She tells him to find the boy, Gepetto.

-Emma watches Archie and Marco talk. Henry says they're old friends. As they talk, Henry points out they can hear the crickets now. Things are changing. At his shop, Mr. Gold walks past the puppets of Donna and Stephen. Mary Margaret returns to the hospital and delivers her letter of resignation. At the mine, Regina drops a piece of glass down the shaft to join the many other pieces she has dropped there, revealing they are the shards of Snow White's glass coffin."

She comments about an old windmill on the front lawn that he disliked very much. Everyone is waiting inside for him (a surprise Welcome Home party). As David works through the crowd of guests, he does not remember anyone except for people he met after he woke up from his coma. Nolan's doctor, Dr. Whale, is also at the party. Henry tells Emma that the reason David (John Doe) does not remember anything is because the curse is not working on him yet. His 'false' memories has not set in yet. Henry tells Emma they have to jog Davids memory so he remembers he is Prince Charming. David comes over and Henry asks him if he ever used a sword, which he laughs about. Alone in the kitchen, Davids wife Kathryn, is upset because she feels like she still does not have her husband back. She confides in Regina about the matter. Regina tells her she shares a similar experience of losing a lover, who is now dead. Regina mentions that Kathryn is lucky that David is still alive, as they will have another chance to reconcile - Regina tells her to go to back to her husband at the party. As Kathryn goes back to the party and looks for David, he has already left.

Meanwhile David walks over to Mary Margarets house and asks her why she did not come back to the hospital (as a volunteer), and if he was the reason she resigned from the hospital. Mary Margaret tells him he is married. David tells her he is choosing her, and not his wife Kathryn.

Back in the fairytale Prince Charming (James) is fighting a brute and he wins, supposedly killing his enemy. His father (King George) and the rest of the court who were watching him all congratulate him. Prince James' father makes a deal with King Midas for gold and other riches, if Prince James can kill the dragon that terrorizes his village. As Prince Charming stands and speaks of plans to slay the dragon, the brute who he thought he had killed, drives a lance through Prince Charming's back and out his chest.

The dead Prince James is taken away as his father says goodbye. The knights tell King George they must move fast to kill the dragon, or else Midas will find another dragon slayer. In turn, the King would lose what Midas promised to him (gold, prosperity) in exchange for slaying the dragon. The King tells the knights he already called for help. Rumpelstiltskin shows up and says ""nice way to treat a gift I gave to you"" (refering to the dead Prince James). It is revealed that Rumpelstiltskin found the child (Prince James) for the King because he and his wife could not have children. The King wants another deal, he tells Rumpelstiltskin he will give him anything if he brings his son back to kill the dragon ailing Midas. In return, Rumpelstiltskin tells the King he wants the magic wand owned by the Fairy God Mother (who often helps out the King), demanding her whereabouts. The King agrees, but Rumpelstiltskin tells the King the dead can not be resurrected and the King is upset because they had an agreement to have Prince James to slay the dragon. Rumpelstiltskin reveals to the King that Prince James has a twin brother, and will have him slay the dragon in place of the dead Prince James.

Back in Storybrooke Mary Margaret is washing the dishes and talking to Emma. She is too focused on what David said about choosing her, and not his wife, Kathryn. Emma tells her to stop cleaning and have a drink. Emma tells Mary Margaret if she thinks doing something is wrong (being with a married man), then it is. She tells Mary Margaret to let David figure out his life.

David is looking through his pictures and Kathryn tells him he looks different, that he always use to have a buzz cut. His wife tries to convince him to go to bed. David asks her if they can sit and talk some more. They share a kiss but David pulls her away and tells her it is not right.

Going back to the fairytale, the slain Prince James' twin brother (the Shepherd) is chasing a goat as his mother returns from the market. His mother tells him she had an interesting talk with the grain merchant. He has a daughter that would make a good match because she has a big dowry and it will save their farm. He insists that true love is the one thing he can not afford to sacrifice, and that when he chooses to marry, it would be for love. Rumpelstiltskin shows up and his mother tells him she gave his twin brother to Rumpelstiltskin (for King George) in order to save the farm. He asks Rumpel what he wants, and he tells him that the King needs someone to slay a dragon. He tells Rumpel he is not a dragon slayer. Rumpel tells him if he succeeds in slaying the dragon, his mother shall never want for another thing in her life, and he will be the conquering hero.

Mary Margaret is at the restaurant and the Doctor shows up and asks if she quit the volunteer position at the hospital because of him (refering to their less-than-spectuacluar date). The Doctor leaves just as Regina shows up to talk to Mary Margaret about David. She tells Mary Margaret that David and her do not belong together. Regina tells Mary Margaret, David left his wife and she should stay away because he is fragile and Mary Margaret is close to destroying many lives.

In the fairytale, King Midas comes up to Prince James (who is now the twin) and tells him if he kills the dragon he will be a legend. Prince James is nervous because he does not know how to fight with a sword, or being a knight - let alone slaying a dragon. The Knights tell him to stay out of the cave as they will take care of killing the dragon. Even though Prince James may not literally slay the dragon himself, as long as Midas sees the head of the slain dragon will be sufficient to save the kingdom.

As Prince James and the Knights walk to the dragons lair high up the mountains, they pass many burning bones and ashes of past dragon slayers who were unsuccessful. Although Prince Charming is supposed to stay out of the caves (need him to be alive), he couldn't stand around having several knights dying and to not help them in slaying the dragon. He runs towards the dragons lair as the dragon flies around and spits fire. James manages to save the Head Knight out of the cave and drags him to safety behind a stone. The dragon spots Prince James and starts going after him. He grabs a sword, runs to entrap the dragon's neck in a narrow cave, and chops its head off with the golden sword.

David shows up at Mary Margarets classroom and she is upset that he left his wife. He tells Mary Margaret his wife Kathryn needs someone to feel for her like he feels for Mary Margaret. David tells her he wants her. He asks Mary Margaret to meet him at the toll bridge, where she found him, at 8 p.m. The scene cuts to the station where the Sheriff brings Emma donuts and asks her to work that night for him. He volunteers at an animal shelter and needs to feed the dogs for the shelter's supervisor who is sick.

Mary Margaret shows up at the station and tells Emma that David left his wife Kathryn. She tells Emma he wants to meet her that night. She asks Emma what to do and Emma tells her to go and meet him because David has made a choice.

The King tells King Midas that his son has slayed the dragon. Midas tells the Prince they respect him because of what he did. Midas tells them he does not think small, as he thinks big and then they bring in a girl who Midas introduces as his daughter, Abigail. He tells them he values her more than gold and he wants to offer her hand in marriage to the Prince. The one who slays the dragon also means he is worthy to marry Midas' daughter and unite kingdoms. Prince James is humbled but begins to decline the offer, his 'father' grabs him aside and tells him he must marry her. If he chooses not to, he will be responsible for the destruction of everyone and everything in their kingdom. The King will also kill him and his mother.

At around 7:45 p.m., David he sets out to find the toll bridge with a map in his hands. On the way, he encounters Regina. She asks him if he is lost and he tells her he is looking for the toll bridge. When Regina asks why he is looking for the bridge, he tells her he is looking for someone. She realizes who he is looking for and says So you made your choice. He tells her he cannot change his feelings. Regina gives him instructions to the toll bridge and wishes him luck.

Meanwhile Mary Margaret is waiting at the toll bridge for David. David is lost Regina actually gave him false directions to the bridge. Regina's directions takes David to Mr. Gold's pawn shop. He goes into Mr. Golds shop and asks him where the toll bridge is. Mr. Gold gives him the correct directions and on David's way out, he sees a windmill and he asks Mr. Gold where he got it. Mr. Gold replies that it has been gathering dust forever. David tells him the windmill used to belong to him, and that he remembers everything. Mr. Gold = Rumpel grins as David makes his way out

Prince James comes back to his mother who is happy he is alive. She is excited about how good he looks and how he looks like a Prince. She tells James the King is taking care of them and has made improvements to their house. He tells his mother that Midas wants to unite the Kingdoms and wants him to marry his daughter. His mother says he was right to refuse the offer, assuming he turned down down Midas' offer, as he did to the grain merchant's daughter. But in order to save the whole kingdom, he must take his place as his dead brother James, and marry Midas' daughter Abigail. He tells her no one can truly know his identity as James. He also tells her given his new identity as Prince James, he never see her again. He came to say goodbye.

His mother gives him her ring from his father she says the ring follows true love wherever it goes - and they embrace and say goodbye.

David finally shows up at the toll bridge and Mary Margaret is waiting wearing the same ring exactly like the one in the fairy tale from James' mom but David tells her he remembers everything. Mary Margaret asks if he loves his wife, and he says he does not know although he knows he did, and he has to honor it. He tells her he has intense feelings for Mary Margaret, but he is going back to his wife because it is the right thing to do. Mary Margaret is hurt and upset, and tells David the right thing to do was to not lead her on. She leaves the bridge hurriedly in disappointment and tears.

Patrolling the streets on the night shift, Emma is driving in the deputy car and she sees a dark figure escaping from the 2nd story window of the Mayor's house. She hits and stops the dark figure walking out the drive way with a baton that is revealed to be Sheriff Graham. Emma questions what type of ""volunteering"" that Graham does, as she finds out that Regina and the Sheriff are sleeping together. The Sheriff tells her he snuck out of the window because Regina does not want Henry to know they are sleeping together.

David rings the doorbell and his wife Kathryn (who is Abigail, Midas daughter) answers the door and he tells her that he remembers everything. He tells her they were not at a good place when he got hurt, he needed time, and he has had time he remembers the windmill (he hated) that triggered his memory in Mr. Golds shop. He tells her they have work to do, it will take time, but he wants to see what happens.

Prince James and Midas daughter Abigail are getting married. Prince James' father King George tells him he is confident he has made the right decision. King George calls James son and James calls him father. Abigail does not look pleased with Prince James, and Prince George (Prince James' father) tells him to smile he is on the route to true love. Prince James and Abigail are in the carriage driving as Snow White is hiding in the trees (bring us to the plot of ""Snow Falls"")."

Graham does as Emma arrives. She deliberately avoids Graham, who throws a dart in front of her to stop her as she goes out the door. He asks why she's been avoiding him, and Emma says that she has no interest in discussing his affair with the mayor. Emma walks away but Graham follows her and says that he needs to make her understand. She wonders why, and Graham says that he doesn't feel anything for Regina. However, he didn't want Emma to look at him the way she is now. When she wonders why he cares, Graham leans forward and kisses her. He gets a brief flash of a forest, a wolf, Mary Margaret, and a vault with a black symbol on the door, and then Emma shoves him back. He says that he needs to feel something, but Emma tells him that whatever he wants, he won't get it with her.

Graham goes to Regina's house. When she answers the door, he confirms that her son is asleep, grabs her, and kisses her. The Evil Queen is at her palace and goes to the mausoleum where Snow is saying goodbye to her father. She offers her condolences and says that she also loved her husband, Snow's father. The Evil Queen promises to be there for Snow forever and hugs her.

Later, the Magic Mirror contacts the Evil Queen and congratulates her on the success of her revenge. The Evil Queen is happy that she has fooled Snow, but warns that the kingdom would turn on her if she took a more blatant revenge against Snow. She tells the Mirror that they must be delicate and carefully conceal any involvement in her murder. The Evil Queen wants someone with no heart to handle the killing, and the Mirror suggests that she use a Huntsman.

In the woods, the Huntsman brings down a deer and then thanks it for its sacrifice. He sheds a tear and then looks up as a wolf appears out of the woods. It steps forward and growls at the Huntsman, and the Huntsman says that it won't go hungry.

Graham wakes up from his dream, and tells Regina that he saw himself hunting a deer and talking with a wolf. He explains that he's seen the wolf before, but Regina says that it's a dream and tells him to go back to bed. Graham insists that it was a memory, not a dream, and goes out to get some air. He leaves despite her protests and goes to get his car at the bar. The wolf walks up to him and looks at him for a moment, and then trots away.

The next day, Emma enters the kitchen and finds a bouquet of flowers on the table. She assumes that they're Graham's and throws them away, but Mary Margaret comes in and says that Dr. Whale sent them after their one-night stand. Emma wonders if it's serious and Mary Margaret admits that she felt guilty about it. When Emma says that it's okay and that she never gets beyond one-nighters, Mary Margaret points out that she always keeps walls up from other people and figures that she has feelings for Graham. Emma denies it, proving Mary Margaret's point, and the teacher says that the wall will not only keep out pain but love. She then takes the flowers out of the garbage and puts them in a vase.

Graham runs into the woods and finds Gold out for what he says is a bit of gardening. When Graham says that he was looking for a wolf, Gold says that there aren't any wolves in Storybrooke. The sheriff explains that he saw the same wolf in his dream and then in the real world, and asks if Gold has seen it. Gold says that he hasn't but notes that some people believe that dreams are memories of another life. When Graham asks what he believes, Gold says that he never rules out anything and wishes Graham luck in finding what he's looking for. The Huntsman goes to a tavern with his wolf companion and the other patrons stare cautiously at the animal. They gossip that the Huntsman is an animal who was raised by animals and cries over his kills. One man comes over and asks him why he cries, and the Huntsman says that an honorable man cries, and that animals are pure of heart, not selfish and self-serving. The wolf growls at the man, who prepares to attack it. The Huntsman kills him and takes on the others, who withdraw after a few seconds. Meanwhile, the Evil Queen watches him through a shard of glass, decides that he's perfect, and tells her men to bring the Huntsman to her. In the woods, Graham continues to chase the wolf and catches a glimpse of it. He finally catches up to it and asks what it wants. It starts to walk away, but when he whistles to it, it turns around and comes to him. Graham pets it and has a flash of himself, killing a woman who looks like Mary Margaret. Graham goes to the school and finds Mary Margaret. He says that he thinks they know each other from another life.

The Huntsman enters the palace and refuses to give his real name to the Evil Queen. He explains that the wolves raised him and that his parents only gave birth to him, and she believes that he is a wolf rather than a sheep. She asks him to kill someone and the Huntsman wonders why he should. The Evil Queen offers him a place at her court as her Royal Huntsman, awash in luxury, and explains that she needs someone without compassion, someone who can carve a heart out and bringing it back to her. The Huntsman says that he can do that and tells the Evil Queen to outlaw the hunting of wolves in return. She promptly agrees and the Huntsman asks her who he is to kill.

Graham asks Mary Margaret if she remembers when they met, and she admits that she has no idea. He doesn't remember either, and explains that he doesn't remember meeting anyone in town. Mary Margaret dismisses it as life, and he asks if he's ever hurt her. Graham asks if she believes in past lives, and Mary Margaret tells him about Henry's theory that they're fairy tale characters. She tells him to go home and get some rest, and Graham hesitantly leaves.

The Huntsman, dressed as a guard in the Queen's army, walks Snow home. She offers him an apple and he refuses, and Snow realizes that he's not one of her father's knights. However, she realizes that he's there to kill him. He freely admits that he is, and Snow knocks him down in his armor and runs off. Emma is at the sheriff's office when Regina arrives. The mayor freely admits that she has a relationship with Graham, and asks what Emma's relationship is with Graham. Emma says that her life is her business, but Regina tells him to stay away from Graham because she's putting thoughts in his head and leading him on a path of self-destruction.Graham goes to see Henry and asks him if he's in his fairy tale book. The Huntsman finally catches up to Snow, who is sitting and writing a letter. He asks why and Snow says that she knows he'll find her no matter what. She asks the Huntsman to give her letter to the Evil Queen and tell her that she means every word. The Huntsman reads it, crying, and then draws his knife and advances on Snow. He uses it to cut a reed, carves it into a whistle, and tells her to use it to summon help. He then tells her to run while looking at a nearby deer.

Henry shows Graham the story of the Huntsman and asks when he started having memory flashes. When Graham says that it happened after he kissed Emma, the boy realizes that Graham is the Huntsman and the wolf is his guide. The memories began because the Huntsman spared Snow, Emma's mother. When Graham wondered what happened to the Huntsman in the story, Henry explains that the Evil Queen ripped his heart out so he would never feel anything again. He shows Graham a picture of the vault where she hid the Huntsman's heart, and Graham realizes what he needs to do.

As Graham leaves the house, he finds Emma waiting for him outside. She wonders what is going on and Graham explains that he needs to find the wolf to lead him to the vault where his heart is hidden. Emma wonders what he's talking about and Graham says that he doesn't feel anything. She offers to prove that he has a heart and touches his chest. Emma assures him that it's beating and then puts his heart to his chest as well. Graham doesn't believe it, insisting that it's the curse. The wolf appears down the street and they both follow it as it runs to a nearby cemetery. It leads them to a vault with the symbol from Graham's dream, and he realizes that his heart is inside. Graham approaches the vault and Emma tries to stop him, but realizes that he won't be deterred. She agrees to go with him and kicks open the vault door.

A knight brings the Huntsman to the Evil Queen. She asks if Snow is dead and the Huntsman says that he has her heart. However, first he shows her Snow's letter. The Evil Queen tells him to read it, and the Huntsman recites how Snow said that she knew her stepmother would never have love because of her. She hopes that with her death, the Evil Queen will rule her subjects well and that her need for revenge will be satisfied. Angry, the evil Queen throws the letter in the fire and asks if the Huntsman is becoming a sheep rather than a wolf. When he asks what Snow did, the Evil Queen says that she shared a secret with Snow but she didn't keep it, and the betrayal cost her dearly. The Huntsman then gives her the pouch with the heart. The Evil Queen places it into a box and closes it, and then prepares to put it in a rack with other boxes. When the rack doesn't open, the Evil Queen realizes that it isn't Snow's heart.Graham and Emma find a coffin and urns, but no sign of his heart. He searches for it without success but Emma says that it's okay. Regina arrives and demands to know what they're doing. She explains that the vault is her father's grave, and Graham says that he brought Emma there. He refuses to tell Regina why he was there and she offers to take him home, but Graham says that she doesn't want to go home with her. Regina realizes that he's willing to go with Emma, but Graham insists that it has nothing to do with Emma. He figures that he can't feel anything because of Regina, and he's rather have nothing than what they have. Regina tries to go to him, but Graham says that it's over. The mayor blames Emma, who says that the problem is with Regina, not her. She points out that both Henry and Graham are miserable and tells Regina to think about why people are running away from her. Regina punches her and Emma fights back. Graham separates them and Emma walks away, saying Regina isn't worth it. Regina turns to Graham, who walks away without a word.

Emma and Graham go back to the sheriff's office and he tends to her wounds. He apologizes for going out of his mind, but she understands and figures that he's heartbroken. Emma figures that Graham became involved with Regina because he was lonely and desperate. Regina goes into the vault and closes the door, and then puts the flowers on Henry's tomb. She then pushes it aside, revealing a secret stairway below. The Evil Queen seals the door and tells the Huntsman that he isn't going anywhere. She then takes his heart in punishment, pulling it out of his chest. The Evil Queen then kisses him and says that he's now her, and puts his heart into the rack. She warns the Huntsman that if he ever disobeys her, she'll squeeze. Demonstrating, the Evil Queen causes the Huntsman to collapse to the ground in agony. As her guards take him away to her bed chamber, the Evil Queen says that he is now hers forever.

Regina goes to the rack of boxes and removes the Huntsman's heart from its case. Graham finishes tending Emma's cuts and notices her smiling at him. She steps forward and kisses him, and Graham remembers everything from his life as the Huntsman. In the vault, Regina holds Graham's heart in her hand. Graham tells Emma that he remembers everything. Crying, he thanks Emma and starts to kiss her... and then collapses, dead, as Regina crushes his heart to dust."

""The Dark One,"" a man on a horse in the distance, subdues a couple of villagers who try to jump to the girl's defense by casting some kind of spell of them. Rumplestiltskin's son Baelfire (Dylan Schmid) worries he'll be taken next.

Back in Storybrooke, Emma (Jennifer Morrison) pays a visit to Mr. Gold after he called the Sheriff's Department. He wants to express his condolences about Sheriff Graham. He tells Emma after two weeks as acting sheriff, she'll have to wear the real badge. Mr. Gold offers Emma a keepsake from Graham's apartment. He insists she take a look through his things before they go to the trash. She accepts a pair of walkie-talkies. Mr. Gold tells her she can play with her boy, Henry (Jared Gilmore), and advises her time with her child is precious. ""That's the thing about children,"" he says. ""Before you know it, you lose them.""

Henry tells Emma they should stop messing with the curse for a while, given what happened to Graham. He says ""good always loses, because good has to play fair -- evil doesn't. She's evil,"" he adds, referring to Regina. ""You don't want to upset her anymore.""

Back at the office, Emma is about to clip on the real sheriff's badge but Regina (Lana Parrilla) stops her. She says she's going to appoint Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) from the newspaper (Fairy Tale Land's magic mirror) as sheriff. Emma tells Regina that Graham freed the sheriff's office from her leash, and she's ""not getting it back."" Regina fires Emma.

Emma is raging to loud music and drinking when Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) gets home. She's upset about losing her job, and says she doesn't know why. She just knows she wants it back. Mr. Gold drops in for a visit. He tells her ""two people with a common goal can accomplish many things; two people with a common enemy can accomplish even more."" He asks if she'd like a benefactor. He then tells her the town charter might mean the mayor is ""not quite as powerful as she seems.""

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Rumplestiltskin wakes his son in the middle of the night to hide away so he won't be taken for the war. They're caught by a group of nights. The knight explains to Rumple's son his father also ran from battle and all the other men were killed, ""and he returned home to a wife couldn't bear the sight of him."" The knight explains it's treason to avoid service, and calls for his men to take the boy. Rumple begs for leniency, and the knight forces him to kiss his boot in front of his own son. He does, and is kicked aside before the knights all leave. An old beggar manto whom Rumple had given alms (guest star Brad Dourif) comes along and tells Rumple that he'll find a way to be his benefactor.

Back in Storybrooke, Regina introduces Sidney Glass as the new sheriff. Emma interrupts and explains the town charter requires an election if there is another candidate for sheriff. Emma says she's running. Regina says Sidney is running, as well.

In Fairy Tale Land, the old man tells Rumple he needs to ""choose a different path."" Rumple says the only choice he has ""is which corner to hide in."" He says the only thing he's got is his boy, ""and they're going to take him away from me."" The man tells Rumple he should steal the dagger of ""The Dark One"" and keep him as a slave. Rumple says he'd be too terrified to do that. The man then suggests he simply take the power.

Regina visits Mr. Gold and they go back and forth about his fine-print reading of the charter. She says he's trifling with technicalities. Regina tells Mr. Gold he's backing a ""slow horse"" in this race, but he says she shouldn't underestimate ""someone who's acting for their child."" Regina says Henry is not Emma's child, ""not legally.""

""Now who's trifling with technicalities?"" Mr. Gold asks.

Emma finds Henry at the diner reading a newspaper. The headline -- from the story written by Sidney -- explains Emma gave birth to her son while she was in jail. Emma says those records are supposed to be sealed. Henry reminds her ""good can't beat evil."" When Emma mentions Mr. Gold's help, Henry warns he's even worse than Regina. He warns her not to owe Mr. Gold any more favors.

Emma confronts Regina about the article, saying she's most worried about Henry's well-being. Regina insists she did nothing wrong. As they're walking out of Town Hall, where there are ""wet paint"" signs all around, a door blasts open with a fire raging behind it. Regina can't move. Emma freezes for a moment while looking at the fire.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Rumple tells his son about how he'll use the power of the magic dagger for good if he gets it. His son thinks he should go and fight. Rumple tells him it's not a fight, it's a sacrifice. His son then asks if the knight's story of how Rumple ran from battle was true. He also asks if his mother is really dead, as Rumple has told him, or if she left him -- as the knight suggested. Rumple says she's dead. He then explains the plan to raid the duke's castle. He says it's made of stone, but the floors and rafters are made of wood -- and wood burns.

Back at Town Hall, Emma steps away. Regina incredulously suggests Emma is going to leave her. Instead, Emma grabs a fire extinguisher and puts the flames down just enough to pull Regina and get them both to safety. Outside, Regina says because the firefighters have arrived, they weren't really in danger. Emma starts to say, ""Next time I'll just..."" But stops herself and says next time she'll do the same thing, and again the time after that, ""because that's what decent people do."" She leaves. Sidney comes and takes a picture of Regina, calling her ""the victim,"". Regina tells him he's trying to hand the election to Emma. Emma, meanwhile, is telling Henry they don't have to fight dirty. But she finds a rag and takes it to Mr. Gold's shop. She tells him she's not willing to use such tactics to win her election. He warns her to think of what she'll be giving away and who she might be disappointing.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Rumple and his son set a pile of grass ablaze outside the duke's castle and it sets the whole place on fire. Rumple walks through the flames and grabs the dagger off a wall, where it was hidden behind a curtain.

It's the day of the sheriff's election debate. Mary Margaret sees David (Josh Dallas) while she is putting up fliers for Emma. He's putting posters up for Sidney because his wife is friends with Regina. Mary Margaret leaves.

Emma is nervous before the debate and tells Mary Margaret she isn't going to win. She wants to show good can actually win. She's worried she'll have no part in his life if she's not the hero or savior.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Rumple tells his son to go home and wait for him. His son says he has a bad feeling. Rumple sends him on his way. After his son is gone, Rumple holds up the dagger and summons ""Zoso,"" the real name of The Dark One. Zoso (Brad Dourif) appears and warns Rumple to wield his power wisely, and then he antagonizes him, questioning whether Rumple's son is really his own child at all -- given their differences in attitude toward fighting in the war. Rumple stabs Zoso, whose dark presence fades, and realizes Zoso was the old beggar. The magic powers are now being transferred over to Rumple, with Zoso telling him the magic comes with a price and he wanted to relieve himself of the burden of living with such power. Rumple asks why this is happening. Zoso tells him, ""I know how to recognize a desperate soul."" After Zoso dies, Rumple pulls the dagger from Zoso's chest to see the name Rumplestiltskin is now emblazoned on it.

Back at the debate, which is moderated by Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), who tells voters to listen to their consciences, Sidney says he wants to serve as a ""reflection"" of ""honesty, neighborliness and strength -- the best qualities of Storybrooke"". Emma acknowledges her ""troubled past,"" and says everyone has overlooked it ""because of the hero thing."" She then explains the fire was a setup by Mr. Gold. She says the worst part is that she let everyone think it was real and she can't win that way.

At the diner, Henry shows up and gives Emma one of the walkie-talkies for standing up to Mr. Gold. He says heroes stand up and expose people like Mr. Gold. Sidney and Regina show up to tell her she won the election in a close vote. Regina hands her the badge. She tells Emma she didn't pick a great friend in Mr. Gold, ""but he sure makes a superlative enemy. Enjoy that.""

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the knight is taking Rumple's son and wondering why no one is around. Suddenly, one of his men is stabbed from behind. The knight kneels down to acknowledge ""The Dark One's"" presence, and sees it's Rumple. Rumple's son watches on, frightened and wondering what's happened to his father, while Rumple makes the knight kiss his boot. But before the knight can do this, Rumple grabs the man's head and twists it, breaking his neck, and proceeds to fatally stab the other three men in the knight's group. Rumple's son is terrified and says he doesn't feel safe. Rumple tells his son, ""I'm not. I protected what belongs to me, and I'm not scared of anything.""

Emma sees Graham's jacket on the coatrack in her new office. Mr. Gold sneaks in to say he thought she'd want it after all. Emma warns Mr. Gold she's armed. He says the whole thing was ""political theater,"" and that no one was going to vote for her unless they gave her some extraordinary quality. He says he knew she could win over the voters by showing she'd stand up to him. ""I know how to recognize a desperate soul,"" he tells her.

Emma asks why he did this. Mr. Gold reminds her of the deal they made a deal some time back and that she owes him a favor. He says, ""Now that you're sheriff, I'm sure we'll find some way for you to pay back what you owe me.""

""Congratulations,"" he says as he walks out, without Emma saying anything in response."

She introduces Henry to her brother Nicholas and they set off to hang out together. Before they leave the store, the store owner stops them and finds stolen stuff in Henry's bag. He's disappointed in the young boy, and asks the siblings, ""Who do you think you are?"" They say nothing.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, we see the fairy-tale version of Eva with her father (guest star Nicholas Lea), who cut down a tree to provide firewood. The father sends the girl and her brother off to collect kindling. Before they leave, he places his compass around his daughter's neck so she won't get lost. Out in the woods, we learn (as if we didn't already know) that the siblings are Hansel & Gretel. When they return to where they left their dad, he's gone. Soon enough, the Evil Queen confronts them and asks what they're doing in her forest.

Back in Storybrooke, the store owner tells Regina that Henry was shoplifting, but she says he doesn't eat candy and ""knows better than to steal."" Regina takes Henry and Emma shows up. She learns that their phone was disconnected because their parents couldn't pay the bill. Emma notices that among they items they were stealing was a tube of toothpaste. Eva asks Emma not to arrest them because it will just make things worse for their parents.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Gretel begs the Queen's forgiveness because they've just lost their father. The Queen tells her guards to seize them. The siblings try to escape, but the Queen wraps them up with vines from the forest floor and tells them that trying to escape from her was foolish ""but brave."" She says their bravery might have saved their lives. She says she's going to find their father because they are gong to do something for her.

In Storybrooke, Emma drives the siblings home and Eva doesn't want Emma to come inside. Eva tells Emma their parents will be embarrassed if she comes in. Emma drops them off and leaves, and Eva and Nicholas then run off to their real house, a boarded-up place. Emma sneaks up on them and asks why they lied to her. She asks where their parents are and Eva responds, ""We don't have any.""

Emma talks to Mary Margaret about the kids, and admits that she hasn't reported the case to Social Services yet. Emma doesn't want to report them because of her own bad experiences in ""the system."" Their mother, Dory Zimmer, died a few years ago. Emma. says their father's whereabouts are unknown. Emma wants to look for their father. Eva begs Emma not to let them be separated.

Emma goes to find Dory Zimmer's death certificate and discovers they've been removed. She next meets with Regina, who says she's already called Social Services. There's a boys' home and a girls' home in Boston that's expecting them that night. Emma is stunned.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Hansel and Gretel are following the Queen to the home of the blind witch. The Queen says she needs them to gets something back from the blind witch. The house its protected by magic, so she can't enter it herself. Children are protected from the spell. The Queen promises she'll find their father if they do this for her. She warns them the witch's house is ""unique."" She tells them that no matter how they're tempted, ""Don't eat anything."" She then moves some tree branches to reveal a magical gingerbread house.

Henry comes to Emma and says the siblings are Hansel & Gretel. He tells Emma that their father must be in Storybrooke, because no one else comes or goes. Henry suddenly asks Emma about his own father. She tells him she was ""pretty young"" and working in a diner off the interstate. She says Henry's dad was training to be a firefighter and came to the diner late a lot of nights. They spent a lot of time together, then his life got better and her life got worse. She went to jail, and when she got out she learned that Henry's father died saving a family from a fire. She tells Henry his father was a real hero. Henry asks if she has any pictures of him, and she says she doesn't. But then she leaves to see if Eva or Nicholas have anything they've hung onto from their father. Emma shows them a blanket made by her mother that she's kept with her throughout the years. Eva says she might have something. She hands over a compass. Eva says their mom kept it, saying it was their father's.

In Fairy Tale Land, Hansel & Gretel enter the blind witch's house, which is made of candy and has tones of sweets inside. The witch (guest star Emma Caulfield) is sleeping and the satchel the Queen wanted them to steal is hanging near her. Gretel goes to get the satchel and Hansel picks up a delicious-looking cupcake. Hansel takes a bite and the witch wakes up. The kids try to escape, but all the doors and windows slam shut. The witch exclaims, ""I smell dinner!""

Emma pays a visit to Mr. Gold and shows him the compass, to see if he knows where it could have come from. It's crystal, he says, and it's an unusual piece. He says it was bought at his store. He checks his records and finds a card and asks ""forgiveness"" in exchange for the information on the buyer. She proposes ""tolerance"" instead, and Mr. Gold says that's a start. He tells her it was bought by a Michael Tillman. Emma leaves, and we see the card Mr. Gold was reading from was blank.

Emma finds Michael and he says it's ""not possible,"" and that Dory was ""a one-time thing."" She tells him about the twins and that they're about to be shipped off to Boston. He doubts they're even his, but Emma shows him the compass. He says he lost it, and Emma guesses it was ""12 years and 9 months ago."" Emma gives Michael a passionate speech about how he'll have to answer to his children someday if he refuses to connect with them. He apologizes and tells her he doesn't know anything about being a dad.

Emma tells Mary Margaret that their father doesn't want the kids. Mary Margaret suggests Emma tell them the truth -- the way Emma did with Henry about his father. Emma admits she didn't tell Henry the truth -- ""Henry's father was no hero, and trust me he doesn't have to know the real story."" Regina walks up and tells Emma she's supposed to be on the interstate headed to Boston with the kids.

Back in the blind witch's house, Hansel & Gretel are trapped and she's preparing to roast them. With some quick thinking, and a bit of luck, Hansel and Gretel turn the tables on the witch, pushing her into the oven and escaping from the house while she screams for someone to let her out.

Hansel & Gretel return to the Evil Queen with the satchel, and Gretel hands it to her. She opens it and pulls out a beautiful, red apple. She explains to Hansel that it's not just an apple, ""it's a weapon -- a weapon for a very particular and devious enemy, one who's still under the illusion that she's safe."" Gretel asks the Queen to keep her promise and find their father. The Queen tells them they deserve more than a father who'll abandon them in the forest. She decides to reward them by having them live with her in the castle. Gretel instead demands that they get their father back. She says they wouldn't want to live with anyone as terrible as her, vowing to find their father with or without the Queen's help. ""We'll see about that,"" the Queen says, sending up a swirl of purple dust around them.

In Storybrooke, Emma packs Eva and Nicholas into her car and prepares to head out for Boston. Henry warns her they can't leave Storybrooke because something bad will happen. Emma says, ""Something bad has already happened,"" and drives off.

Heading out of town, Emma's car engine stalls and she calls for help.

In Fairy Tale Land, The Evil Queen sees in her mirror that Snow White is walking around with a group of dwarves and asks herself, ""When did that happen?"" Hansel & Gretel's father is brought to her. She tells him they're gone and she's told them he abandoned them. She wants to know why her children would have refused having everything they wanted from her, and he tells her it's because they're a family, and ""family always finds one another."" The Queen tells her guards to release him, and says they can all be together -- as soon as they all find one another. Hansel & Gretel wake up in the forest and realize the Queen has let them go.

In Storybrooke, Emma and the twins wait for help, and as a tow truck approaches, Eva sees that her compass is spinning. Michael shows up and sees the kids are in the car. At this point, he knows Emma's car is fine. She tells Michael that she was scared of coming to Storybrooke for Henry, too, and now she says she couldn't go back after having met him and gotten to know him. Michael asks Emma if she's taking them to Boston. She says she doesn't have to, and he tells her not to. Michael goes to the car to see them.

Emma gets home and tells Mary Margaret that the twins' dad showed up and changed his mind. This leads to a particularly insightful conversation in which Emma wonders what it'd be like to discover her parents. Mary Margaret tells her she might find out, but Emma thinks not looking is her best approach. Then Emma suddenly tells Mary Margaret about Henry's theory, that Emma was wrapped up in this blanket and placed in a magical wardrobe and sent to Storybrooke to save her from the destruction of Fairy Tale Land by her parents -- one of which is Mary Margaret. They both laugh and Mary Margaret says she thinks she'd remember having had a child. ""You do kind of have my chin,"" Mary Margaret jokes. As Emma's leaving, she spots Emma's blanket and remarks on how pretty it is. Emma says thanks, and leaves. Mary Margaret holds the blanket close and smells it.

Emma finds Henry and is about to tell him the truth about his father -- then decides to continue the lie, saying she's glad she told him. Suddenly a man drives up on a motorcycle. He asks them if this is Storybrooke and whether they know of a place to stay. Emma suggests an inn up the road and after the man rides off, she reminds Henry that he said strangers don't come to Storybrooke

""They don't,"" he says."

The man takes off just as Regina comes walking out, and she wonders who the man is. He warns that a storm is coming.

Mary Margaret rushes off in the morning, telling Emma that she's late for school. She needs to be there by 7:15 to help the kids with their science fair. But we see that she's instead gone to the diner, where David regularly shows up at 7:15. They have a pleasant little conversation before he walks back out to his car, where his wife is waiting. Emma shows up and asks Mary Margaret if she's stalking David. She kind of is. She knows his whole routine, including that ""Thursdays they get Chinese for dinner."" Mary Margaret says she wishes there was a magic cure for love.

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow White meets up with Little Red Riding Hood, who asks about how Snow is dealing with the solitude in the forest. The conversation quickly turns to the fact that Prince James is marrying Midas' daughter in two days. Snow says she can't forget him. She wishes ""there was a way to get him out of my head."" Red gestures something, and Snow presses her about what she knows. Red says ""there are whispers of a man who can achieve even the most unholy of requests -- a man who can do what you ask."" Snow wants to know who it is.

We next see her meeting up with Rumpelstiltskin. He likes her boat and says he's been looking forward to meeting her. She says she needs a cure for a broken heart. He puts together a potion that he says will make her unable to remember who the prince is the next time she sees him. He's plucked a strand of hair from her head and says that's all he wants in return. She asks but gets no straight answer when he asks what he wants with it.

Mary Margaret runs into Kathryn at the store -- literally. They inadvertently bump into each other and their baskets both spill onto the floor. Kathryn finds a massive chocolate bar that Mary Margaret is buying, while Mary Margaret picks up a pregnancy test that Kathryn is buying. Mary Margaret politely wishes Kathryn luck with the test. Regina sees the whole scene and tells Mary Margaret to ""be discreet,"" adding, ""their lives are their business.""

Back in Fairy Tale Lane, Prince James gets a crown from his father, which he says is a gift from King Midas. Prince James says he could feed the kingdom for an entire winter with the crown. The king asks James for some enthusiasm, and says he wants his heart. James claims his heart will belong to Abigail, but the king knows James' heart is ""held by another."" He tells James to forget about it, even though James says this was a role he never wanted to play. When the king leaves, James writes a letter to Snow and sends it off with a messenger dove.

Back in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret finds a dove caught in a net. She takes it to the animal shelter, where David works, and the vet there tells her the dove should be OK, but is a rare breed that forms monogamous relationships and it ""won't be happy here"" even if it heals. Mary Margaret figures she has to get it back near home, but David thinks it's a bad idea with the storm coming. Mary Margaret says no one deserves to be ""lost forever, completely alone,"" so she's going to try to beat the storm and take the bird home. David offers to drive, but Mary Margaret thinks she should go alone.

Regina asks Emma about the stranger in town and wants to know who he's there and why. Emma suggests he might be one of the thousands Regina has cursed. Regina doesn't know what she means, and Emma refers to Henry's ""stories."" Regina tells Emma that the man took a particular interest in Henry, which gets Emma's attention.

Mary Margaret drives through the coming storm with the dove in a cage on the passenger's seat of her truck. We get a quick flash to Fairy Tale Land, where we see the dove deliver a note from Prince James. He asks her to come to him and show him she feels the same so they can be together forever. ""And if you don't, I will have my answer,"" he writes.

Now, we see Mary Margaret get out of her truck with the bird, then quickly cut back to Fairy Tale Land, where Snow pulls a hood over her head to bring in flowers for Prince James from the kingdom of Midas. A coordinator isn't so sure about letting her in, but does -- warning to take the service stairwell ""or the guards will toss you over the wall."" She sneaks all the way to James' room, and even hides as he walks by her, but her delay is costly, as a knight grabs her from behind and takes her to a cell. He reads the note James sent her and says ""the king will decide your fate."" Snow tries to climb a craggy wall to escape, but falls and hits her head on the ground. She comes to and little fellow with big ears in a cell next to her tells her he's tried everything. He explains his name is Grumpy. She says she has to escape because there's someone she loves and she's not going to lose him. He tells her his story of love -- he worked at a diamond mine and traded all his money to a foreman to get a diamond so he could propose, but the diamond had been stolen and he took the blame. ""I'm no thief,"" he says, ""but they think I am."" He says he should've known better but he wasn't thinking clearly all because of love.

""I know a way out,"" says a voice from somewhere else. It's another dwarf named Stealthy,"" who snuck in and knocked out the guards with a sleeping gas that ""Doc"" whipped up. Stealthy opens Grumpy's cell and as they're leaving, Snow wishes Grumpy luck and says, ""I hope you get your love back."" Perhaps against his better judgment, Grumpy takes the key and opens Snow's cell, as well.

Back in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret brings the dove to where its flock is, but lighting strikes the cliff where Mary Margaret is standing. She slips and winds up hanging precariously off the edge of the cliff.

Mary Margaret struggles to climb back up and David appears, pulling her up to safety. ""You really think I'd let you come out here alone?"" he asks her. Mary Margaret races back to the cage to get the dove, but David insists it isn't safe to stick around.

Stealthy, Grumpy and Snow are sneaking around through castle, but Snow thinks they should go one way and Stealthy thinks they should go another. Grumpy follows Stealthy and Snow stays behind. Soon enough, the dwarves are stopped by guards. Stealthy tries to run and is shot with an arrow by a sniper (which must be why we hadn't heard of him before). The king asks Grumpy where the girl is, and when Grumpy claims he doesn't know who they're talking about, the king orders him killed. Before the sword is swung at his neck, though, Snow shows up and threatens to burn down the castle if the king doesn't let Grumpy go. He does, and Grumpy gets away, but the king wants to talk to Snow, who is handcuffed.

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret and David find shelter from the storm in the form of an empty cabin. Conveniently enough, there's a fire burning in the fireplace. Mary Margaret admits to David that she still has feelings for him. She says she goes to Granny' at 7:15 every morning to see him, but being around him is too painful because he chose Kathryn over her. He laughs, and admits that the reason he goes to Granny's every morning at 7:15 is to see her. He leans in for a kiss, and Mary Margaret backs away and asks him, ""How can you do this?"" She says she knows that Kathryn thinks she's pregnant.

""What?"" David responds.

Emma shows up to confront the stranger, telling him he's suspicious. He claims he was only in front of Henry's house because that's where his motorcycle broke down. She then asks him about his mystery box, but he tells her she's ""going to have to wait a long time"" before he reveals what's in it. Or, he says, she can let him buy her a drink and he'll tell her right now. She agrees, and he opens the box. It's a typewriter. He says he finds Storybrooke provides ""inspiration."" She asks if he's been there before, and he replies, ""I didn't say that."" He gets up to leave, and Emma asks about that drink.

""I said 'sometime,'"" he says before leaving.

David says he didn't know Kathryn thought she might be pregnant, and says they weren't trying to have a baby. The storm has stopped, though, and Mary Margaret goes back outside to release the dove to join its flock. They watch it fly away, and David tries to hold Mary Margaret's hand. She says they can't, but he tries to convince her otherwise. He says he feels like he has ""two conflicting lives -- memories of feelings for her, and real feelings for you."" She says they're going to have to forget each other, and walks away.

The king tells Snow that ""love is a disease -- and like all diseases, if can be vanquished in one of two ways: a cure or death."" He tells Snow to walk down to James' room, tell him she got his letter, and that she doesn't love him. He says it will break James' heart, and that will cure him. Snow thinks that if she doesn't do this, the king will kill her. But he says he'll kill James instead. He says killing Snow would just make James love her more, and the marriage and kingdom would crumble. But if an assassin killed him, he'd died a martyr and Midas would laud the death and the merger of kingdoms would be complete.

""You would do that to your own son,"" Snow says.

""He's not my son,"" the king replies.

We next see Snow enter James' room, and he's ecstatic to see her. He pulls in for a huge hug. She then tells him that they ""can't happen."" He tells her they can leave all this, and she tearfully tells him she doesn't love him. She tells him to fill his heart with love for someone else, ""someone who can love you the way I never have -- the way I never will.""

Back at his house, David and Kathryn talk. She says she feels like he's ""here, but not here."" She says it's been hard on her, and that she wants a family and children with him. She says she thought she was pregnant, but when the test came back negative she was upset at first, but then relieved. She says she wants to fix their relationship, and he agrees. She asks him to join her in seeing Dr. Hopper to get help. He tells her he knows they should be in love, and he wants to make that work. She notes it's 7:10, and they should leave if he wants to get coffee at the diner before work. He suggests that they instead have breakfast at home.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Snow cries as she walks away from the castle. Grumpy walks alongside her, and six other dwarves are with him. He asks Snow if she found her love, and she says, ""Worse, I lost him."" Grumpy invites her to join them on their trip home. ""We all lost someone today,"" he says. Doc notes, ""Now we're seven.""

Grumpy says they're going to protect her. She says the only thing that needed protecting was her heart, ""and now it's destroyed."" Grumpy tells her it will get better, and she agrees -- pulling the potion out. She says it will erase all her pain. Grumpy tells her not to do it -- he says he doesn't want his pain erased. It makes him who he is. ""It makes me Grumpy,"" he says. He tells her to keep the potion, and if the pain is too much she can always drink it. ""But, for now, put it away,"" he says. She agrees, and they continue walking.

Emma notices it's 7:15 and Mary Margaret hasn't left yet. She holds her hand.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Prince James has ridden out to the forest looking for Snow. Red sees him, and tells him that Snow never came back after she went to find the prince.

""Then I'll find her,"" he says. ""I will always find her.""

Grumpy comes running into the dwarves' house with news that the royal wedding is off -- that her Prince Charming isn't getting married to Abigail.

Snow has a blank look on her face, then asks, ""Who?""

Grumpy notices the empty potion vial on the nightstand.

Back in Storybrooke, it's 7:45 and Mary Margaret gets her coffee at the diner. David walks in, sees Mary Margaret and leaves. But she chases him. He says he's trying not to see her, and she says she's trying not to see him, too. They don't know how to resolve this, but when David tells Mary Margaret that Kathryn isn't pregnant, they kiss -- right in the middle of the street.

Regina, in her car across the street, sees it all."

He's pleased to see it's still there after the storm. Regina finds Henry talking with Emma at the castle, and Regina isn't happy that Emma lets Henry play around the castle, which she says is dangerous. Regina tells Emma not to let her feelings cloud her judgment.

Mary Margaret runs off from lunch with Emma to meet up with David, who's texted her a message saying they need to meet. Sidney shows up, drunk, telling Emma he can help bring Regina down. Emma tells him to go home and sleep it off, but he leaves his card and tells Emma to call him, because ""Storybrooke deserves to know the truth about her.""

We zoom in on Sidney's face and find ourselves seeing Sidney's Fairy Tale Land persona: The Genie of Agrabah -- and he emerges from his bottle to grant three wishes for a king who wants for nothing. The genie wishes to be free, and the king makes that his first wish. For his second wish, the king wishes to give his third and final wish to the genie. The genie says that making a wish always comes with a price and he'll never use the wish. The genie says he'll use his newfound freedom to find true love, and the king invites him to his palace. There, the king introduces the genie to his daughter, Snow, and his wife, Regina. The genie and Regina seem to know each other, but say nothing upon their introduction.

Emma shows up to the castle to find Henry watching it being torn down by a demolition crew. Henry also says his book is gone. Regina tells Emma it was dangerous, so she had to tear it down. She also tells Emma to learn her place in this town, or she'll no longer be in it. Regina leaves, and Emma calls Sidney to tell him she's in and wants everyone to know about who Regina really is.

Mary Margaret meets David on the bridge, and he rushes her off to a picnic he's arranged. They kiss and Mary Margaret says they ""have to stop doing this.""

Emma, meanwhile, meets Sidney in a secluded tunnel. He tells her that $50,000 is missing from the town's budget and Regina is responsible. Emma isn't impressed, but he's certain it will help them get to the bottom of Regina's secrets. He wants her phones tapped, but Emma insists they do this ""by the book."" Sidney warns Emma to be prepared for her wrath. When Emma asks Sidney how he allowed himself to get so wrapped up in Regina's world, he says he ""used to think she was a different person.""

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the king tells a group gathered at a party that his beautiful daughter Snow is his one lasting reminder of her mother, who, like Snow, ""truly was the fairest in all the land."" The Queen cries and leaves the room. The genie follows her out and talks to her. She says no matter how hard she tries to please the king, she'll never fit the way Snow's mother did. They stand at the Queen's apple tree, which she says is like her -- trapped in the castle and also out of place. The genie commiserates with her and gives her a mirror so that she can see herself as he does: ""As the fairest in all the land.""

Back in Storybrooke, Emma and Sidney scour records and Emma discovers that some records are missing. Mary Margaret shows up. When Emma and Sidney realize they can't get a judge to issue a search warrant because Regina owns them all, Sidney suggests they do the investigation his way. He says ""sometimes doing a bad thing for a good reason is OK."" Mary Margaret chimes in, somewhat anxiously agreeing that if you're doing something wrong, but maybe it's meant to be, maybe it's right, ""does that make you a bad person?"" They agree to go talk to Regina.

They confront Regina about the missing $50,000. She says that the records probably burned in the fire, and insists she has nothing to hide. Emma tells Regina they have nothing, and she and Sidney leave. On their way out, Emma reveals that she planted a bug on Regina's desk.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the king calls the genie and says he thinks his wife's heart ""belongs to another man."" The genie assures him the Queen would never stray, but the king shows the genie her diary, which has a note about the mirror the genie gave her, which gave her hope for love. The king says he realizes the Queen is unhappy and yearns for someone to love her ""like I never can."" But he can't imagine that she would betray him. He asks the genie to learn the identity of the man ""who has stolen"" the Queen's heart. The genie takes the job.

Sidney is checking the tapes of Regina's calls and has something about a meeting Regina is setting up, where she's going to exchange a large amount of cash with an unknown person. That night, they follow Regina out to the woods, but the Sheriff's car's brakes go out and Emma crashes into a highway sign. They get out and Sidney says someone's tampered with the brakes, and thinks Regina's found the bug. Mr. Gold emerges and says Regina was meeting him to purchase his land. He wants to know why they're following Regina around. He warns them that ""emotional entanglements can lead us down very dangerous paths.""

In Fairy Tale Land, the Queen's father meets the genie at the apple tree and asks him to take a box to her, where she's being held by the king's guards. Inside the box, he says, is the only thing that can free the Queen ""from this wretched life.""

Emma now wants to break into Regina's office to find records that link her to the land. She gets the files, and also finds a massive key ring with a bunch of keys. She starts looking for Henry's book when Regina shows up. Emma says some kids broke in so she responded -- because she's the Sheriff. She says Sidney came along because he was walking by and saw, so he's a witness. Emma offers to tear the place apart to find evidence of whether anything was taken, but Regina says her services are no longer wanted.

Back in the king's castle, the Queen gives the genie a huge embrace and says her love for him grows stronger every day. But she says there's no escape. He hands her the box and tells her that her father said what's inside will help her escape. She opens the box to find two Agrabah vipers, snakes so deadly they kill with just one bite. She tells him that with one small bite and she can ""be free from this prison forever."" She tells the genie she's sorry they can't be together, but ""perhaps in another life we will find each other again."" She extends her hand toward the the box, but he grabs it and says there is another way. ""What if the king didn't live?"" he asks. He says that for her he would do anything. She hugs him and says she doesn't know what she would do without him. He tells her she'll never have to find out.

The stranger finds Henry at the diner trying to draw everything he remembers from his book before he forgets it. Henry asks the man what he's doing in Storybrooke. He says he's a writer who's doing ""stuff"" in town. He wishes Henry luck with the stories.

Emma and Sidney find escrow documents showing she's looking to build something huge for personal use, but Emma is upset because they've stooped to her level and none of the evidence will be admissible in court. Sidney says they don't need her to go to jail -- just to expose her to the town for what she really is. Sidney then shows Emma a bunch of pictures he took of Emma and Henry while following them around town on Regina's orders. He says Regina knew about their secret place -- the castle -- weeks ago and was just waiting to destroy it until it would hurt them most.

At a City Council meeting, Sidney stands up with something to say, but Regina tells him to sit down. Emma stands up, as well, and announces that Regina is spending thousands of dollars of the city's money to build herself a fancy second home in the woods. Emma goes on to tell the crowd that Sidney was fired because he stood up to Regina and questioned her. She then turns to Regina and calls her a thug who doesn't care about anyone but herself. Regina says Emma is right. She says she is building a house -- a playhouse. She says she wanted to build a playhouse Henry and all the children of Storybrooke could have a place to play safely. She says the design is based on a sketch she found in one of Henry's books. Emma and Sidney are both embarrassed.

In Fairy Tale Land, the genie stands over the king while he's sleeping. He whispers, ""Forgive me, "" then opens the box to release the snakes in the king's bed. The king wakes up for a moment before the two snakes bite his neck. The genie tells the king, who quickly feels the effects of the poisonous bites, that he is the man who gave the Queen the mirror and that he's forever grateful that the king gave him his freedom. The king grabs the genie's hand and tells him he was right, that he should have never made that wish. The genie looks stunned.

Outside, after the City Council meeting, Mr. Gold tells Emma she's going to need a strong ally if she really wants to bring Regina down. Emma turns down his offer. Regina comes up and asks Emma to go back to her job, which is upholding the law, not breaking it. Regina tells Emma she's not allowed to see Henry anymore unless she says so.

Emma finds Henry playing at the new playhouse. He sees her from afar and they chat over the walkie-talkie, where Emma explains that she messed up and can't see him for a while. She tells Henry she's going to try to find his book, but he says ""it's probably gone and it's probably never coming back.""

We next see the stranger in a house opening the box where Henry kept his book and pulling it out.

Emma and Sidney meet up for a beer at the diner and wonder how they missed everything. Sidney says there are a lot more skeletons in Regina's closet. He says the good news is that she's got herself an ally. Emma vows, they ""won't get fooled again.""

In Fairy Tale Land, the genie comes to the Queen, who sadly tells him the guards found the snakes and know they're from the genie's country. ""They know it was you who killed the king,"" she says. ""It's only a matter of time before they catch you. You will be executed."" She says she's arranged for a boat to provide him safe passage out of the kingdom. The genie realizes the Queen set it all up. Of all the snakes in the world she could have chosen, he knows she chose the Agrabah viper so the murder would be traced back to him. He says she never loved him. She says he's no longer of any use to her, and tells her to flee the kingdom and never come back. She repeated to the genie that she doesn't love him and says ""there is no way we will ever be together."" The genie says there is one way. He pulls out the bottle and uses his last wish -- to be together with the Queen always, to never leave her side. Suddenly, he vanishes in a puff of blue dust and she looks around for him. She hears the genie's muffled screams and pulls out her mirror, where she sees him inside, pounding at the glass from within.

""Well it looks like you got your wish,"" Regina says with a wry smile. ""You will be with me -- forever.""

Back in Storybrooke, Regina meets with Sidney , who reveals a tape of his conversation with Emma. They've been together on this all along. Regina tells Sidney that cutting the brakes on Emma's car was ""inspired."" Sidney assures Regina that everything Emma does, she'll know about it. Regina looks at Sidney closely and says, ""I don't know what I'd do without you."" He looks back in her eyes, but says nothing."

Avonlea has fallen. An aide laments, ""If only he had come."" The angry Maurice declares ""ogres are not men"" and are ""unstoppable."" His daughter tries assure him about this mysterious figure's pending arrival, suggesting, ""He may be on his way."" Suddenly, a knock on the door and we see Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) mocking Maurice about his plea for help. Rumple says he can help protect Sir Maurice's ""little town -- for a price."" Rumple wants something more special than gold, which had been previously offered -- he wants Maurice's daughter. He wants her as a caretaker for his ""rather large estate."" Maurice orders Rumple out, but his daughters volunteers to go despite her fiance and father's objections. Rumple warns her ""it's forever,"". She agrees to go in exchange for knowing her family and friends will all live. Maurice asks the young woman, Belle (Emilie de Ravin), not to go. ""You can't go with this beast,"" he says. But she tells her father and her fiance, Gaston (Sage Brocklebank), it's been decided.

Back in Storybrooke, Mr. Gold seizes the flower delivery van of a man who's behind on his loan payment. The man was Sir Maurice back in Fairy Tale Land. The truck is taken. Regina (Lana Parrilla) sees it all and wants to chat with Mr. Gold. He doesn't want to talk, and leaves.

David (Josh Dallas) and Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) chat over separate tables at the diner. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) arrives and gets the report from Mary Margaret that Henry is fine. Emma is still not allowed to see him. A friend named Ashley (Cinderella in Fairy Tale Land) shows up. She's just had a baby and her boyfriend has been working double shifts at the cannery. The waitress invites the whole group out for a girls' night, but no one seems interested. Emma gets a call from the station.

We next see Mr. Gold entering his large house, where the door was open. Emma shows up, gun drawn, and says a neighbor called and reported Mr. Gold's front door was open. Mr. Gold says he's been robbed. When Emma notes this seems to happen to him a lot, Mr. Gold says he's a difficult man to love.

We quickly cut to Fairy Tale Land, where Rumple is showing Belle to her ""room"" -- a dungeon. He locks her in.

Rumple tells Belle about all the duties she'll perform. She drops a teacup when he says one of the things she'll do is skin the children he hunts. He says this was just a quip, and she sees the teacup she dropped is chipped. He doesn't care, saying, ""It was just a cup.""

In Storybrooke, Mr. Gold wants Emma to leave, but she needs to know more. Mr. Gold tells her the thief was the flower deliverer whose van he's just seized.

In Fairy Tale Land, Belle asks Rumple why he spins so much. He says it helps him ""forget."" When she asks what he's trying to forget, he says he can't remember -- so it must have worked. She's trying to pull the drapes open to let some light in, but he'd nailed them in place. She tugs one and falls from her ladder, and Rumple catches her. She thanks him, and when she offers to put the drapes back up, he says it won't be necessary. He'll get used to it.

Emma tells Mr. Gold she's recovered his things from the flower guy's place. Mr. Gold insists there's something missing. Emma says she'll get it, and Mr. Gold says, ""Not if I find him first.""

Back at Rumple's place, Belle tells him she thinks he wanted here there because he's lonely. She says she noticed small clothing, for a child. She asks if there was a son. He says there was. ""I lost him,"" he says, ""as I did his mother."" She asks if this means he was, in fact, an ordinary man. She wants to get to know him, especially if she's never going to meet anyone again. He says he thinks she's just trying ""to learn the monster's weaknesses."" She tells him he's not a monster. A loud knock on the door turns out to be Gaston, who Rumple turns into a pile of dust and a rose with the snap of a finger. Rumple brings the rose back to Belle, saying the knock was from an old woman selling flowers. He asks what made her choose to come with him. She says ""heroism, sacrifice."" She says she's glad she saved her village. He asks her about Gaston. She says it was an arranged marriage and she never really cared for Gaston. She says she thinks love is layered and she could never give her heart to someone as superficial as Gaston. She asks again about his son. He tells her to go to town and fetch some straw, and when she returns he'll tell his tale. She asks if he trusts her to come back, and he says, no -- he doesn't expect to ever see her again.

Storybrooke's girls' night has Ashley pounding drinks. The waitress checks out guys and urges Ashley to join, saying she's not married to Sean and he's always working.

Mr. Gold sees David at a store buying two Valentine's cards. David claims the two cards are for the same woman, he just couldn't decide which to choose. Mr. Gold says he's fortunate to have someone who loves him, and makes his purchase, which include rope and duct tape.

""Love is like a delicate flame,"" Mr. Gold says, ""and once it's gone, it's gone forever."" We next see Mr. Gold driving a van with the flower guy bound in the back.

Mr. Gold has brought the flower guy to a cabin, and says he doesn't normally let people get away.

Belle is walking through the forest when the Queen's caravan comes by and stops. The Queen decides to walk with Belle for a stretch. She probes a bit and determines Belle is running from a ""master and lover."" Belle admits she ""might"" love her employers, but ""something evil has taken root in him."" The Queen says it sounds like a curse. A kiss borne of true love could break it.

Belle returns to Rumple's place and is giddy, though he tells Belle he's just ""not unhappy"" she's back. She then takes her place to hear the story about Rumple's son. He says he lost his son and there's nothing more to tell, really. Rumple asks why she came back. Belle says she wasn't going to, but then something changed her mind. She kisses him, and he feels odd -- and we see his weird coloring begin to change. Belle tells him to kiss her again, adding, ""any curse can be broken."" Rumple jumps back and asks about who told her that. He thinks the Queen has aimed to turn Belle against him. He's enraged, and shouts at Belle, who asks why he doesn't believe their kiss was one of true love, saying, ""Because no one, no one can ever love me!"" He tosses her back into her dungeon.

Back in the cabin, the flower guy wants to explain but Rumple chokes the man by pressing the end of his cane into the guy's throat. He says he wants to know ""where it is"" and who told him to take it. The man says he needed his van. Mr. Gold beats him with the cane, and the man says ""it wasn't my fault."" Mr Gold continues to beat the man, saying, ""You shut her out. You had her love, and you shut her out. She's gone forever, she's not coming back and it's your fault, not mine.""

We then flash to Rumple smashing things up in his castle.

We flash back to the cabin, where Emma has grabbed Mr. Gold's cane and told him to stop.

Flashing back again to Rumple's destruction of things in his castle, he flings teacups across the room, smashing them into pieces on the wall. But when he sees the chipped teacup, he stops, puts it on the table and walks away.

At girls' night, Ashley tells Mary Margaret she needs a ""be-at-home-with-my-guy night."" Mary Margaret says she understands, being in love with someone you can't be with is ""a terrible burden."" Shawn shows up at the bar, taking a break from work, and asks Ashley to marry him. She says yes, and everyone cheers. After Ashley leaves, Mary Margaret stands outside and David asks, ""How's girls' night?"" He gives her a Valentine's card. She opens it, and it reads, ""Cathryn, I love you."" He apologizes and hands her the other card. Mary Margaret tells him he should go home to Cathryn.

Emma tells Mr. Gold he has a funny definition of justice. Emma asks who Mr. Gold was talking about when he was telling the flower guy he ""hurt her"" and ""what happened to her?"" When Mr. Gold refuses to cooperate, Emma arrests him.

Back in Rumple's castle, he enters her dungeon and tells her to go. He says he doesn't want her anymore. She gets up to leave, but stops and tells him he could have been free if he'd just believed someone would want him. She calls him a coward, but he says he just made a decision his power means more to him than she does. She tells him he's going to regret it, and all he'll have ""is an empty heart and a chipped cup.""

At the station. Emma tells Mr. Gold -- who's locked up -- she still owes him a favor. She offers half of her pastrami sandwich. He says when he does decide to redeem the favor, it'll be for more than a half a sandwich. Regina shows up and tells Emma she can have 30 minutes with Henry, which would mean leaving Regina alone with Mr. Gold. Emma takes it and leaves.

Mr. Gold says when two people both want something the other has, a deal can always be struck. He asks Regina (Lana Parrilla) if she has what he wants. She says yes. Mr. Gold looks shaken. When he asks Regina what she wants, she asks him his real name. He claims his name is Mr. Gold. She says if he wants what she has, he'll tell her his real name. He manages to choke out the word: Rumplestiltskin.

Pleased with herself, Regina pulls the chipped teacup from her purse and mocks Mr. Gold for it as she hands it to him, referring to the cup as a ""sentimental keepsake.""

""Thank you, your majesty,"" he says.

Mr. Gold warns Regina he really has the power in Storybrooke, and nothing between them will change.

""We shall see,"" she says.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the Queen shows up at Rumple's place and says she has a request concerning a mermaid. Rumple doesn't want to talk about it, and the Queen asks if he's angry with her. He says her little deception failed, and she'll never be more powerful than him. He tells her she can keep trying, but she's never going to beat him. She asks if it's ""about that little girl I met on the road."" When he says her name was Belle, the Queen tells Rumple she had ""nothing to do with that tragedy.""

He asks, ""What tragedy?""

The Queen explains after Belle returned home, her fiance was gone, her father shut her out, locked her in a tower. She says Belle threw herself off the tower and died. Rumple thinks the Queen is lying, and asks her to leave. The Queen notes on her way out the place is getting dusty and he should ""get a new girl.""

Rumple goes to a cabinet, pulls out the chipped cup and puts it on a pedestal, crying.

Back in Storybrooke, Regina goes into a special-access area of the hospital and heads downstairs. She hands a nurse a rose and asks, ""Has anyone been in to see her?""

The nurse tells Regina, ""Not today -- not ever.""

Regina goes down a creepy hallway, opens a small slot in a door and looks inside, where we see the Storybrooke version of Belle, locked up and stunned to see Regina's face looking through the slot in the door."

The knights race off, but the king brushes it off to Abigail and tells a knight, ""Find him."" We next see Prince Charming evading the knights who are chasing him. But he's soon captured by two men in purple cloaks.

In Storybrooke, Kathryn tells David she applied to law school and was accepted. It's in Boston. She thinks a fresh start is what they need, focusing on making new memories rather than chasing old ones.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, we see that the prince's captors were working for Abigail, who confronts him and tells him she knows he's in love with Snow White. She says she's come to help him escape -- because she doesn't want to marry him, either.

In Storybrooke, David goes for a walk with Mary Margaret, who thinks they have to tell Kathryn the truth about them, and everything. David isn't sure he can. Mary Margaret thinks being honest with others is the only way they can be honest with each other. She tells him, ""The only way no one gets hurt here is if we don't want to be together."" He says he doesn't want that, and she insists he make a choice and tells Kathryn.

""I choose you,"" David tells Mary Margaret. She tells him to tell Kathryn, and walks away.

Emma runs into the motorcycle guy at the diner, who asks about their date. Emma wants to know his name. He tells her it's August W. Booth, he says, clarifying that the W is for Wayne. He invites her to meet him there after work. She goes inside to meet Mary Margaret, who's curious. They get back to talking about Mary Margaret, who admits she hasn't been staying away from David. Emma has known, but didn't say so. Mary Margaret tells Emma that David is telling Kathryn everything.

We next see Kathryn and David, and he tells her he can't go to Boston with her. She asks for the truth, and whether there's something going on she doesn't know about. He says no. He says he doesn't know what it is, but there's something that's preventing him from connecting. He says she's right about needing a fresh start, but not with him.

In Fairy Tale Land, Abigail and her caravan escort the prince to her father's kingdom. Before he leaves, he wants to know what's really going on. She says her heart also belongs to another -- a man named Frederick, who she was once intended to wed. The prince says he can't help her, because his love told him she doesn't feel the same way for him as he does for her. He calls this his tragedy, but she says it isn't a tragedy. She walks him over to what appears to be a statue of Frederick. It isn't a statue, though. It's Frederick, who was turned to gold when he jumped to push King Midas to safety during a battle. In hopes of bringing Frederick back to life, she'd have to reverse the curse, and she tells the prince about Lake Nostos whose waters are said to have magical properties that can return to you something that's been lost. The prince vows to get to the lake and its water, despite the guards who surround it.

We next see August making a copy of Henry's book.

Regina gives Henry a gift -- a video game joystick. She asks him again not to be upset with him for tearing down the playground and losing his book. Henry says he wants to see Emma. Regina doesn't say anything as Kathryn shows up and interrupts them. Kathryn's crying and tells Regina about David leaving her. Regina immediately calls out Mary Margaret for being a homewrecker, and Regina breaks the news to Kathryn that Mary Margaret and David have been having an affair. Kathryn asks for proof and Regina shows her pictures Sidney had taken. Regina says she didn't say anything because she wanted Kathryn and David to work it out. Regina says she wanted that because she's Kathryn's friend, but Kathryn says a friend wouldn't lie.

In Fairy Tale Land, the prince reaches a shrine where anyone who attempts to get to the lake is meant to leave an offering. He tosses his helmet toward and heads for the lake, leaving Abigail behind.

In Storybrooke, David tells Mary Margaret that he told Kathryn, and she tells him he did the right thing. Kathryn shows up at Mary Margaret's school and slaps her in the middle of a hallway. Kathryn yells at her in the hallway while others watch. Mary Margaret is stunned to realize that David didn't actually tell Kathryn about their romance.

In Fairy Tale Land, the prince easily reaches the lake and dips a canteen in for water. Soon, he hears a rumbling and draws his sword, calling out to whomever is headed toward him to show themselves. Soon, a beautiful siren emerges from the lake and catches the prince's glance.

August gets to the diner and asks Emma to hop onto the back of his motorcycle. He drives her out to a ""watering hole."" It's a well. He says there's a legend about the well -- that its water is fed by a lake that has magical properties. The water from the well is said to return something lost to you. They toast and drink the water.

Mary Margaret feels everyone gossiping and whispering about her as she walks down the street. An older woman tells her she should be ashamed of herself.

In Fairy Tale Land, the siren approaches the prince and tells him she can be anyone he wants. He says he won't fall prey to her deceptions, but she raises a handful of water over herself and lets it pour over her -- turning her into Snow White. The prince tries to resist, but gives in and kisses the figure. His sword drops into the lake. The siren tries to lure him into the water, but he says he doesn't want an illusion, he wants the real thing. The siren pushes him into the water and a vine pulls him downward, trapping him under. The prince spots a knife at the bottom of the lake and when the siren returns underwater and plants another kiss on him, he stabs her in the stomach with the knife, then cuts the vine away to swim to the surface.

In Storybrooke, David is trying to clean off the word ""tramp,"" which has been spray painted onto Mary Margaret's car. She finds him, and confronts David about why he didn't tell Kathryn about them. He says he didn't want anyone to get hurt, but she says he not only lied to Kathryn, but he also lied to her. He tells Mary Margaret they have to pick up the pieces and move on if what they have is true love, but she disagrees. She says what they have is destructive and it has to stop. She says they shouldn't be together.

Emma gets to her car and clears off some leaves. In the gutter, she finds a metal case that has Henry's book inside. August watches this from across the street.

Kathryn pays Regina a visit to apologize for her reaction. Kathryn tells Regina that David has never looked at him the way he's looking at Mary Margaret in the pictures. Kathryn says she's coming to understand she's never been in love. She says her marriage to David was ""just like an illusion."" She says she's going to go out there and find love. She's moving to Boston alone. Kathryn tells Regina that she told David that he and Mary Margaret should be together. Regina seems troubled by this development. Kathryn confesses she's ""always had this irrational fear of leaving Storybrooke."" Regina tells her she just might find what she's looking for -- but she says it in that creepy Evil Queen kind of way that makes you know she doesn't mean it.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming returns with water from the lake and gives it to Abigail, who pours the water over the golden Frederick. He comes back to life. Abigail and Frederick kiss. (Frederick is the same guy Kathryn bumped in the school hallway when she went to yell at Mary Margaret). Prince Charming heads out to find Snow White again. Abigail warns him to make haste, because King George will send his men after him. She adds, ""Some people will stop at nothing to destroy the happiness of others.""

We next see Regina sneaking into Kathryn and David's house, and stealing the envelope Kathryn had left for David.

Emma finds Henry playing his video game. She hands him the book. He's surprised, but thinks it's a sign that their luck is changing. She smiles and tells him she hopes he's right.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming is still looking for Snow White, who runs into Little Red Riding Hood. She tells him that Snow went to break up his wedding because she loves him, and that something must have changed her mind. He thinks it wasn't ""something"" but ""someone."" He looks up and sees King George and his knights heading toward them, with the king yelling for the prince's head. He sweeps Red up behind him and gallops off with her.

In Storybrooke, while Kathryn is on her way out of town, we see Regina burning the envelope Kathryn had left for David. Kathryn, meanwhile, is driving down the dark road and we next see the Storybrooke version of Frederick driving upon the scene of Kathryn's car, which has gone off the road just short of the Storybrooke town limit. He walks up to the car and sees the airbag has deployed but there is no one around. Back at Regina's place, the envelope has burned and we zoom in on her mean, evil, smug face."

One warns a newbie, Nova (Amy Acker), about the value of fairy dust, and challenges her to get home safely without losing any. Sure enough, as they take off, a bit of fairy dust shakes loose and lands on a giant egg being tended to by some dwarves. Out of the egg comes another dwarf.

We next see the Storybrooke version of this dwarf, a grumpy fellow named Leroy. He's met by another little person (this one sneezes a lot), who'd like to sit near him at the diner. Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), meanwhile, announces the town's nuns are selling candles for Miners Day. She's looking for volunteers to help sell them and no one steps up. On his way out, Leroy tells Mary Margaret he won't help because he's the only person the town hates more than her. ""Town harlot, town drunk,"" he says, referring to the two of them.

Later, Mary Margaret explains Miners Day to Emma (Jennifer Morrison). The nuns used to make candles and trade them with the miners for coal, and the tradition continues as a fundraiser. Mary Margaret is getting shunned by everyone because of her status as a ""home wrecker."" Emma gets a call and has to leave, telling Mary Margaret to ""hang in there,"" and offering to help.

Volunteers are decorating for Miners Day when some glitter falls on Leroy, who's just passing through. He looks up and we see it's the Storybrooke version of the fairy from earlier. She's fumbling with the lights and Leroy, suddenly smiling, offers to help. She tells him her name is Astrid. Leroy fixes the lights and she thanks him. He tells her he's in the custodial services, despite the fact that he wanted to be a sailor. He wants to sail around the world. Astrid tells him someone once told her, ""You can do anything as long as you can dream it."" He starts to believe her. She leaves and they're both smiling.

Emma is looking at Kathryn's car, which crashed near the Storybrooke town line. Sidney (Giancarlo Esposito) shows up to take some photos as a freelancer, having been fired from the Mirror. Emma finds Kathryn's packed suitcase is still in the trunk of the car. Sidney says he can get Kathryn's phone records to help with the investigation. David (Josh Dallas) pulls up. Emma says she's about to find out how much he knows.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the newly hatched dwarf is being cleaned and asks about the woman he saw just before he hatched, and the dwarf cleaning him up tells him there are no female dwarves. The new dwarf gets the lowdown on the situation: Dwarves are hatched from eggs and they work (they love working -- ""We even whistle while we do it,"" the veteran dwarf tells him). They mine the diamonds that get crushed into dust that give light to the world. He's told that he and his seven brethren will work together. They grab axes which give them their dwarf names. Sure enough, they get their axes: Stealthy, Happy, Doc, Sneezy, Sleepy, Bashful, Dopey and finally, our new dwarf, who we know is ""Grumpy,"" gets an axe that names him Dreamy. ""The axe never lies,"" the veteran tells him.

In Storybrooke, Leroy goes to Mary Margaret to volunteer and sees Sister Astrid being scolded for having ordered 12 dozen helium tanks instead of the 12 they needed. The nun who is scolding her is the same fairy who was giving her orders earlier in the clouds. She explains to Leroy they'll need to sell ""like, a thousand"" candles in order to make up the difference and pay their rent to Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle). Last year they sold 42. He'll evict them if they don't pay. Leroy says they only sold 42 candles last year because they didn't have him. ""This year, you're going to sell all of them,"" Leroy says. Astrid calls him her hero. Mary Margaret is surprised by all of this.

David tells Emma he doesn't know anything about Kathryn's disappearance, and they haven't spoken since he ended things with her. He says Kathryn told him she was going to Boston. Emma vows to find her.

We see Kathryn's phone records being pulled -- by Regina (Lana Parrilla). She calls Sidney to let him know she has them, ""and I think you'll find them quite helpful.""

In Fairy Tale Land, we see Dreamy shoveling for diamonds and the conveyor belt that grinds it up into fairy dust. Nova, the clumsy fairy, has trouble shutting off the valve of fairy dust. Dreamy comes over to help. He recognizes her, but she doesn't know who he is. Distracted by their conversation, she loses her bag of fairy dust and watches helplessly as it is nearly moved into an incinerator. Dreamy chases it down and saves it. She tells him she just wants to be a fairy godmother, but she's too clumsy. He tells her he believes you can do anything you want, ""as long as you can dream it."" She introduces herself as Nova, and he's Dreamy. She tells him about her plans to see the fireflies that night. He tells her it sounds fun, and hopes she'll have a good time. She thanks him again and calls him her hero.

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret struggles to get anyone to buy her candles. Leroy suggests they go sell them door to door, saying they're so despised the customers will pay them just to leave.

Emma finds Sidney playing a game at the carnival. She tells Sidney that Kathryn never showed up in Boston. Emma asks him for the phone records.

Mary Margaret and Leroy get many doors slammed in their faces.

In Fairy Tale Land, the dwarves are having a great time, but Dreamy isn't feeling like himself. Belle (Emilie de Ravin) overhears him telling another dwarf about his woes and she says he's in love. She says love is the most amazing feeling in the world, and if he's in it he needs to enjoy it ""because love doesn't last forever."" He wonders why he feels so bad. Belle explains to Dreamy that Nova wasn't just telling him about fireflies, but suggesting he go see them with her. She encourages him to go find his love, his hope, his dreams.

In Storybrooke, Leroy comes to tell Sister Astrid some bad news. Mary Margaret expects him to tell her they didn't sell any candles, but instead he tells Astrid they were all sold. She gives him a huge hug.

Mary Margaret is livid. He's committed to $5,000 worth of candles and there's no way they can come up with that. Mary Margaret asks why this is so important to him. He says he doesn't want the nuns to leave town. Mary Margaret realizes he likes Astrid and wonders if he could possibly have fallen for someone less available than a nun. He says he's going to get the $5,000.

In Fairy Tale Land, Dreamy gets to the hill just in time to catch Nova. She tells him flying over the world and being a part of it aren't really the same thing. He suggests they could see the world together in a boat and sail. The fireflies come out, and Astrid kisses him and says they should meet the next night and run off together.

In Storybrooke, we see Leroy offering his boat to Mr. Gold for $5,000. Leroy finally tells him he'd like him to forgive a month's rent for the nuns, but Mr. Gold won't budge. He says he'll be within his rights to evict, and he'll be glad to be rid of ""such distasteful tenants."" Mr. Gold says he has his reasons for not liking the nuns, noting he has a long and complicated history with them.

Astrid shows up at the boat and gives Leroy a pie to thank him for his help. She sees the stash of unsold candles and wonders why they're there. Leroy confesses he didn't sell them all. He was afraid of letting her down with the truth. He apologizes for lying, and says she ""believed in the wrong guy."" She leaves.

Sidney brings Kathryn's phone records to Emma. They include an 8-minute call she made to David just an hour before the accident. Emma says that can't be right because David said he hadn't talked to Kathryn that day. Sidney tells Emma not to beat herself up over being fooled by David because she's not the only one he's fooled.

Leroy shows up at the diner to tells Mary Margaret he didn't get the money from Mr. Gold. Mary Margaret tells him he was right -- she was ""just dreaming"" to think the town drunk and the town harlot could do anything.

In Fairy Tale Land, Dreamy tries to make a quiet exit to meet with Nova, but the rest of the dwarves wake up and ask why he's leaving. He tells her he's meeting Nova and he's in love. Happy offers him a pick axe, but Dreamy doesn't take it. The dwarves hug him and seem to wish him well.

On his way out, he's stopped by the dwarf boss who tells him he can't leave. He says Dwarves aren't capable of love. Then, the other fairy shows up to reiterate to Dreamy what he's feeling is not love, ""it's just a dream."" She introduces herself as Nova's teacher. She says Nova will lose her wings if she and Dreamy run away together. She tells him to return to the mines and the dust he makes and Nova spreading it will bring ""untold joy to the world."" She tells him Nova will be a great fairy ""if you let her -- the choice is yours.""

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret tells Leroy he can never have a relationship with Sister Astrid. He brushes this off, saying Astrid was the first person who told him he could do anything, and he didn't want to disappoint her. Mary Margaret tells him there are consequences to following through when the world doesn't want you to. He asks her about her good memories with David and whether she regrets them. She no no, and Leroy says life is all about holding on to good memories. He says all he wanted was a moment with Astrid to give him hope ""that any dream's possible."" He tells Mary Margaret she's had that, ""so stop feeling sorry for yourself and enjoy it -- because I am."" Mary Margaret says if she had the dream it wasn't worth it. He tells her sitting there drinking won't end her pain, and he can't only think of one thing that will.

We next see Leroy on a roof above the Miners Day carnival. He isn't going to jump, he's going get his moment. He knocks out the transformer, cutting all the power to the whole town. Mary Margaret asks what he's doing, and he says, ""I'm selling candles, sister.""

In Fairy Tale Land, we see Nova waiting for Dreamy and he arrives. She hands him a telescope and he sees a boat waiting for them. She says it has everything they need to explore the world, but Dreamy sadly tells her he can't go with her. He tells her he's a dwarf and he belongs in the mines, and she belongs with the other fairies. She tells him he's special, but he questions what makes them different from any other dwarf and fairy. She says their love makes them different. She knows he talked to the blue fairy. He says it doesn't matter what the blue fairy said. She tells him she loves him, and asks, ""Don't you love me?""

""I'm a dwarf,"" he says. ""I can't love.""

Dreamy goes back to the mines and asks where his axe is. He gets it and it doesn't work. He slams it until it breaks. He asks the boss to hand him another axe. He gets it and the name reads ""Grumpy."" He gets back to work.

In Storybrooke, Leroy and Mary Margaret have sold out of candles and Leroy is ecstatic. Leroy looks over and sees Astrid, and Mary Margaret tells him to go deliver the news and get his moment.

Leroy brings her the cash box with $5,000. She says she doesn't know what to say, and he says, ""You're welcome."" He tells her he's going to fix up his boat and she can be his first passenger. She says she'd love that.

Emma is looking at Kathryn's phone records with the 8-minute call with David highlighted. Regina shows up and asks for an update on Kathryn's case. Emma says she's found something but she isn't yet sure what it means, and at this point in the investigation she doesn't want to reveal what she's found. Regina tells Emma if she's covering for someone and not doing her job, she'll find someone who will.

Mary Margaret smiles as she puts up a ""sold out"" sign on the candle stand. She gets back to her car and sees the word ""Tramp"" scrawled on the windows. She walks away and a kind older lady relights Mary Margaret's candle with her own.

Emma finds David at the carnival and tells him he needs to come to the Sheriff's station and tell him everything.

""I thought I already did,"" he says.

""So did I,"" she says, and she puts him in the back of the Sheriff's car while some of the carnival attendees watch."

He can't explain the phone call that shows up on his records. Emma still doesn't think he's lying, but points out he's not in a great spot. She lets him go, but suggests he get a lawyer.

At Granny's, Ruby flirts with August (Eion Bailey), asking him about his travels. Granny (Beverley Elliott) calls for her, but Ruby blows her off. ""Ruby, stop flirting and get over here,"" Granny commands.

In fairyland, Ruby/Red opens the shutters to her cottage for a young suitor named Peter. He wants her to run away with him, but she's afraid to cross Granny.

Red says good-bye to her suitor and answers Granny's calls. There's a hunting party at the front door preparing to set off after the wolf that's been killing sheep. Red is going stir crazy. Granny won't let her go out with the wolf on the prowl. And she has to keep her hood on -- Granny says red repels wolves.

Granny and Red barricade up the cottage. Red heads to bed as Granny mans the front door with a crossbow.

Back in the diner, Ruby is mad at Granny for embarrassing her. Granny wants her to work Saturdays and she wants to train her how to do the books. Ruby objects. Granny tells her she dresses like a drag queen during fleet week. ""And you dress like Norman Bates when he dresses like Norman Bates' mother,"" Ruby shoots back.

Granny tells her it's time she grows up, and reminds her as long as she works there she has to listen to her rules. They start arguing. Ruby quits and walks out.

Back in Fairyland, in the morning they open up the cottage and Ruby gathers eggs from the chickens in the coop. She hears something hiding. It's Snow White.

They head to the well. Ruby tells her about the killer wolf. They see its handiwork: the hunting party has been slaughtered.

Back in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret asks Emma about David. Emma prepares MM for the fact people are going to look suspiciously at her and David about Katherine's disappearance.

They come upon Dr. Whale (David Anders) hitting on Ruby, who has her bags packed and is waiting at the bus stop. He scampers off. Ruby tells them about her fight with Granny and she's leaving, but she's not sure for where. MM invites her home with them.

In Fairyland, at a town meeting, the leader of the hunting party regrets he couldn't save his men. Red and Snow, with her face hidden, are at the meeting. So is Peter. Granny tells a story about when she was a young girl and her six older brothers and father went out to kill the wolf. She climbed up on the roof and watched as the wolf slaughtered them all. She fell off the roof and the wolf came over, chomped on her arm and then left her alone.

She shows off the gnarly scar. She warns everyone the wolf cannot be beaten. She urges everyone to hide.

Back at the cottage, Ruby tells Snow about her crush on Peter. Snow thinks Granny is using the threat of the wolf to keep Red from love. Red thinks about it for a minute and then announces they should go kill the wolf.

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret drives to the edge of town and gets out to look around where Katherine disappeared. She hears something and follows the noise and runs in to David. She assures him Emma knows he had nothing to do with Katherine disappearing. David is in a daze and just keeps saying he's looking. He stumbles off.

Red and Snow trek through the woods, tracking. They find wolf prints.

In Storybrooke, Henry helps Ruby look through help wanted ads at the sheriff's station. Ruby notices the phone keeps ringing. Henry explains it goes to a machine when Emma is busy. Ruby answers it and takes a message, then she handles a call about a prowler, explaining it's a neighbor's dog.

Emma sees her on the phones and offers her a job. Ruby goes out on a lunch run.

Mary Margaret comes and tells Emma about running into David in the woods. ""It's like he was a different person,"" she says.

In Fairyland, Snow and Red keep following the tracks and find the paw prints turn into boots, like he was a wolf that turned into a man.

Red knows ""wolf's time"" is once a month on the full moon. They keep following the tracks and realize they're at Red's cottage. The prints go to her window -- where Peter was.

Red knows Peter didn't join the hunting party last night, but she worries about what will happen tonight.

Snow tells Red to tell him.

Ruby goes in to Granny's and orders lunch, bragging that she's working at the sheriff's station now and helping solve crimes.

Back in Fairyland, Red tells Peter she thinks he's the wolf. He doesn't understand how he could not remember. He suggests she chain him up, just in case.

At the sheriff's station, Henry suggests Emma let Ruby do more because she doesn't remember she's Little Red Riding Hood and has forgotten she's a bada--.

Emma tells Ruby to come with her. They head into the woods looking for David. All of a sudden, Ruby says she hears him and realizes where David is. She finds him passed out on the ground with bump on his head. He doesn't remember anything since he was in Emma's office last night.

Emma takes him to see Dr. Whale, who says it seems like what happened to him when he came out of his coma. Emma wonders what else he could do in that state and not remember. David suddenly worries he could have done something to Katherine. Regina storms in -- she's still David's emergency contact since Katherine is missing. She snarks at Emma to just find Katherine.

Emma calls Ruby and asks her to drive to the toll bridge -- where David went last time during a black out. Emma wants her there before David is released from the hospital.

Ruby drives to the bridge and finds some recently dug up ground. She digs and finds a small wooden box. She opens it and screams.

Back in the cottage, Snow lies in bed, taking Red's place. Granny finds her. Snow explains Red's out with Peter and isn't in danger because he's tied up. ""She's got him tied up? Oh that poor boy,"" Granny says.

Cut to Peter chained to a tree, yelling at Red to stop. She's the wolf.

Back at the station, Emma looks in the box. Ruby asks if it's what she thinks it is. It is.

Ruby's freaked out, but Emma tells her she did a great job finding David and then the box. Emma's impressed.

Granny and Snow head out in the woods to find Red. Granny knew. Red's mother was one, too, but was killed by a hunting party. Red starting turning when she was 13. Granny paid a wizard for the cloak, but Red doesn't always wear it.

The story she told was about Red's grandfather. He marked her that night, then came back and turned her. She says it's mostly faded away, but she's tracking Red by smell. They hear a wolf braying. Granny approaches with the crossbow. They come upon the wolf tearing into Peter.

The wolf turns and lunges at them. Granny shoots her with the arrow. Snow throws the cloak over Red and she turns back. Red is confused. The hunting party is approaching. She turns and sees Peter's body. Snow tells her she's the wolf. Red is distraught as the hunting party appears in the distance, Snow helps her away.

Back in the diner, Ruby visits Granny -- who has the wolf claw scars on her arm. Ruby tells her she wants to come back. She wasn't mad, she was scared of the extra responsibility. Granny assures her she's ready and can handle it. Granny tells her she wanted to learn the books so she could take over the place and own it when she retires. Granny tells Ruby she's proud of her.

Mary Margaret visits with David at the pet shelter, he's worried about what he might have done. Emma joins them. She tells them they found a box and it had a human heart inside. There were fingerprints in the box and a matchto a specific person. David tells Emma to arrest to arrest him.

But the fingerprints weren't his.

They were Mary Margaret's."

Red tells the prince to take off without her. She tells him she's giving him a head start, then, as he rides away, she turns into a wolf and jumps right toward the pack of knights who were chasing them. As he rides away, we catch a glimpse of a ""Wanted"" sign featuring Snow White's face, reading that she's wanted for murder and treason.

Back in Storybrooke, Emma is taking Mary Margaret's mug shots at the sheriff's office. She still doesn't believe Mary Margaret killed Kathryn, but she ""has to go where the evidence leads."" Mary Magaret says it's insane that the evidence shows she cut out Kathryn's heart and buried it. Emma says that if she shows Mary Margaret any favortism, Regina will have her fired and replace her with someone who will railroad Mary Margaret.

In Fairy Tale Land, we see a Snow White who isn't quite so whimsical as we've always thought. She sings to a blue bird until it comes close enough for her to take a swing at it with a broom. When Grumpy asks her what she's doing, she says, ""Getting rid of the vermin in this house."" She doesn't want to eat, but Grumpy tells her he and the dwarves ""made something extra special tonight."" She shows up in the dining area and Jiminy Cricket is there to tell her that her friends have something to tell her. They say she's ""changed."" She hasn't been very nice to any of them, and even Happy is telling her how horrible she's been. Grumpy tells her the potion she drank changed her. She insists the potion was the solution, not the problem. She says the problem is that she's living with dwarves instead of in her palace with her father, as a princess. She's angry at the queen. Jiminy says that's understandable, but it isn't fair of her to take it out on her friends. Snow says he's right, and that she ""should be taking it out on her."" She sets out to get revenge, despite everyone asking her not to. She says she's going ""to kill the queen.""

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret shows up in an interview room and finds Regina there as a third-party witness to ensure Emma stays impartial. Emma proceeds with questioning that reveals David and Mary Margaret's affair. Emma shows Mary Margaret her own jewelry box, which is what they found the heart in. Mary Margaret insists it must have been stolen. Regina claims to empathize, telling her she knows what it's like to lose someone you love -- and that it changes someone. Emma pulls Regina outside and reminds Regina that she (Emma) was supposed to do the questioning. Regina asks Emma how she's so sure Mary Margaret didn't do it. She says there'd be signs of a break-in if the jewelry box had been stolen, and reiterates to Emma that Mary Margaret had her heart broken, which can make people do ""unspeakable things.""

Back in Fairy Tale Land, we see Snow on her quest for revenge. She sets up a trap to knock a knight of his horse and interrogates him (pretty violently) for information on the queen's whereabouts. He tells her she's in her castle, but will be leaving in the morning for the summer palace. She tells him the summer palace was built for her mother, and knocks him out with the back of her pick-axe. Grumpy finds her taking the knight's armor and asks her what she's doing. She says she's going to do whatever she has to do to get into the castle. He says he's there to help her. He's going to take her back to Rumplestiltskin so he can reserve the memory-altering affects of the potion. Grumpy tells Snow that Rumple ""can do anything."" This gets her attention.

Emma is searching the apartment for signs of a break-in, when Henry shows up to see how he can help. He says Regina has a motive. ""She hates Snow White,"" he says. Emma doubts this motive will hold up in court. They hear a noise and Emma pulls a vent off the floor to discover a knife hidden inside.

Henry is bummed and August finds him at the diner. August urges Henry to look to his book for the answers he's looking for. Henry says ""it's just a book,"" but August says they both know that's not the case. Henry's interest is piqued. August tells Henry he is also ""a believer"" and he wants ""to help others to see the light."" Emma is one of the people he's trying to help believe, and she needs proof. Henry opens up the book.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming comes across the knight who Snow White assaulted. He tells the prince about Snow White's attack, but the prince refuses to believe that Snow is ""bloodthirsty.""

David visits Regina and tells her he doesn't believe Mary Margaret could have killed Kathryn. Regina tells him ""everyone has a dark side."" David says he doesn't think Mary Margaret could do such an evil thing. Regina says she thinks ""evil isn't born, it's made."" David tells Regina she doesn't know anything about evil. David starts to wonder whether he blacked out and did it himself.

Mary Margaret tells Emma she doesn't even know where the heating vent in her room is. Emma says she still believes Mary Margaret is innocent, but suggests she get a lawyer. Mr. Gold shows up and offers his services. Emma wants him to leave, but Mary Margaret is happy for the assistance. Emma leaves and Mary Margaret tells Mr. Gold she can't pay him. He says he's not interested in money, he has a vested interest in her future.

In Fairy Tale Land, Grumpy is asking Rumple about the potion, which Rumple explains ""took away her love, left a big hole in her heart."" He says there's no potion that can bring back true love, because it's the most true magic of all. He asks Snow what she really wants, and she says she wants his help to kill the queen. He gives her a bow and arrow that always hits its target. He says she'll have to hit the queen with it when she's on her way to the summer palace. Snow asks Rumple what he wants in return and he says he's ""invested in (her) future.""

David pays a visit to Dr. Archie Hopper and asks for help remembering what happened during his blackouts.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming tracks down Rumplestiltskin. After a little discussion, Rumple tells the prince that true love's kiss will reverse the potion's affects. In return for information on Snow's whereabouts, Rumple wants the prince's cloak. He readily gives it up. Rumple warns the prince to find her quickly, because evil isn't born, it's made. The prince does track Snow down quickly and plants a kiss on her, but she punches him out.

In storybrooke, Henry shows Emma ""proof."" He shows Emma the keys Regina has to all the houses in town. He proceeds to try all the keys on the massive key ring. After a couple of failed tries, Emma agrees to try one more -- and the door opens.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming comes to and finds himself tied up. Snow still doesn't remember who he is, and she's just as determined as ever to kill the queen. He begs her not to do it as she walks away.

In storybrooke, Dr. Hopper asks David to go back to his last memory of talking to Kathryn. As David is retracing his memories, the ones from Storybrooke and Fairy Tale Land converge in his mind, and he sees a flash of who he thinks is Mary Margaret (but is actually Snow White) in the forest, and he is shouting, ""You can't kill her!"" David's eyes open and he tells Dr. Hopper, ""It was..."" He stops and runs out, telling Dr. Hopper he can't help.

In Fairy Tale Land, Jiminy Cricket finds Prince Charming and helps free him. He tells the prince that Snow can't remember who he (the prince) is until she remembers who she is. We next see Snow tracking the queen and her caravan, and preparing to shoot the arrow. She fires, and Prince Charming jumps in front of the arrow,piercing his shoulder. She asks him what he's doing, and he says he's going to show her actions rather than words. He tells her he loves her, but she says she doesn't love him. ""I don't even remember you,"" she says. He tells her he would rather die than let her fill her heart with darkness.

""You would really die for me?"" she asks. She says no one has ever done anything like this for her before.

""No one you can remember,"" he says. They kiss, and she does remember him, and her love for him. But then King George's soldiers arrive, throw a few punches, and take Prince Charming away as a prisoner. Snow shouts to him ""I will always find you.""

Back in Storybrooke, David visits Mary Margaret in the holding cell. Because his memories are confused, he thinks she wanted to kill Kathryn. He's confused, and they end up fighting. She breaks down and kicks him out.

Back in the Enchanted Forest, Snow returns to the dwarfs, upset. She gives one of the dwarfs a new mug, and apologizes to all of them. It's a happy reunion, but she has to leave again to go after James. The dwarfs agree to go with her.

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret is making up the cot, and finds a key. It fits her cell. She almost escapes, but Emma returns with breakfast. Emma tells her the DNA of the heart matches Kathryn, so she has no choice but to charge Mary Margaret with murder, though she believes Regina is framing her. Emma plans to take Regina on, but needs time to do it right. Mary Margaret agrees to give her time, then pulls out the key again.

Emma goes to visit Mr. Gold, and tells him what she thinks. She wants advice and help. She doesn't care so much about his methods, so long as it gets results. He tells her she's more powerful than she thinks she is.

In the Enchanted Forest, Rumpelstiltskin is doing something with potions and vials. He mixes Snow White's hair with one from James that he got off of James's cloak.

Back in Storybrooke, we're shown Mary Margaret's empty jail cell."

Henry's book is open to the story of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and he looks a bit confused. Emma finds Henry (Jared Gilmore) sitting in the sheriff's office. He says he wants to congratulate Emma on the genius plan -- escape. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) and Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) are surprised to see Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) is missing. Emma knows she needs to find Mary Margaret before her 8 a.m. arraignment. Mr. Gold warns Emma that Mary Margaret's future is in jeopardy and if Emma is caught helping her, her own future is jeopardized, as well. She doesn't care.

Emma is driving in a dense fog and nearly hits a pedestrian near the woods. She stops to make sure he's OK, and he's limping after taking a fall to avoid getting hit. She insists on driving him somewhere. He introduces himself as Jefferson (Sebastian Stan), and gets in the car.

In Fairy Tale Land, we see this same man running away in the woods. But his daughter Grace soon finds him. They're playing hide-and-seek before looking for mushrooms to sell at the market. They get home and find the Queen and her carriage waiting outside their house. The man tells his daughter to sit tight while he goes to find out what's happening. She runs into the woods while he goes toward the house.

Inside, the Queen (looking every bit ""Queen""-like) is waiting and she calls him Jefferson. He calls her Regina (Lana Parrilla). This is weird. She says she has a job for him. He doesn't want his daughter to lose her father, having already lost her mother. Regina/The Queen insists if he does this one last favor for her, she can get him and his daughter the life they've always wanted. She says she needs his skills to get her somewhere. She hands him a slip of paper. He asks what she could possibly want there. She says something of hers was taken and found its way over there, and she wants it back. He tells her to find someone else to get it. She claims she understands, and adds, ""there's nothing more important than family.""

In Storybrooke, Emma drives Jefferson to a huge house. She thinks he must have a huge family, but he says it's just him. She goes inside with him. He gives her some tea and shows her a map of the town he's been working on. Soon after drinking the tea, she begins to feel dizzy. She notices as she's staggering onto the couch his limp is gone. He says, ""Oh, I guess you caught me.""

""Who are you?"" she asks, just before losing consciousness.

In Fairy Tale Land, we see Grace and her father at the market. She finds a stuffed rabbit and asks her father to buy it. He's just short of enough money and the seller refuses to take what he has. Grace kindly tells her father she doesn't need it, and he walks away frustrated. We see the seller was really the Queen in an old woman's disguise.

In Storybrooke, Emma wakes up bound and gagged. She smashes the tea cup to use the broken pieces in order to cut herself free. She finds a telescope at the window pointed directly at the sheriff's office, and is puzzled to see the door to her office is open. She follows noises of a blade being sharpened and opens a door to see Jefferson sharpening a pair of scissors.

In Fairy Tale Land, we see Jefferson using scissors to finish making a makeshift rabbit for his daughter. She thanks him and continues her tea party with her stuffed animals. Jefferson tells his daughter he's going to be gone for the rest of the day and is sending her to the neighbor's house. She asks him not to do whatever the Queen wanted him to do. He says she wants her to have what she needs, but she says all she wants is him. She makes him promise he'll come back for their tea party. He says he wouldn't miss it for the world. She goes.

After Grace leaves, Jefferson opens a chest and pulls out a leather case and places it in the middle of the floor.

In Storybrooke, Emma sneaks down the hall and after a wooden plank in the floor squeaks, she sneaks into the next door she sees. In that room, she finds Mary Margaret bound to a chair and gagged, crying.

Emma frees her. Mary Margaret tells her a man grabbed her in the woods and brought her there. She also tells Emma she found a key under the pillow in her cell. She doesn't know who put it there, and neither does Emma. But they both want to know. Emma sneaks them out of the room. Jefferson finds them. He knows Emma doesn't want anyone to find out what she's up to, and he forces Emma to tie Mary Margaret back up. She does. Jefferson tells Emma he now needs her to do something.

In Fairy Tale Land, Jefferson pays a visit to the Queen. He's holding the box. He asks for a guarantee. If he does what she wants, his daughter will want for nothing. The Queen tells him he has her word. He pulls a hat out of the box, puts it on the floor and spins it. A purple cloud swirls around it and it forms a cyclone in the middle of the room. Jefferson and the Queen jump into the middle of it together.

Jefferson takes Emma into a room full of hats on shelves. He says he's trying to save Mary Margaret's life, and he mentions the curse keeping everyone in Storybrooke -- except Emma. She asks if he's been reading Henry's book, and he mocks her for ignoring the stories in it. He says that if she knew what he knows, she wouldn't ignore them. She asks him why he's been spying on her, and he says for the last 28 years he's been stuck in the house day after day until she came into town and the clock ticked and things started to change.

""I know what you refuse to acknowledge,"" he tells her. She's special, and brought ""magic"" to Storybrooke. She tells him he's insane. He tells her she's probably the one who's insane because she refuses to see what's in front of her. He tells her he wants her ""to get it to work."" He sits her down and faces her toward his hat.

In Fairy Tale Land, the Queen and Jefferson are at ""the entrance."" He tells her they have to stick together because the same amount of people that go in must come out. They step into Wonderland. Jefferson says he hates it.

In Storybrooke, Jefferson tells Emma to make a hat. She pieces together the hat, the tea and the insane behavior. She knows he thinks he's the Mad Hatter. He says his name is Jefferson. She tells him the stories aren't real. He tells her that her world is no more real than his. He tells her there are ""infinite more"" worlds out there. All of them have their own rules -- some have magic, some don't. And some need magic, ""like this one -- and that's where you come in."" He tells her she and Mary Margaret aren't going anywhere until Emma makes his hat and gets it to work.

""And then what?"" she asks.

""Then I can go home,"" he says.

In Fairy Tale Land, Jefferson and the Queen get to a series of arches at the beginning of the land belonging to the Queen of Hearts. The Queen pressures him to move forward. She gets to a vault with a wall full of boxes. She takes one but some knights catch them as they try to make their escape. They get close to the looking glass, which is their escape route, but the Queen stops and breaks off a piece of a mushroom. She opens the box and puts the piece inside the box. A massive purple cloud emerges and her father emerges.

The Queen explains the Queen of Hearts has always considered her a threat, so she wanted leverage -- and so she took the Queen's father. The Queen is now taking him back. Jefferson realizes he'll be stuck there if the Queen leaves with her father -- because only the same number of people who came in are allowed to go out. The Queen reminds Jefferson one should never abandon family. Jefferson is distraught, realizing he won't return to his daughter. The Queen tells him if he really cared for his daughter he wouldn't have left her in the first place.

The Queen and her father leave, and knights come to take Jefferson back to the Queen of Hearts.

The Queen of Hearts, giving questions through a knight, wants to know how Jefferson got to Wonderland. He says with his hat.

""Off with his head,"" she orders, and a knight slices Jefferson's head clean off -- but he's surprised to still be alive and talking, while a knight is holding his head up the hair. The knight tells Jefferson since Regina took his hat, he should make another one that works.

In Storybrooke, Emma is trying to do just that. Jefferson tells her -- like everyone else there -- what he loves most has been ripped from him. He asks her to take a look through another telescope. It's pointed at another house where his daughter is living as Paige with another family. Emma asks why he doesn't say something to her, and he says he doesn't want to inflict his curse on his daughter -- the curse of knowledge of their real life.

Emma starts to cry and tells him she knows what it's like to be separated from his kid. She says it can make you feel like you're losing your mind. He says it's real, and Emma agrees maybe it is. He asks if she believes.

""If what you're saying is true, that woman in the other room is my mother,"" she says, adding she wants more than anything to believe that's true. She agrees maybe she needs to open her mind up to magic.

He lets his guard down after she says she'll try to get his hat to work. Jefferson turns back and she uses the telescope to take a swing and knock him out. She runs to free Mary Margaret. Jefferson catches up and a scuffle ensues. At one point, we and Emma catch a long look at the scar on Jefferson's neck from when the knight sliced it off. He finally grabs his gun and has a clean shot at Emma, but Mary Margaret hits him from behind with a croquet mallet, and kicks him through a window, from which he falls several floors to the ground.

Emma is stunned and they look out the window to find only the hat on the ground, with no trace of Jefferson.

Outside, Emma and Mary Margaret see no sign of Jefferson. Mary Margaret also has no idea where her sudden close-combat skills came from. Emma finds her car covered with a tarp, and the keys are on the driver's seat. Emma gives the keys to Mary Margaret, telling her she has the choice of whether to run or face the charges against her and trust Emma things will turn out well. Emma asks Mary Margaret if she'd rather face this together than alone. Mary Margaret gives back the keys.

The church bells ring and Emma remembers the 8 a.m. arraignment. We next see Regina pulling up to the Sheriff's office and Emma's yellow car isn't in the Sheriff's spot. Regina looks quite pleased as she walks in, but she's stunned inside when she sees Mary Margaret sitting in her cell reading a newspaper. Mr. Gold tells Regina his client is not having any visitors.

Regina walks out and Mr. Gold follows. In the hallway, Mr. Gold explains to Regina that Mary Margaret ""came back.""

""You said this would work,"" Regina says. ""That she'd take the key, that she'd go.""

Mr. Gold says she did, ""but it seems that Ms. Swan is rather more resourceful than we thought.""

He tells Regina not to worry, because Mary Margaret is still guilty of murder. ""You may yet get what you want,"" he says.

Regina tells him the only reason she made a deal with him is because she wanted results. He assures her she'll have them, adding, ""See you at the arraignment."" She leaves.

Emma finds Henry at school and tells him she found Mary Margaret and she's OK, ""other than being on trial for murder."" Paige comes by and says hi. As she walks away, Emma asks Henry for his story book. She's curious about something.

She flips through the pages and sees the pictures of Jefferson with his daughter Grace, and his hat, and the slice on his neck.

We see a flash of Jefferson, surrounded by hats he has made, going insane trying to make a hat that works.

Henry goes back into school. Emma asks if she can keep the book for a while. Henry lets her hang onto it, and runs inside. Emma looks more closely at the book."

Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) catches her, asking, ""Remembrance of things past?""

We see this meeting happened a week earlier, with Mr. Gold asking Regina for a favor in exchange for help with (her) Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) problem. It was Mr. Gold's suggestion to stage Kathryn's death and frame Mary Margaret for the murder. The plan included leaving a key to the jail cell for Mary Margaret to use for her escape, and, as Mr. Gold says, ""We all know what happens when people try to leave Storybrooke.""

In Fairy Tale Land, we see a younger version of Regina earning praise from her father for riding her horse. Her mother disapproves, though, saying the girl is becoming an ""old maid."" Regina asks Cora why she always has to criticize her, but her mother says she's trying to help. When Regina tries to walk away, Cora (Barbara Hershey) casts a spell to suspend her in the air until she promises to ""be good.""

Regina runs away to the stable and meets with Daniel, the stable boy, and they kiss.

It's today again in Storybrooke and David (Josh Dallas) is concerned for Mary Margaret, asking Emma about the situation. He still doesn't think Mary Margaret is guilty. Emma tells him Mary Margaret doesn't want visitors. When David asks what Mary Margaret needs, Emma says, ""A miracle.""

Mary Margaret wakes up startled in her jail cell. Regina is watching her. Regina offers Mary Margaret the chance to confess and spare the town and herself a trial. Mary Margaret asks Regina what she ever did to her to make her hate her so much.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Regina meets up with Daniel but can't stay long. Regina tells Daniel she can't be with him because of her mother, who thinks one's trajectory should always move upward. Regina sees a girl on the back of a horse out of control. The girl is screaming for help. Regina gets on her horse to chase the wild one down. She pulls the young girl to safety and when the girl says she'll never ride a horse again, Regina gives her a pep talk. The young girl then introduces herself as Snow White. They hug.

Mr. Gold wants Mary Margaret to kiss up to the District Attorney. Sidney (Giancarlo Esposito) interrupts, bringing a vase of flowers to Emma's office and reporting that he hasn't been able to find anything, but he vows he won't stop until he does find something. When Emma comes back to Mary Margaret and Mr. Gold, Mary Margaret has decided she will talk to the D.A. The D.A. walks in, introducing himself as Mr. Spencer -- it's King George from Fairy Tale Land.

Mr. Spencer grills Mary Margaret until she finally says, ""Yes, of course I wanted her gone. She was the only thing keeping us apart, so, yeah, I wanted her gone -- is that what you wanted to hear?""

In Fairy Tale Land, Regina has her horse-riding clothes out when her mother casts a spell to change her into a gown. The king -- Snow White's father -- is visiting. He's there to thank Regina for saving his daughter's life. The king explains Snow's mother passed away years ago. He says he's scoured the land for a wife and has yet to find a woman with an interest in his daughter until now. He proposes. Regina's mother says, ""Yes.""

Regina flees and finds Daniel and asks him to marry her. She tearfully explains to him the king's proposal and her mother's acceptance, and says the only way out is to run. Daniel slips a ring on Regina's finger and they kiss. Snow White catches them kissing. She asks Regina what she's doing with the stable boy, but before Regina explains, Snow White runs away.

Regina chases down Snow and explains to her while the king is a kind man, she doesn't love him. Regina tells young Snow love is a kind of magic that creates happiness. After hearing this, Snow insists Regina must marry the stable boy if tha'ts who she really loves. Snow wants to tell the king the good news, but Regina tells her no one can know. She asks Snow to keep it a secret. Snow says she thinks she can. She promises, especially, never to tell Regina's mother.

In Storybrooke, August (Eion Bailey) finds Emma (Jennifer Morrison) reading Henry's book, but she says she's grasping at straws. August suggests Emma re-examine what shes already done to see if her perspective changes. Emma gets up to go to the scene of the crime. August insists on coming with her.

Near the bridge, Emma finds a shard of a shovel she thinks might fill in the missing piece to explain who really buried Kathryn's heart.

Henry (Jared Gilmore) helps Emma and August break into Regina's house by giving them a heads up over the walkie-talkie when Regina goes to take a shower. Emma and August look in the garage through Regina's tools and find the shovel with a missing piece that matches the shard Emma found exactly.

Snow and Regina's mother talk in Fairy Tale Land. Regina's mother asks Snow why Regina pulled away from her. She says she loves Regina so much but Regina doesn't let her help. Regina's mother says she'd do anything to show Regina her happiness is all that matters. Snow weighs this and then tells Regina's mother not to let Regina get married to the king because she really loves someone else.

In Storybrooke,Emma shows up at Regina's house with a search warrant and asks her to open the garage. Emma strides into the garage and sees a perfectly unbroken shovel. Emma asks Regina where the shovel went, and how she knew Emma was coming. Regina tells Emma that Mary Margaret is going to pay for what she's done.

Emma goes to August's house because she thinks he told Regina about the shovel, but he swears he didn't. Emma doesn't entirely believe him.

Regina visits Mary Margaret in her jail cell and rubs in how much she's looking forward to the trial. Mary Margaret gets upset and cries and begs Regina to forgive her for whatever she did to make her so angry at her. She cries, ""I don't deserve this, I didn't do it."" Regina replies, ""I know, but you do deserve this.""

In Fairy Tale Land, Regina's mother stops Regina and Daniel's escape, and casts a spell on them to lock them in the stable. Regina asks her mother to listen to her, and says she wants to be with Daniel. Cora doesn't want her to be the wife of a stable boy. Regina vows her mother's magic can't keep her apart from Daniel. Regina tells her mother she'll have to keep them there in the stable forever to stop them from escaping.

Cora acts as if she's OK with it, and says, ""Who am I to stop you?"" Regina hugs her mother and Regina's mother pulls Daniel aside and compassionately offers him advice about a parent always doing whats best for their child. Daniel agrees and says that's what she's doing for Regina. Regina's mother agrees and promptly rips Daniel's heart out of his chest, and turns it into ash. Regina is stunned and cries over Daniels body while her mother tells her this is her ""happy ending.""

""Love is weakness, Regina,"" her mother says. She adds pure power endures and says once she has real power, she won't have to rely on anyone to get what she wants. Her mother tells her to wipe away her tears because she's going to be Queen.

Snow sees Regina in her wedding dress and says she looks beautiful. Snow thinks Regina is about to marry Daniel because her mother would do anything for Regina's happiness. When Regina realizes this, she's speechless and nearly falls over. She pulls Snow aside and asks if Snow told her mother about Regina and Daniel. Snow apologizes for breaking the promise and says, ""I just didn't want you to lose your mother the way I lost mine.""

Regina suddenly shifts from sadness to wild-eyed vengeance. She tells Snow what she had with Daniel was infatuation and he has gone away. She's going to marry Snow's father and be Snow's stepmother, and she's going to be so happy. Cora tells Regina she's proud of how she's already adjusting. Regina winds up asking her mother if the horse with Snow on it went wild on its own. Her mother claims to know nothing about it. Regina walks away and says, ""I should've let her die on that horse.""

In Storybrooke, Regina clutches her ring and says, ""We got her, Daniel. We got her."" Mary Margaret is escorted from her jail cell. Emma confronts Mr. Gold about how he swore he could defend Mary Margaret. He insists there's still time for her to work some magic. Emma goes into her office, grabs a vase and hurls it at the wall in anger. In the pieces, she finds what looks to be a bug.

Emma goes to August to apologize for doubting him. She shows him the bug, which was from Sidney, who'd delivered the vase days earlier.

They hear a scream from behind the diner and run back to find Ruby, in shock, saying, ""She's in the alley.""

Emma goes back behind the diner and sees a body on the ground. She turns it over and it's Kathryn -- alive."

With Gold (Robert Carlyle) distracted, August creeps in the back door and heads for the back. Gold finds him. August says he's looking for maps.

Emma (Jennifer Morrison) visits Kathryn in the hospital. She remembers being in a car accident and waking up in a basement with food and water. Dr. Whale (David Anders) says she was drugged. She remembers waking up a field and going into town. Emma thinks someone was trying to frame Mary Margaret. They're looking into who faked the DNA results. Kathryn can't fathom who would do such a thing.

Regina (Lana Parrilla) accuses Gold of breaking their deal. He assures her he's broken one deal in his life and it wasn't this one. ""Kathryn was supposed to die and Mary Margaret was to get the blame!"" Regina says.

Gold thinks murder seems so much worse here. Gold reminds her Regina didn't say ""kill her"", she said ""something tragic"" and abduction qualifies. He ends the argument with a please.

Regina realizes there will be questions about the fake DNA test results and key in her cell. She doesn't understand why he'd turn on her now, since he's the one who created the curse for her in the first place.

In Fairy Tale land, a boy runs in front of a cart after his ball and the merchant yells but stops when he realizes who the boy is. It's Rumplestiltskin's son. He assures his father he's fine, but when Rump sees the cut on his son's leg he turns the man into a snail over Baelfire's objections. He stomps on the snail as his son cries no.

In the hospital, David (Josh Dallas) visits Kathryn. He apologizes for everything, but she's extremely understanding, saying what they had just wasn't right for him.

Emma hosts a welcome home party for MM. Henry conspires with August, asking if he found what he was looking for at Gold's. August has a feeling it'll find him.

Henry gives MM his present -- a giant card from the class that says ""We're so glad you didn't kill Mrs. Nolan!"" Emma goes to take Henry home, but runs into David at the door. MM isn't ready to see him yet, so Emma suggests he take Henry home to get rid of him.

Emma confronts Gold, asking if he's the one who made Kathryn materialize. ""Are you proposing I'm working with Regina, or against her?"" Gold asks. ""I don't know, maybe diagonally,"" Emma says.

Gold asks her about August. ""He's a writer; a typewriter wrapped in an enigma wrapped in stubble,"" Emma says. Gold thinks August Booth is a fake name and tells her about him poking around his shop. Emma trusts August a lot more than she trusts Gold.

Fairy Tale land Rumplestiltskin brings his son home and starts to heal his knee with magic, but his son doesn't want magic. Baelfire (Dylan Schmid) tells his dad he's different now.

Rumple points out he's brokered an ogre truce and saved lives. But Baelfire wants him to try to get rid of his power. The only way Rumple knows of is if someone stabs him with the Rumplestiltskin knife.

Baelfire asks if his dad would go along with getting rid of his magic if he found a way that didn't involve dying. Rumple says all he wants is his happiness and agrees. Bael makes them shake on it. The deal is struck.

Storybrooke

Rumple breaks into August's room and pokes around. He soon finds a drawing of the Rumplestiltskin knife.

Emma joins Sidney (Giancarlo Esposito) at the diner, confronting him with the bug he planted. Emma tells him there's a DNA trail in a basement somewhere and she's going to find it and he and Regina will be in a lot of trouble. Sidney defends her as an ""amazing woman"" and Emma realizes he's in love with Regina. Emma warns him he's going to end up going down with Regina, too.

Mr. Gold follows August through town.

Fairy Tale land

Rumple leaves Bael to play with local children, but they're all afraid of him. A girl named Morraine joins him. He tells her about trying to find a way to get rid of his dad's power. She tells him about the original being that roams the night which is more powerful than his father.

Rumplestiltskin returns and Bael sees blood on his shoes. His dad announces they need a new maid. She heard them talking about the knife. He doesn't care she was mute and couldn't tell anyone. Bael is horrified.

Storybrooke Mr. Gold sees August talking to Mother Superior (Keegan Connor Tracy). When August leaves, he interrogates her. She says August came to town looking for his father after a long separation and he recently found him. But he hasn't spoken to him yet because it was a difficult parting.

Fairy Tale Land Bael creeps out into the woods at night, and quietly calls to the powerful one. The Blue Fairy/Mother Superior arrives, saying she can help with good magic. Bael says his father is The Dark One. She offers to send him somewhere without magic -- it's the only way for him to get his father back. She gives him a magic bean, the last known to their kind. She tells him to follow it where it leads him.

Storybrooke David meets MM on the street. He apologizes, but she tells him she'll never forget what it felt like to not have his support. He points out it was a really good frame job, but she can't get past him not believing in her. ""It's like something in this world doesn't want us together,"" she says. He tells her he loves her, but she says that just makes everything sadder.

Fairy Tale Land Bael comes home to his father, who is spinning gold. He tells him about meeting with the blue fairy. Rumplestiltskin says fairy magic doesn't mix well with what he is. Bael says they could be happy somewhere else without magic. He reminds his father about the deal he made and asks if he's backing out. Rumple says no.

Storybrooke Mr. Gold visits Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), who is willing to listen. Gold tells him he thinks he might have found his son, but he's not sure if he's only seeing what he wants to see. He thinks his son might still be very angry.

Archie assures him anger between a parent and a child is the most natural thing in the world. ""I think he might be here to kill me,"" Gold says. ""Oh well, that's not,"" Archie says.

Gold has spent his whole life trying to fix things but now he's here and doesn't know what to do. Archie tells him he just has to be honest with him.

Gold finds August at the cabin. He opens with telling August he knows who he is. ""Well, I guess all the lying can stop. Papa,"" August says.

Fairy Tale Land

Bael leads his father through the forest. Rumplestiltskin asks where they're going, what kind of world it is without magic. Bael throws the bean on the ground and a whirlwind opens in the ground, like a tornado. Bael tries to convince his father to go through. Rumple says he can't. The hole gets bigger. Bael starts to slip into it.

Rumplestiltskin holds onto it, protesting he can't go. Bael calls him a coward and reminds him he promised, but Rumple won't go.

Bael slips through the hole, leaving his father behind.

When the ground closes, Rumple claws at it, saying he wants to go with him.

Storybrooke

Gold tells August he was right about him being a coward and he should have gone with him and ever since he left, he's been trying to find him.

Gold asks August to do what he's always done and be the bigger man. He breaks down crying, saying he's sorry. August hugs him. When Gold asks if he can truly forgive him, August says yes.

Gold guesses August was looking for the knife. He thought if his dad still had it, it would mean he hadn't changed. Gold suggests they go look for it.

August digs. Gold explains he buried it shortly after Emma came to town. He didn't want to take the chance of Regina finding it.

They dig it up. Gold gives it to August, telling him to destroy it. He tells August he chose the knife once, but this time he's choosing his son. Gold hands it over to August.

August takes it but then points it at Gold, saying ""I command thee, dark one!"" Gold realizes he's trying to control him. ""You're not my son,"" Gold says.

Gold tells him his son would know the knife can't harness magic in this world because there isn't any. That's why he chose this world, because there isn't any magic.

Gold takes the knife back, guessing August is from Fairy Tale Land. He wants to know how August knew about him and the knife and why he took the risk of messing with him.

August says he's sick and he needs magic. Gold leaves him.

Fairy Tale Land

Rumplestiltskin summons the blue fairy. She tells him there are no other beans to transport him. He guesses a curse might work. She says it would come at a great price and mean sacrificing this world. Rumplestiltskin swears he'll do nothing but work to get his son back.

Storybrooke Emma comes to the sheriff's office and finds Regina waiting for her. She introduces Sidney and prompts him to repeat what he just told her. Sidney confesses to everything, saying he did it so he could rescue her and be a hero and get a book deal. Emma doesn't believe him for a second.

In the hallway, Emma tells Regina it's the biggest load of crap she's ever heard. Emma warns Regina she's about to start playing a different game and all she cares about is Henry. Regina tried to take away someone she loves, so now Emma's going to take away some Regina loves. ""I am taking back my son,"" Emma says."

Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) is getting ready to go back to her teaching job after her time in jail. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) tells August and Mary Margaret she hired Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) to help build a case for taking Henry (Jared Gilmore) away from Regina. Mary Margaret asks if she's ready to be Henry's mom and Emma says yes. Henry contacts Emma on the walkie talkie and asks her to meet him at Granny's due to an emergency. Emma leaves right away. August suggests Emma take the day off and go with him to a secret location. Emma says her kid needs her. She doesn't have time.

At Granny's, Henry tells Emma someone added a new but unfinished story to the book about Pinocchio.

In Fairy Tale Land, Pinocchio and his father are on a raft in a stormy sea trying to outrun a whale. There's only one life vest and Pinocchio refuses to take it, telling his father to ""save yourself."" The father wakes up the next morning on a beach with the life vest. He finds Pinocchio dead, face down on the beach. The father picks him up and cries the he wishes he could have saved him. The Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) floats downs from the sky. ""You still can,"" she says. She waves her wand over Pinocchio and he's transformed from a puppet to a boy. He wakes up and says, ""I'm a real boy."" The father thanks the fairy. ""This is all I've ever wanted,"" he says. She tells them to go live as a family. The Blue Fairy reminds Pinocchio to be ""brave, truthful and unselfish. So long as you do that you'll always remain a real boy.""

Back in Storybrooke, August calls Mr. Gold and says they have to talk about a problem with Emma. As he's getting up to leave, he jumps back in pain and pulls up his pants leg to reveal a wooden stick where his leg should be.

Regina approaches Mary Margaret at school, explaining she's there because Henry forgot his lunch. Mary Margaret tells Regina he's with ""his mother."" Regina asks if there's something wrong with Mary Margaret who tells her ""not anymore,"" although she had been framed for murder by ""someone."" When Regina asks if she's insinuating something, Mary Margaret replies she is but she forgives her because only someone terribly lonely would try to attack other people's happiness.

""It won't make you happy,"" she tells her. As Henry walks up, Mary Margaret walks away. Regina tells him she wants to transfer him to a new class. He asks Regina if she wants him to have a new teacher because she framed Mary Margaret. When Regina asks if Henry thinks she's capable of such a thing, he replies, ""Of course. You're the evil queen."" Regina tells him the fairy tales aren't real. Henry tells her she can't stop Snow White from getting her happy ending or being with Prince Charming.

""The curse will end. Good will win,"" says Henry before insisting he won't transfer to a new class.

August enters Mr. Gold's shop to find an old man (who we recognize as Pinocchio's father) trying to sell an antique clock. August seems shocked to see the old man. The old man, who doesn't seem to recognize August, leaves and Mr. Gold asks if it's August's first time seeing ""dear old Dad since you arrived in Storybrooke?""

Mr. Gold asks why a man who says he's about to die can't say hello to his own father. August replies that is his business. Mr. Gold says August claims to be the only person who can get Emma to believe and do what she was brought to Storybrooke to do. August says Emma is slowing things down because all she can think about is getting custody of Henry. August asks Mr. Gold to steer Emma to him through his legal advice about custody. Mr. Gold says he has trouble trusting August given what he knows about his nature.

In Fairy Tale Land, Pinocchio helps his father fix a coo-coo clock. When Jiminy Cricket pops out of the clock tied up, the father asks Pinocchio if he did this and reminds him what the Blue Fairy said about being a good boy. Jiminy says Pinocchio didn't mean any harm. The Blue Fairy appears and says she has bad news. Pinocchio leaves the room with Jiminy. The Blue Fairy tells Pinocchio's father the Evil Queen has threatened the kingdom with a curse. She says there's hope if the father will help. She tells him Snow White is about to have a baby who will save everyone in the kingdom when she reaches her 28th year. Pinocchio's father asks how he can protect this child. The Blue Fairy tells him there's an enchanted tree -- like the one he carved Pinocchio from -- that can protect Snow White's child from the Queen's magic if carved into a wardrobe. Pinocchio's father says he's already lost too much to lose his boy.

Back in Storybrooke, Emma tells Mr. Gold she has to save Henry from Regina. Mr. Gold says he won't take her case because they can't prove what Regina did and she has too much power in town. Emma urges him to change his mind, but he says he's not the man to help her beat Regina. Emma leaves angry and goes to August's house. She tells him she's out of options and he once said to beat Regina she needs to see the ""big picture.""

""Show it to me,"" she says to August.

David (Josh Dallas) sees Regina struggling with her car, which she says won't start. He checks it out and says the battery is dead, and offers her a ride because she has a car full of groceries. She accepts, and calls him her ""knight in shining armor."" She invites him to stay for dinner once they get to her house. David says it's late and he has to get up early for work. He goes inside and Regina sees a note addressed to ""Mom."" We see it's blank, but she tells David the note is from Henry. He's having dinner with a friend and won't be coming home. She tells David she shouldn't be burdening him with her problems. He starts to leave, then decides to stay for dinner after all. Regina smiles that evil smile.

In Fairy Tale Land, Gepetto (Tony Amendola), Pinocchio, Jiminy (Raphael Sbarge) and the Blue Fairy find the enchanted oak tree. Gepetto says he can make a wardrobe out of it. The wardrobe has to be big enough to protect two from the Queen's curse -- Snow White and the prince -- who will step inside before the curse strikes, and travel to a distant land where Snow will give birth to her child. When the child reaches her 28th year, she'll begin the battle that will defeat the Evil Queen. Gepetto realizes once the curse strikes, Pinocchio will turn back into a puppet. The Blue Fairy says it's impossible to know for sure. Gepetto asks to give Pinocchio one of the two safe spots in the wardrobe. Jiminy tells Gepetto he can't bargain with the fate of the whole kingdom. Gepetto says Pinocchio goes into the wardrobe or no one does. He tells the Blue Fairy to tell the prince and Snow White there is only enough magic in the tree to protect one person.

At the round table, the Blue Fairy explains the magic of the tree. Gepetto confirms he can build it. She includes the one caveat, the tree can protect only one and a choice must be made.

In Storybrooke, August is taking Emma on a trip to tell her his story. And they leave Storybrooke.

David and Regina wrap up dinner, and David compliments Regina's lasagna by telling her ""you really know how to work some magic."" She and we get the irony, but he doesn't. Eventually, David asks Regina to tell him the story of how she found him. She remembers it being a cold night and it was late. She went back for her forgotten phone and saw David on the side of the road, unconscious. David thinks it's almost like the universe wanted her to find him. She moves in for a kiss, but David backs away and says ""this is great like it is.' He leaves. After David is gone, Regina angrily throws a glass at a mirror and shatters it.

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow White is in labor and the wardrobe isn't yet finished. The curse is almost upon them, The Blue Fairy tells Gepetto that Pinocchio can't go into the wardrobe. After she leaves, Gepetto tells Pinocchio to get into the wardrobe. Pinocchio resists lying, but goes along with Gepetto's plan. Gepetto makes Pinocchio promise in 28 years he will make sure the savior believes. Pinocchio gets in. Gepetto tells him, ""You will find me again, and on that day I will look at you with pride. You will be a great man, my son.""

Gepetto closes the doors, there is a rumble, and he opens the doors to find the wardrobe empty. He cries.

Outside Storybrooke, we see August driving Emma on his motorcycle. They arrive at a diner Emma recognizes. August says he was the 7-year-old boy who found Emma when she was a baby.

Pinocchio pops out of a tree in a forest, but it's clearly a different time when he sees a commercial airplane fly over him. He bumps the tree again and gets a jolt filled with flashbacks to his father and the moment he was sent away in the wardrobe. There is another jolt. Pinocchio finds a crying baby in a tree. He picks the baby up.

Outside Storybrooke, Emma tells August she's done listening to his story. But he tells her more details about the blanket she was wrapped in when he found her. He says he lied about where he found her in order to protect her. He tells her they both came into this world through the tree they're standing next to. He says the unfinished story from Henry's book, which he wrote, ends with her believing. She leaves and he gives chase, only until he falls over in pain. He explains he was in Phuket, Thailand, a beautiful place, when Emma decided to stay in Storybrooke. She asks how he knows when she decided to stay and he says he woke up at 8:15 in the morning with a shooting pain in his leg. That's 8:15 p.m. in Storybrooke, and that's when time started to move forward again in the town. He says he was supposed to be there for her and he wasn't, which was why he needed a painful reminder.

He tries to show her his wooden leg, but she can't see it. She only sees a leg. He says her denial is worse than he thought, but she says she doesn't want the fate of everyone in the town on her shoulders. She only wants Henry. He tells her she's everyone's ""only hope.""

""Then you're all screwed,"" she says before walking away.

In a flashback, we see Pinochhio making funny faces in a foster home to stop Baby Emma's crying. Another kid shows Pinocchio a wad of cash he found in a sock drawer in the house and says it's enough to buy them all bus tickets out of town. Pinocchio wants to bring Emma, but can't. He decides to go away, leaving Emma behind.

In Storybrooke, August walks up and sees the man he knows is his father working on the coo-coo clock. He gives him a tip on how to make it work and the man tries it with success. He flashes a smile and asks, ""Who taught you that?""

August says, ""My father.""

The man says August's father must be very proud. August says he doesn't think he turned out to be the man his father wanted him to be. August says he had a chance to fulfill a promise but by the time he got around to it, it might have been too late. The older man says if he had a son, he'd be proud as long as he tried to follow through and correct his mistake. August asks the man if he'd be willing to take on an assistant, and the man says he can't pay him.

""I just feel like fixing things,"" August says. The man invites him into the garage.

Henry wakes up that night to a ""code red"" on the walkie talkie from Emma. She says she needs to talk to him about them. He goes outside to talk. Emma asks if he wants to get away from Regina and live with Emma.

""More than anything,"" he says.

She tells him to buckle up because they're leaving Storybrooke. And she drives off."

Meanwhile, just as Emma and Henry reached the town limits, Henry grabs the steering wheel and stops the car, telling Emma that her ""family"" needs her in Storybrooke.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince James faces the kind and tells that losing his life for love is ""a sacrifice that I am happy to make.""

""As you wish,"" the king tells him before the knights walk him over to the guillotine and prepare to off his head. Just as the blade drops, it turns into water and in walks Regina. She wants the man the king pretends is his son and offer to pay any riches King Midas had promised for him. She wants to use the prince to get to Snow White.

In Storybrooke, Regina is upset that her apple tree is dying. She immediately goes to Mr. Gold for answers. She thinks the curse is weakening because of Emma. He mentions that Emma wants Henry and that the curse was meant to take away Snow White and Prince Charming's happiness. Giving up Henry might be the cost of keeping the curse intact. He reminds Regina, also, that the curse will be broken if she kills Emma. She wants Regina to undo the curse, but he says he couldn't even if he wanted to. She thinks he wants the curse broken and wants to know why. Mr. Gold doesn't want to discuss it. Regina wants a new deal but Mr. Gold isn't interested. She offers ""anything."" He tells her she no longer has anything he wants. He warns her that once people wake up and remember who she is and what she did to them, ""they are going to be looking for blood.""

Regina sticks a ""white rabbit"" card on Paige's bike at school.

Emma gets back home and Mary Margaret is annoyed that she'd left so abruptly. Emma apologizes and says she doesn't want to be sheriff and relying on her. She also admits that she took Henry with her. Mary Margaret tells Emma she's reverting into the person she was before she came to town. Mary Margaret tells Emma to figure out what to do with Henry.

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow White is planning her move to rescue the prince and Red brings news that the Queen is there, too. Snow is going on with the plan anyway, knowing that the Queen is trying to destroy her happiness.

Inside the castle, the Queen tells the prince she has a ""satisfying brand of punishment"" for Snow. She walks away, showing off an apple.

In Storybrooke, Regina meets with Jefferson, the Mad Hatter, and he acknowledges he got the ""message"" (the white rabbit card). She tells him she wants his help. He's none too pleased to see Regina, but she says she has a way for them to both get what they want. She shows him a hat box, which he opens. She wants him to use it again, but he says he can't make it work. She says she has some magic -- ""hopefully enough for one last journey."" She says the solution of how get rid of Emma lies back in their home land. Jefferson tells Regina that if he helps, he wants her to write him and Paige a new story, a new life in Storybrooke. She says he can have that ""after we take care of Miss Swan.""

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow gives the signal to launch the move toward the castle. They move in and Snow starts tearing up on some knights -- with a little help from Grumpy and the rest of the dwarves. Soon, they're trapped, but a swarm of fairies -- led by the Blue Fairy -- come by and knock the knights out with fairy dust.

Henry goes to August, who apologizes for having failed. August shows Henry his arm, which has now turned to wood. August explains he's changing back because he hasn't ""been a good boy."" August explains that Emma can't see his wooden appendages because she doesn't want to believe. August says he wants to spend what little time he has left with his father, Marco (in Fairy Tale Land). August tells Henry he's out of Operation: Cobra.

Emma talks to Dr. Hopper for advice, but he thinks Emma would have a difficult time making a case for custody. He tells Emma ""this war has to end.""

In the castle, Snow finds Charming locked up and makes her into his cell. But he isn't really there. He's just a mirage. The Queen took him to her palace and Snow is only seeing him through the Queen's mirror. The Queen shows up and tells Snow she wants to talk, and tells her they should meet ""where it all began."" Snow prepares for the parlay and heads off despite the dwarves' and Red's protests.

Regina leads Jefferson to the room where she keeps her magic. He puts the hat down but it doesn't spin. She gives the hat some magic, but it isn't enough. Jefferson needs ""something that still works,"" and Regina looks at her ring from Daniel. It glows with magic and she reluctantly gives it up. The hat immediately begins to spin but not enough to open a portal. Jefferson says there might be enough magic to reach to the other side and retrieve. Regina has an idea. He tells her to ""guide the hat"" to the time and place where the thing exists. She tells him they're after an apple.

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow shows up for the parlay at the barn and reminds Snow about when she ran down Snow's runaway horse and saved her life. Regina takes Snow to Daniel's grave. She tells Snow that Daniel died because of Snow. She reminds Snow of how she promised to keep her secret and that's why Daniel was killed. The Queen presents Snow with an apple that would turn Snow's own body into a tomb in which she'll live with nothing but her own regrets. She has to eat it willingly. But if she doesn't, the prince dies. Snow congratulates the Queen for winning and eats the apple. Snow crumbles to the ground while the prince wakes up in his cell shouting because he knows the Queen has done something to Snow.

The apple rolls out of Snow's limp hand and down the hill, where it falls through a hole and Jefferson catches it in Storybrooke. Regina now has what she needs and has to figure out how to get the savior to taste her ""forbidden fruit."" We next see Regina whipping up some delicious-looking, apple-based pastry.

Just then, Emma shows up and wants to talk to Regina. She goes inside and tells Regina that ""whatever"" is between them needs to end. Emma tells Regina she's leaving town, but she wants to be able to visit and spend time with Henry. They head to the kitchen and Regina gives Emma her famous turnover."" Emma looks suspicious at first, but takes it.

In Fairy Tale Land, the dwarves and Red find Snow laying lifeless on the hill. Red realizes Snow ""sacrificed herself for true love."" The Queen is watching all this, and still has the prince in his cell.

In Storybrooke, Regina boastfully visits Mr. Gold and tells him she came up with a solution by having made magic from magic. She tells Mr. Gold that he's going to be staying there, right where he belongs. She tells him that whatever there reason was he wanted the curse to be broken is ""never going to happen.""

Henry visits Emma as she's preparing to leave. He tries to stop her from leaving and tells her she's ""just scared,"" which happens to all heroes right before they fight back, he adds. She tells him he can't believe in curses. Henry tells Emma that Regina wants her dead because Emma is the only one who can stop her. Henry sees the turnover and tells Emma she can't eat it because it's poison. He takes the turnover and eats it to prove the curse is real. She is about to give him ice cream when he collapses."

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) vows he will find Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin), but he's sent off for execution. At the last moment, he takes out a couple of knights and makes a run for it. One knight shoots another with an arrow and reveals himself as ""a friend."" It's the Huntsman (Jamie Dornan). He tells the prince he doesn't know him, but he knows Snow White, and he sends Prince Charming on his way.

In Storybrooke, Henry (Jared Gilmore) is in the hospital and non-responsive. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) tells Dr. Whale (David Anders) the poisoned apple tart must have been the cause. He tells her Henry is showing now signs of neurotoxins. There is no explanation, he says. ""It's like"" he starts to say. Emma sees Henry's book of fairy tales and finishes the sentence to herself by saying, ""It's like magic.""

She picks up the book and is jolted by its stories. Regina (Lana Parrilla) appears. Emma goes off on her. ""You did this,"" Emma says before slamming Regina around for a bit. Emma tells Regina that Henry ate the apple turnover. Regina confesses the turnover was meant for Emma. Regina also admits she used the last of her magic. She doesn't know what will happen to Henry because magic in Storybrooke is unpredictable.

""So what do we do?"" Emma asks Regina, who says there's one other person in town who knows about it.

""Mr. Gold,"" Emma says.

""Actually, he goes by Rumplestiltskin,"" Regina replies.

In Fairy Tale Land, the knight who let Prince Charming go tells the Queen (Lana Parrilla) that Charming escaped. The Queen sees a vision of Charming in her mirror and says, ""He's mine."" We next see Charming confronted by Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle). He takes Charming's mother's ring and tells him it will get brighter the closer Charming gets to Snow White. Charming doesn't want to make a deal with Rumple. They engage in a sword fight but Rumple's magic makes it an uneven fight. Rumple eventually tells Charming to take the deal because they both want Charming to end up together with Snow White.

In Storybrooke, David (Josh Dallas) finds Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) and tells her he was wrong about her and them, ""about everything."" He wishes he had a good reason for not believing in her. He says his life hasn't made sense since he woke up from the coma, but he says what he's feeling for her is love. He tells her he's going to leave for Boston unless she gives him a reason to stay. She says she can't.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Rumple offers Charming a vial of ""true love."" He tells Charming the magic of true love must be protected at all costs. He asks him to put it inside the belly of the beast. Rumple says he's ""saving it for a rainy day.""

In Storybrooke, Emma and Regina visit Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) for help. He tells Emma he's bottled some true love, which is the only magic capable of reversing the curse. He says the true love magic is so powerful that when he created the dark curse, he placed a drop of it on the parchment. He saved the rest in a vial, he says, for a rainy day.

""Well, it's storming like a bitch,"" Emma says, ""where is it?""

She doesn't care about reversing the curse, just saving Henry. Mr. Gold says Emma has to go find it. Then he asks Regina if their ""friend"" is still in the basement. The magic is hidden ""in her."" Mr. Gold then reveals Emma's father's sword.

Emma visits Henry in the hospital and tells his non-responsive body he was right about the curse. She's sorry she didn't believe him. She leaves his book for when he wakes up. Regina comes in. Emma tells her to say what she's got to say because they have to meet in 10 minutes. Jefferson (Sebastian Stan) sees Regina crying over Henry. He says he's there to collect on their deal. Regina says it's null and void because Emma was meant to eat the apple. She asks Jefferson if he's going to kill her. She tells him she knows he wants to, but he doesn't have it in him.

Emma goes to August (Eion Bailey) and finds he can't open the door. He's mostly turned into wood. Emma can see it now. He tells her she has to break the curse to stop it from happening. She tells him ""no normal person"" can deal with what she's trying to figure out. He tells her she's not normal. She can ""save all of""... Before he can finish, his face turns to wood.

Regina takes Emma to the secret chamber and tells her to get into an elevator Regina has to lower her into. Regina says ""an old friend"" is down there. Emma warns Regina that if Henry dies, so does Regina.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, we see Charming's first encounter with the beast -- a not-particularly-fearsome-looking woman (aka Maleficient (Kristin Bauer) who had some serious magical power before turning into a dragon.

In Storybrooke, we see Emma looking for the ""old friend"" and seeing the dragon.

In alternating pieces, we see Charming trying to get the true-love magic into the beast and Emma trying to get it out. At one point, Emma tosses the sword aside and tries to use her gun, which is useless.

At the hospital, Mary Margaret reads the story of Snow White to Henry. She tells Henry she gave him the book because she knows life doesn't always have a happy ending, but she thought...

Before she can finish, Henry's monitors start beeping.

Doctors and nurses rush in. We see one person walk to an exit door with a cup of tea. The person hands a receptionist the tea. She immediately slumps over. It's Jefferson. He's going to get Belle (Emilie de Ravin). He tells Belle to go find Mr. Gold and tell him Regina locked her up. ""He's going to know what to do,"" Jefferson says.

In Fairy Tale Land, Rumple is impressed with Charming's work. He hands the prince the ring and says he ""will find her"" with it. Charming takes it and thanks him. Rumple whips up some shiny new clothes for Charming, who asks Rumple why he wants Charming and Snow White together. Rumple says he's ""a fan of true love, deary; and, more importantly, what it creates.""

We next see Emma again pointlessly shooting at the dragon. She sees the sword and figures it's worth a shot. She grabs it and hurls it straight at the dragon's belly. After a loud burst, she sees the egg which contains the vial of true love.

In Fairy Tale Land, Charming's ring is glowing as he races through the forest. He finds the dwarves, who are carrying Snow's lifeless body. He stands over her and asks for a chance to say goodbye. He kisses her and the wind whips. Snow breathes again. They walk together and Snow asks Charming how he did it. He shows her the ring that led him back to her, and then he proposes with it. He asks her to marry him and she says, ""What do you think?"" They kiss, but something seems off. She says it's ""the little matter of your father and my stepmother."" She suggests they take back the kingdom. He asks how and she says, ""Together.""

In Storybrooke, David drives away.

Emma is coming up in the elevator and it jams. She looks up and sees Mr. Gold, who says Regina has abandoned her. Emma tries to climb up the rest of the way. Mr. Gold urges her to just toss the egg up to him. Henry is going to be fine. She tosses it up to him and climbs the rest of the way. By the time Emma gets to the top, she sees Regina bound with her mouth taped. Regina says Gold tricked her. They start to chase after him and both get calls from the hospital. They arrive. and Dr. Whale and nurse tell them they did everything they could.

Emma goes inside and sees a nurse taking Henry's oxygen mask off. Regina watches through a window to the room.

Mr. Gold is in his shop and opens up the egg. The vial is intact. The door opens and he hides it. Belle walks in and tells him she was told to find him. She tells him Regina locked her up. He touches her shoulder and realizes she's ""real"" and ""alive."" Belle says she was told he'd protect her. He hugs her and gets emotional, vowing to protect her. She asks if she knows him, and he says, ""No, but you will.""

At the hospital, Regina cries. Emma brushes his hair. Emma tells Henry she loves him and kisses his forehead. A jolt runs through them and Henry breathes, saying, ""I love you, too. You saved me."" Regina is amazed, as well.

The jolt runs through the rest of the town, hitting Mary Margaret, Red (Meghan Ory), Granny (Beverley Elliott), Dr. Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), and David, who hits the brakes on his truck just as he was about to leave the town. Henry realizes Emma broke the curse. One of the nurses -- who we know is the Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) -- tells Regina, ""If I were you, your majesty, I'd find a place to hide.""

Regina tells Henry that no matter what anyone tells him, she does love him. Then she runs.

David walks back through town, sees Mary Margaret and calls out, ""Snow!"" She stops and responds, ""Charming."" They meet in the middle of the street and she says, ""You found me!"" They kiss.

Regina sits in Henry's empty room and cries.

Mr. Gold and Belle are in the forest when she tells him she remembers, and tells him she loves him. They hug, and he says, ""And I love you, too."" First, though, he says there's something he must do.

He walks her to a well whose waters below are said to return the powers which one has lost. He drops the vial of true love into it, and a purple cloud emerges, spilling out of the well.

Back at the hospital, Emma asks Henry why people didn't go back if the curse is broke. Just then everyone looks outside to see a purple cloud enveloping the town. Belle asks Rumple what's happening. He says he's bringing magic back. When she asks why, he says, ""Because magic is power."""
