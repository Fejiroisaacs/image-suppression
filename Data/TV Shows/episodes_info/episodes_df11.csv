https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0505358/?ref_=ttep_ep25,,Malloy and Reed respond to repeated calls about an argument between two men and their wives over a boat they co-own. The feud escalates and ends with a fatal conclusion.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Phil Rawlins'],"['', '', '']",[],['boat'],[],"In this episode, the two officers make four trouble calls over a day and a half to the same address, to try to settle a dispute between two neighbors over a boat they co-own. Sadly, the neighbors escalate their dispute with every call, until finally one of the two men is dead.

Teaser Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed knock on a man's front door. Miles Wellman, dressed in a combination cap and sailor's shirt, answers the door.

""Did you call the police?"" Malloy asks.

""I sure did. Come in,"" says Wellman. Act One Wellman, out of the blue, tells them he wants them to arrest a man named Sid Roemer--without at first telling them whom he's talking about.

Malloy and Reed, with help from Miles' wife Agnes, get the story--well, a story--out of Wellman: the dispute is over a boat Wellman says is his. Wellman will say only that the boat is stored in Sid Roemer's garage. So Wellman goes over to unlock the boat to take it out for a weekend, and finds the padlock changed.

Agnes tells them the real hooker: Wellman owns only half of it, and Sid owns the other half. They were supposed to use it on alternate weekends--and there's been nothing but trouble ever since.

Knock, knock.

Agnes answers the door.

And a man with glasses, as soon as the door swings wide, starts shouting, ""You haven't heard my side of it!""

The man, Malloy and Reed gather, is Sidney Roemer. In the back-and-forth shouting that follows, Roemer complains that Wellman had the boat last weekend. Wellman reminds Roemer that he, Roemer had agreed Wellman could use the boat again this weekend.

Reed goes with Roemer to his own house, where Roemer tells Reed, ""I've had it up to here"" (indicating his neck) ""with that guy."" And he tells the rest of the story: Wellman had come to him with the proposal to buy the boat. ""Like he's too cheap to buy a boat himself."" Roemer, feeling exploited because Wellman seemed to be getting more use out of the boat, had changed the padlock to get Wellman to be more reasonable about his half of the ownership rights.

Malloy and Reed know they can't settle the matter; Wellman and Roemer have to do that themselves. Malloy points out it's too late to go fishing anyway, so why don't the two hash out their differences?

Next scene: nighttime. Malloy reminds Reed he needs to ""clear"" them. Reed gets on the radio: ""1-Adam-12. PM Watch. Clear.""

The dispatcher answers back: ""1-Adam-12, clear, and a call. See the woman; neighbor dispute. 1882 North Academy Drive. 1-Adam-12 handle. Code Two.""

Reed accepts the call, then realizes he recognizes the address: ""It's that Wellman place again!""

The officers arrive to find Miles Wellman trying to take the outboard motor out on a hand truck, and Sid Roemer waving a load of cash at Wellman, offering to buy Wellman out of the boat.

This time Sid tells the story: Sid and Wendy Roemer were going out, when Sid decided to unlock the boat. Out of nowhere came Miles, who grabbed the padlock away from him. Miles then went over to get his car, and to hitch the boat trailer to it, to move the boat out. Sid then let the air out of the trailer's tires, so Miles couldn't move the trailer. Miles kept pulling, however, and chewed up the tires. Sid then grabbed a wrench and smashed Miles' windshield--except Sid, not looking whose car he was smashing, smashed the windshield of his own car! Miles, meanwhile, gave up trying to pull the boat out and started taking the boat's tackle out, starting with the outboard motor. That's when Sid had grabbed the wad of cash, which was when the officers arrived.

Malloy tells both men that if they have to come out there again, someone will go to jail. Act Two The next morning they get another call: ""1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12, see the woman, 415 fight. 1882 North Academy Drive...""

For the uninitiated: Section 415 of the California Penal Code stands for ""disturbing the peace,"" ""disorderly conduct,"" etc. And when adults turn to fisticuffs to settle their differences, that's a classic disturbance of the peace. Sure enough, the officers arrive to find Wellman and Roemer, locked in a mutual wrestling grip, kicking at each other, on the floor of Sid Roemer's garage.

The story is as simple as it is brutal: Wellman broke into the garage to steal the boat when he thought Roemer wouldn't wake up. Roemer caught him at it, and the two got into the fight. Roemer charges Wellman with felony attempted grand-theft marine (or whatever you'd call it). Wellman counters with a charge of assault and battery. So Malloy and Reed take both men to the precinct, and advise Agnes Wellman and Wendy Roemer that they might want to let their husbands cool their heels in jail rather than bail them out.

At the precinct, Malloy begs Sergeant Jerry Miller to find some ground, any ground, on which to hold them. ""We've had to go out there three times in the last twenty-four hours, and now both men are filing felony charges. And it's just spite!"" he says.

Sadly, the sergeant can't hold them. The reason: each man will drop his charges if the other man will drop his.

Malloy is heartsick, but reminds Reed sharply, as they continue their patrol that night, that ""if you punished everybody who was going to do something, you'd have half the country in jail.""

Then comes the call Malloy dreads: ""1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12, see the woman, unknown trouble. 1882 North Academy Drive. 1-Adam-12, handle. Code 2.""

Unknown trouble. The worst kind of trouble call in a way, because they don't know what to expect.

The boys arrive, and at first hear nothing, then see nothing. Then, from Sid Roemer's garage, Agnes' anguished voice cries out in open sobs, and the name ""Miles!"" The two rush into the garage, to find Miles Wellman unconscious, and Agnes bending over him, saying only, ""He hit him.""

Malloy, with difficulty, persuades the distraught Agnes to go to her own house to call an ambulance. Then, leaving Reed to guard Wellman, Malloy goes to the front door, identifies himself, and demands entry. A sober Sid says, from inside, that the door is open.

Malloy goes through the full motions of making an arrest: hands behind the head, feet spread, frisk, handcuffs, the whole nine yards. In the process, Sid begs Wendy to understand: ""I couldn't take it anymore, Wendy. You do see that?""

""No,"" says Wendy, even more distraught than Agnes was, though a good deal quieter. ""I don't see.""

Tag

Sgt. Miller tells the two officers he has checked with the hospital. The charges will be homicide, as Miles Wellman was pronounced dead on arrival.

Sid Roemer has confessed: Sid caught Miles breaking into his garage again. Miles came after him with a boathook. Sid then had no choice, as he said, but to brain Wellman with a fire extinguisher. Except the doctors report Sid must have struck Wellman three vicious blows.

All Sid would say, says the sergeant, is that he got tired of Miles Wellman pushing him around.

""Tell him,"" says Malloy, ""he pushed back a little too hard."""

Her husband, Mr. True, has an infirm mother who Amalia must care for, while still making deliveries for the bakery as Mr. True is not a wealthy man. She suffers a few miscarriages, which are not shown but referred to, then Mr. True suddenly dies of a disease that the elder Mrs. True somehow survives, but remains bedridden in need of care. Amalia is attentive, but must struggle with the deliveries, as they have the house but nothing else from her late husband. The marriage was so short that when the object of Amalia's true interest returns from out of town, now successful, his new wife (bc she'd been married off, he found another, presumably) is pregnant. The baker lady rubs it in Amalia's face, now that she is reduced even lower than she had been before marriage. Amalia jumps off the pier, to kill herself.

Scene switch: aboard a space craft. Very Doctor Who sort of set design, costume and props. What's going on aboard the spaceship is not clear at all, except that there's a possibly benevolent alien entity (Galanthe - yes, aha! a reference to The Nevers - indeed, the viewer begins to suspect that these scenes are an editing/cutting error or mistake by the network airing the wrong thing after The Nevers intro). One of the main characters is a cynical, jaded drug addict soldier (who calls herself Stripe), most of the people of this age are apparently spores (guessing clones or some such) and an actual planet-born human full of idealism tries to inspire the female soldier in the heat of battle, before getting herself killed, which does seem to distress the soldier. Who were they battling? Apparently other humans unsure of Galanthe's intent - super unclear.

Jarring Scene Switch: Amalia True/Stripe is being hauled out of the Thames, everyone knows she attempted suicide and is amazed she survives, but she is committed to an asylum. She appears to have taken on the personality of the spaceship soldier Stripe, complete with Stripe's American accent and coarse language/behavior. There were lights in the sky on the night she was rescued from the water, and it appears these were spores (how are spores now sparks of light that imbue powers and not clones? unexplained that they use the same word for drastically different things) to have given some people powers. Amalia/Stripe quickly realizes she should keep her future identity secret, pretends not to have seen lights in the sky, but inwardly she decides this is the help the idealist aboard her ship presumed humanity would get from the alien entity Galanthe, to save Earth from certain self-destruction. Stripe stealthily (or she imagines it so) takes over the asylum, while acquiring a British accent and manners during tutoring from another inmate, as she does not currently possess most of Amalia's memories. Stripe befriends Sarah, but betrays her when Dr. Hague shows up, looking for 'the touched' - Stripe tells him she doesn't know what he's talking about but Sarah does (thus, Maladie's origin story is revealed) and Sarah is taken away. Stripe has fantasies/premonitions about Dr. Cousens, who also caught a spore/power and was working in the sanitarium. Mrs. Bidlow shows up, appears to know that Stripe is touched, visits Stripe, now in a padded cell, and offers her an alternate living situation, in which she can still care for the turned.

Scene switch: Stripe/Amalia is trying to find the enemy of The Touched with those who chose her mission, but actually chasing Galanthe with her B-Team, falls through the floor of the building and finds Galanthe. She tries to get answers from the bright orb, and is rewarded with visions of her previous life as Amalia, but little else. B-Team reunites with A-Team, only to learn that Penance and the crew had equally poor luck achieving their mission, but Mrs. True tells her friend Penance that she made the right choice, in any case. The Touched seem not to know about the switcheroo Maladie pulled off and are still no wiser as to the identity of those working against them. END."
