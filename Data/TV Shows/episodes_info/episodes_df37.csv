The recap below contains plot spoilers about Episode 1: Smoke Gets In Your Eyes. If you haven't seen episode 1 check out the Mad Men Schedule to see when we're airing encore presentations or download it on iTunes.

Inside a swank New York City bar, men in suits sip martinis and throw their heads back in laughter. Don Draper, however, sits alone at a booth and scribbles words on a cocktail napkin next to an ashtray of crumpled cigarettes. When a waiter comes by, Don - the creative director for Sterling Cooper ad agency - tries to convince him to convert from his choice of smokes, Old Gold, to his brand, Lucky Strikes.

""Reader's Digest says it will kill you,"" the waiter says.

""Yeah,"" Don pauses and looks around the room. Every hand at the bar holds a cigarette. ""I heard about that.""

That night, Don knocks on the door of a sultry artist, Midge. Despite her flirtations, he's all business. The trade commission has cracked down on tobacco health claims, and Don's without a plan for tomorrow's meeting to keep the Lucky Strike account from leaving the agency: ""All I have is a crush-proof box and four out of five dead people smoked your brand."" He asks to run some ideas past her but when she unbuttons her white blouse to reveal a lacy black bra, he decides to take a break from work for awhile.

The next morning, while Don suggests he and Midge get married, the revolving door of one Madison Avenue high rise whirls with businessmen. On the floor of Sterling Cooper, up-and-comer Pete Campbell - accompanied by an audience of three smooth-talking execs - speaks angelically on the phone to his fiancé. ""I love you,"" he says, igniting chuckles from the men, whose only concern is planning a bachelor party. ""I'm giving up my life to be with you, aren't I?""

Meanwhile, Joan - with fire-engine red hair and the perfect hourglass figure - introduces new girl Peggy to life as a secretary. Among other skills, Joan recommends showing a little leg, encourages her not to be overwhelmed by the typewriter's technology and offers her a doctor who prescribes contraceptives to unmarried women.

As the antacid fizzes in his glass of water, Don stands in his corner office. When he reaches to grab some weights, a purple heart - labeled ""Lt. Donald Francis Draper"" - falls to the floor. He puts it back in the drawer without much thought as Salvatore enters with a mockup of the new Lucky Strikes ad. It's a sketching of a bare-chested man next to a white box with a read dot. The word Relax is at the top. As Salvatore stares proudly at his handiwork and contemplates a pre-meeting drink, Greta - a researcher - comes in to share her report that people's desire for cigarettes is actually a Freudian death wish, and that if you love danger, you should love smoking.

""We can put a skull and crossbones on the label,"" Salvatore jokes.

Greta hands the report to Don who promptly files it into the trashcan. ""I'll take that drink now,"" Don says.

When Peggy brings Pete into Don's office for their next meeting, he looks her up and down. ""Who's your little friend here?"" he asks.

On their way to a meeting with a Jewish-owned department store, Don offers Pete some man-to-man advice about how his playboy escapades - despite the fact that his wedding is this Sunday - will make it hard to climb the ladder. ""You'll die in that corner office, a midlevel exec with a little bit of hair who women go home with out of pity."" Pete's coy smile quickly faded as they walked into the boardroom.

Surprised to find a woman at the other end of the table - along with David Coen, a token Jewish employee from the mailroom - Don has little patience for Rachel Menken's demands to turn her store into the next Chanel nor her distaste for his less-than-innovative idea to offer coupons to housewives. ""I'm not going to let a woman talk to me that way,"" he says as he walks out the door. As David reaches for the pitcher of bloody mary's, Pete follows closely behind Don to offer his superficial support.

""Having money and education doesn't take the rude edge out of people,"" Pete says.

Soon after, Don and Pete join Roger Sterling, the head of the company, in welcoming The Lucky Strike family to the office. While everyone coughs through smoke rings, Roger advises that they are no longer allowed to advertise that cigarettes are safe and opens the floor to Don's big idea.

Silence fills the room as Don fumbles through papers and stammers over his words. Pete jumps up to fill the void, and he offers up the ""death wish"" psychology from Don's trashed report. Shocked by the ""you're-going-to-die-anyway"" slogan, the Lucky Strike gentlemen get up to leave.

Just then, Don has an epiphany. ""Advertising is based on one thing,"" Don says. ""Happiness."" Everyone else's tobacco is poisonous, but Lucky Strike's is ""toasted."" Within moments, the Lucky Strike folk are sold.

Back in Don's office, Roger encourages Don to reconsider the presidential campaign - the agency's got a young, handsome navy hero by the name of Dick Nixon.

With her first day nearly complete, Peggy thanks Don for standing up for her with Pete. She rests her hand on his. After an awkward moment, he removes it. ""I'm your boss, not your boyfriend."" He then chastises her for letting Pete go through his garbage to get the report but tells her that she has a fresh start tomorrow.

The young execs, led by Pete, hit the gentlemen's club and soon find themselves surrounded by girls. ""I love this place,"" one of them says. ""It's hot, loud and filled with men."" Salvatore, his eyes twinkling as he scans the room, agrees.

Meanwhile, Don attempts to reconcile with Rachel, and she teases that the flashy mai tai nearly does the trick. When he asks why she's not married, she admits that - aside from wanting to have the option to be a businesswoman - she's never been in love.

""The reason you haven't felt it is because it doesn't exist,"" he says. ""What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons."" Soon, she agrees to come back to the office.

The bachelor party long over, Pete shows up at Peggy's door. She asks why he came. He leans in, his lips brushing against her bangs. ""I wanted to see you tonight,"" he whispers. Without a moment of hesitation, she lets him in.

It's been a long day for Don, and as the rain pours down from the night sky, he takes the train to a parking lot where he drives his car and pulls up next to a picturesque home. As he walks up the stairs to his bedroom, a woman - his wife - wakes up to greet him. He then crosses the hall and walks into the bedroom of his two young children. As he strokes their hair, he looks off into space."

The recap below contains plot spoilers about ""Episode 2: Ladies Room.""

Roger Sterling, three martinis into his dinner with Don and their wives, recounts his upbringing and urges Don to open up about the same. In the ladies room of the restaurant, Betty's hands go numb and Roger's wife Mona must assist her with her lipstick.

Back home, Betty -- tipsy from drinking -- continues Roger's line of questioning and asks her husband if he ever had a nanny. ""It's like politics, religion or sex,"" he says. ""Why talk about it?"" When he finally says that he never had a caretaker, they make love.

The next day at Sterling Cooper, Peggy -- dressed less frumpy than her first day -- chats with Joan about getting her very first paycheck. Peggy's reverie is interrupted when they enter the ladies room and see Bridget sobbing near the stalls.

In Don's office, a group of the junior ad execs clamor around their latest project: canisters of Right Guard, the first aerosol deodorant. Dale and Paul decide to unwittingly test the product on Ken just as Bertram Cooper, one of the agencys partners, steps in. He wants Don to reconsider taking on the Nixon election campaign, and after some discussion, he agrees.

Joan decides to take Peggy out for lunch, but before they make it out the door, Ken, Dale and Harry offer to take them out. Between flirtatious remarks and sexual innuendos, they admit that the office has been rife with speculation about whether or not Peggy has any romantic attachments.

Back at the Draper house, Betty sits in the kitchen with her friend Francine. Francine, six months pregnant, puffs her cigarette as she gossips about a new neighbor, Helen Bishop, a divorcee with a 9-year-old boy and a baby.

A bit later, Betty drives down the tree-lined street in her station wagon with her children, Robert and Sally. As she slows down to watch Helen drag boxes into her new Dutch colonial, her hands go numb and drop from the wheel. The car bounds up a curb and hits a bird bath on the lawn.

Meanwhile, Don rolls off Midge's bed. He looks for a lighter -- and his underwear. He's surprised to see a small portable TV. ""I remember someone wasting a good piece of a beautiful afternoon reciting a diatribe against television,"" he says. When he won't let up, Midge grabs the set by the handle and drops it out her window without a glance.

Hours later, Don arrives home and apologizes for not being reachable when Betty was at the hospital. Betty, who has seen several doctors to no avail, wonders if her numbness isn't a physical condition but a psychological one. She asks if she should see a psychiatrist. ""Doctors must love that they finally have an answer for 'I dont know whats wrong,'"" Don says.

At the next meeting for the Right Guard account, Paul tries to push copy that compares the aerosol can to space-aged astronauts. Don disagrees, contending that the future is actually something that many people fear. Instead, he thinks targeting women might be more effective, but none of the men in the room can figure out just what these women want.

Disgruntled from yet another futile creative gathering, Paul chats up Peggy at the pie cart. He then gives her an unofficial tour of the office and explains the delicate hierarchy of the different departments: There's media -- they buy space and sell at a markup -- as well as accounting, account management -- those with no talent and plenty of vanity -- and, of course, creative.

Feeling guilty for assuming that Betty has it all and has nothing to be unhappy about, Don comes home with a white gold watch. She's thankful but, through tears, asks again if she should see someone.

At 11 a.m. the following day, Don sits outside Midge's apartment. He took his wife to a shrink and called in sick. Over on Park Avenue, Betty lies on the leather daybed of Dr. Arnold Wayne and awkwardly alludes to her anxiety.

With Don out of the office the Sterling Cooper creative team is scarce. Unlike Salvatore, Peggy remains hard at work. She knocks on Paul's office to tell him that she's too busy to go to lunch, and he responds by closing his door and kissing her. She pulls away. ""I think we've misunderstood each other,"" she says, admitting that there's someone else. Back at her desk, she's ready to follow suit and leave early until Joan arrives with more work. Noticeably moody, Peggy asks, ""Why is it that every time a man takes you out to lunch, you are the dessert?"" Ready to break down in tears, she heads to the ladies room only to find yet another woman already doing so by the stalls.

Feeling better after a romp with Midge and after figuring out that what women really want is ""any excuse to get closer,"" Don takes his wife out to dinner in the city before heading home. As he watches Betty climb the stairs to bed, he goes into his study and shuts the door behind him. He picks up the phone and calls Dr. Wayne who remarks, ""I had a very interesting hour with your wife this afternoon."""

Ominously, when Don goes into the bathroom and closes the door, the vibration makes a nail come loose on his award and causes the horseshoe to turn 180 degrees.

Don is late for work, but everyone compliments him on his award. Someone says there is a photo of him in an advertising journal. Don says it is a good thing no one reads it. Peggy tells him some people have commented on his lateness by saying his award has gone to his head. How rude, Don says off-handedly. Don has a meeting scheduled with his account executives, but only one, Ken Cosgrove, is there. Ken has been showing Peggy the short story he just got published in the Atlantic Monthly. He tells Don about it. Peter Campbell and Paul join the meeting and are surprised to learn that Ken is a writer let alone that he has published something. Ken tells them about the plots of his two novels, and Paul ruefully comments, Those ideas aren't even stupid, and asks if he can read the manuscript of one of the novels. Ken agrees. The meeting officially begins as they discuss a client, a bank that is giving away toasters to new customers. There is more or less general agreement that this give-away idea is not only stale but targets women who rarely control the family purse strings. Paul and Don come up with the idea of private (Paul's word) or executive (Don's word) accounts for men, obviously geared toward men who want to keep some of their finances away from their wives.

After the meeting, Peggy tells Don he has a call from Bix Beiderbecke. This turns out to be Midge who tells Don she used the late trumpeter's name because she wants to play the horn. Peggy picks up the phone without remembering that it is still open to the line Don is using. She overhears Midge ask Don to come over and ravish her immediately. Peggy carefully re-cradles the phone. Don comes out of his office and tells Peggy he'll be gone until after lunch.

The account executives, other than Ken, gather in Pete's office. Pete and Paul are especially self-pitying and jealous of Ken's success. Pete complains that Ken's father is just a salesman, to which Paul retorts, what difference does that make? But when Pete observes that Ken has been published in a national publication, which his own father reads, Paul agrees, That hurts.

Later in the episode, Ken is regaling the secretarial pool about his novels. Paul walks in and says he read one and it is good. Saying that he would like to give his girlfriend a copy of Ken's story to read, Paul takes the magazine from Ken and tears out the pages, folds them, and puts them in his breast pocket. Later still, when the two men are alone, Paul apologizes for his behavior, explaining that he just never thought that he was in competition with Ken. You lost, says Ken.

Don and Midge finish making love, and, as Midge points out, Don waits until that moment to complain about Midge calling him at work. But Don allows that he likes coming to see her, and she comments that he seems like two different people and that he becomes a different person as soon as he comes into Midge's apartment.

At a general meeting, Sterling compliments Ken on finishing something and makes several of his usual comments implying that nobody at the agency really ever does any work. Accounts from previous episodes, including the Lucky Strike cigarette one, are mentioned, so we know these are still on-going. Sterling says they will have to wait until after the November elections to see whether the government is likely to take any action against the tobacco industry. The meeting is interrupted by Peggy with a message for Don. A man named Adam Whitman has arrived and is asking for Don. Don looks stunned. He leaves the meeting and confronts Adam who says, It really is you, Dick. He says he is Don's brother, and he works as a janitor. He found the advertising journal with Don's picture in an office trash can. He had thought Don/Dick was dead. Don tries to deny he is Dick, but Adam does not believe that. Don promises to meet Adam at a coffee shop at noon. Don goes back to the meeting but is so distracted that he almost doesn't respond when he is called upon.

Don meets Adam in the coffee shop. Adam reveals that Don disappeared after the Korean War and that his mother has now died. Don comments, she wasn't my mother and she never let me forget that. Adam says that after his mother died Dad passed, too. Don does not indicate whether he has any feelings about that. Adam says that, back in 1953, he had thought he saw Dick/Don in his uniform peeking out of a window. He always suspected his brother was still alive. He wants to know why Don left, but Don only says he couldn't go back. Don finally admits that he missed Adam, but he won't tell Adam anything about his life now. When Adam says he wants to be in Don's life again, Don says, no. He gets up to leave and says that this meeting never happened.

Meanwhile, Betty and her two children arrive at the office because there is an appointment with a photographer for a family portrait. Peggy panics and seeks advice from Joan about what to do. Joan persuades Peggy to tell where she suspects Don is, which is with Midge. Joan says Peggy should not have told that about her boss but promises she'll never tell. She also advises Peggy to keep it simple and just say she forgot to remind Don. Let him come up with his own excuse. He'll have one.

Peggy awkwardly entertains Betty. At one point, Betty makes the remark that Peggy knows Don better than she. Peggy does not say anything. Don returns and says he was at the printers. Peggy tries taking the blame, but Don plays the gracious boss. When he walks out with his family, Peggy is considerably relieved. She later discusses it with Joan, telling her that this seems like an odd job. Joan says that this is the greatest job, apparently reveling in the intrigue.

Betty tells her neighbor and best friend that Don's forgetting that they had an appointment leads her to doubt he puts her very high on his list of priorities. They agree that their husbands behave infinitely better in the suburbs than they do in Manhattan.

Don and his team meet with the banker and tell him their idea about private executive accounts. The banker does not completely reject the idea, but he laughs. When Don asks why, he explains: 1) Many men already have such accounts, there just hasn't been a name for it; 2) advertising the existence of such accounts might only bring up embarrassing conversations between husbands and wives.

Pete and his wife,Trudy, discuss his short story, which is about a hunter and a bear. Trudy thinks it is odd because the bear seems to be talking. Pete explains that the bear is not talking; that is just what the hunter thinks the bear is thinking. He would like her to help get it published by using her connection with Charlie Fiddich, who is in publishing, even though Pete knows that Charlie is her ex-lover. Trudy is clearly hurt over being essentially pimped out to Charlie, but she agrees to go see him. Sure enough, when she meets with Charlie he propositions her, but she pleads for him to drop it.

Don receives an envelope from Adam. It contains a photo of Dick/Don in his uniform with a boy, presumably Adam. With it is a slip of paper from a hotel with a note from Adam telling Don his room number is 5G.

Trudy reports to Pete that his story is to be published in Boys' Life magazine. Pete is disappointed. They'll probably put it next to an ad for exploding cigars. He whines that his story is good enough for the New Yorker and accuses Trudy of deliberately holding him back. Trudy says she could have gotten it into the New Yorker. Pete asks why didn't she. She asks how he could put her in that position. Pete just pouts, evidently not picking up, or not caring(?), that Trudy is implying that in order to get his story published in a better magazine she would have had to sleep with Charlie.

At the Draper family dinner table, Betty is talking about her parents' summer home in Cape May and how it is so far away from New York that Don is hardly ever there. She asks Don why he is preoccupied, and he says he is trying to decide whether he must go back to the office tonight.

After dinner, Don calls Adam and tells him he will come see him in 25 minutes. Don opens a desk drawer and puts an open briefcase on top of the desk. He reaches into the drawer and begins to remove something. Don brings the brief case to Adam's room in a very modest hotel/rooming house. Adam is ecstatic, noting that Don looks more like the person he remembers than he did during their earlier meetings. Don asks whether Adam has anyone in his life; specifically, he asks about Abigail and Uncle Mac. Adam says they are not in his life, without saying explicitly whether or not they are dead. Adam comments on Don's success and says they always said Don was too smart for his own good. Then he recalls that Mac always said Don was too soft. But you aren't soft, are you? No, says Don, I'm not. Don explains that he has a new life and it only goes in one direction: forward. He opens the briefcase and gives his brother five thousand dollars. (Known in slang as five grand or five G, just like Adam's room number.) Don tells Adam to take the money, leave New York, and never contact Don again. Anguished, Adam says that this isn't what he wanted from Don. Don tells him, This is all that I can give you. He tells Adam to go back to thinking that his brother is dead. He urges Adam to reflect on the fact that with five thousand dollars (a lot of money in 1960) he could make a new life for himself. Don allows Adam to hug him, but Don breaks it off first. You going to be OK? Don says. Adam nods. When Don gets home, Betty tells him she knows that Don is uncomfortable about having to use her parents' summer home. He says, I just don't like the way your father looks at me. She replies, Well, you took away his little girl. Betty then suggests that they buy their own summer home, perhaps closer to New York. But Don says that he likes going to Cape May. Besides, we're not that flush right now. It's nothing to worry about, but maybe we can afford to buy a summer home next year. Uncharacteristically, there is no ironic song on the sound track at the end of this episode."

Don shows Midge his bonus check and tries to persuade her to come with him on an impromptu trip to Paris, but she turns him down. Don has a flashback to his Depression Era childhood when Don's name was Dick: A hobo comes to their house and, while the man of the house (Dick's father Archie Whitman) tries to reject the hobo, Dick's stepmother Abigail Whitman takes in the hobo and tries to give him a coin in advance for working for food. The head of the house confiscates the coin, implying he will pay the hobo after he has worked. The hobo talks to Dick before bedtime and teaches him symbols used by hobos to mark houses they visit. The last symbol means ""a dishonest man lives here."" Dick reveals that someone has taught him to think of himself as ""the whore's son."" (We are not told who calls him this.) The hobo seems to be the first person Dick has ever met who doesn't want to stigmatize him. The next day, the hobo works, but Archie doesn't pay him.

Don steps out into the lobby of a theater. He seems less than thrilled that Fiorello! is only half over when Jim Hobart approaches. Jim, the head of a rival advertising agency, mentions how he and some of New York's most influential were talking about Don's campaigns at the Athletic Club. He encourages Don to consider moving up in the professional world. ""If you were with me at McCann, you'd have over 500 people at your disposal,"" he says. ""We can get a lot of things done.""

Their wives approach. Adele, Jim's wife, links arms with Don to get drinks at the bar while Jim chats up Betty. He sees an uncanny resemblance in Betty to Grace Kelly. She admits to dabbling in modeling when she was younger, and Jim thinks she could be just the look for his Coca-Cola campaign. She takes his business card.

The next day, as Betty tidies up the kids toys -- including a BB gun -- she tells Francine about Jim's offer. She remembers when she was a muse to Italian fashion designer Gianni. Within moments, they are in her bedroom as Betty tries on all the dresses he'd made for her.

When Don gets to his office, he notices a package on his desk. It's from Jim, and it's a membership to the Athletic Club. Don calls him and proceeds to listen to Jim's pitch, which includes a high salary, an international network and clients that include Pan Am and Esso. Don thanks him for the gift and hangs up.

At Dr. Wayne's office, Betty continues to revel in her days as a model. She explains that she met Don while modeling a coat. She also remembers how her mother was dead set against her nascent career, comparing modeling to prostitution. ""You're angry at your mother,"" Dr. Wayne stated. For the first time, Betty took offense to his provocation: ""She wanted me to be beautiful so I could find a man -- there's nothing wrong with that.""

In the Sterling Cooper conference room, the men watch a 30-second video of Jackie Kennedy speaking in Spanish and discuss their plan of attack for how to handle Nixon's campaign. Salvatore thinks women will hate Jackie anyway: ""It's like their better-looking sister married a handsome Senator and now she's going to live in the White House? I'm practically jealous.""

Back at the Draper residence, Betty pulls a ham from the fridge while she reveals to Don that she wants to return to modeling for a few days a week. Don starts to argue but gives up.

The next day, Peggy feverishly scrubs a piece of paper with an eraser when it drops to the floor. When she bends to pick it up, she hears a loud rip. Her skirt split down the side. She ties a sweater around her waist and goes into the break room, where Joan, Marge and Lois are chatting. Joan offers Peggy her spare outfit to avoid ruining her silhouette.

Meanwhile, Roger shows up in Don's office with golf clubs. He says they're from Jim and mentions the bonus Cooper gave him. ""It was designed as a kind of armor against men like Jim Hobart,"" he says. ""I like to think there's more holding you to Sterling Cooper than trinkets."" Roger tries to explain that big clients such as Pan Am aren't as glamorous as they seem and the hands-on approach doesn't follow to big companies, but Don remains silent. ""It's business,"" he says.

As the other men gossip about Don's offer, they notice Peggy in a very attractive yet ill-fitting dress. They switch subjects and focus on Peggy's newfound big-headedness now that she's writing copy. Pete, however, just listens before leaving entirely.

He and Harry retreat to his office to discuss the Secor laxatives campaign before they go on a tangent about fraternity memories. As Pete's halfway through a story about how one of his pledges had a funeral for the house dog, Mamie, during a beauty pageant parade, he gets an idea. To boost Nixon's chances in the undecided states, they'll need to decrease Kennedy's presence there -- and they'll do that by buying up on-air ads for laxatives. ""We're selling laxatives, Nixon's selling Nixon and Kennedy's watching Mamie's funeral,"" Pete says.

In the reception area of McCann Erickson sit a row of young models. Among them is Betty, wearing the dress she'd tried on earlier. Clearly overdressed, she fidgets with self-consciousness until Jim arrives. His colleague Ronnie Gittridge, who handles the art for Coca-Cola, escorts her to the audition.

The phone rings at the Draper residence. It's for Betty. She's the girl with the Cola. Feeling proud, she seduces Don, and as he unzips her dress, he seems genuinely happy for her.

The next day, Betty puts on a smile for the photographer as she sits on a picnic blanket with her bottle of soda. Meanwhile, Ethel -- in her 60s -- sits asleep on the couch as Robert, Sally and their dog Polly barrel through the living room into the backyard. Just then, their neighbor Ross lets some pigeons out of a cage and Polly grabs one in her mouth. Quickly, Ross grabs Polly by the collar and the bird falls from her mouth. It's wounded but healthy. ""I see that dog in my yard again, I'm going to shoot it,"" he says.

That night, Betty wakes up to the sound of Sally sniffling and sobbing. She had a bad dream that Ross was going to kill Polly. This is news to Don and Betty. Angry, Don gets up to have a few words with his neighbor, but Betty stops him.

In Don's office, Harry, Paul and Pete all compliment -- some more reluctantly than others -- Don's work on the Lucky Strike campaign when >Roger and Cooper barge in. ""Who is responsible?"" Cooper asks, regarding the purchase of yet unproduced Secor commercials. Harry and Pete timidly take ownership, and to their surprise, get nothing but congratulations.

Before Don leaves, he gets another envelope from Jim. This time it's pictures of Betty and her ideal family from the shoot. A bit disgusted, Don flips them face down and leaves and beelines for Roger's office. He demands a raise with no contract and Roger obliges, happy with Don's decision to stay. Don assures his boss that if he leaves, it won't be for advertising. ""I'd like to stop talking about it and get back to it some day,"" he says about life.

Don calls Jim to decline the offer, despite Jim getting his wife into the company. ""It's a pity to lose both of you,"" he says. Meanwhile, Betty poses for another shoot when Ronnie approaches with some bad news. They're looking for more Audrey Hepburn, less Grace Kelly.

Pete and the boys are celebrating his success in the bullpen when Peggy walks by. As they did before, they make fun of her. ""They call a girl like her a lobster,"" Ken says. ""All the meat's in the tail."" All of a sudden, Pete clocks Ken in the jaw. They fight onto the ground while Don and Roger leave, unphased.

That night, Betty tells Don over a casserole that although they offered her many possibilities, she doesn't think she wants to go back to modeling after all. Don gets it. The next day, Betty goes through her morning routine and sits in the kitchen. When she notices the pigeons circling the sky, she grabs the BB gun, takes aim and fires at the birds."

The recap below contains plot spoilers about Episode 10: Long Weekend. If you haven't seen episode 10 check out the Mad Men Schedule to see when we're airing encore presentations, watch it On Demand, or download it on iTunes.

Don comes down the steps for work as Sally cheers, Grandpas here! And Aunt Gloria! He goes into the kitchen to find Bettys dad sitting at the table, Gloria standing beside him. He wants sugar in his tea, but Betty only allows him saccharine. Theyre getting ready to leave for the beach when Betty suggestively asks Don to help her with something upstairs.

Was she waiting at the funeral unbuttoning her top button? Betty asks, regarding her fathers new girlfriend. Shes a vulture. Don tries to calm her down and suggests that her father cant even fix himself a cup of tea by himself after having been married for 40 years.

Don heads to the office for one more day before the long weekend. There, the men are watching a Kennedy campaign, trying to strategize their next move for their pro-bono work with Nixon. Perhaps a negative ad would be more powerful than a positive one, which only attracts people who already like him. Don thinks there is more to the story: Kennedy? Nouveau riche, a recent immigrant who bought his way into Harvard. Nixon is from nothing. Abe Lincoln of California, a self-made man. Kennedy, I see a silver spoon. Nixon, I see myself.

They cut that meeting short for another, this one with the Menkens -- both Rachel and her father Abraham. Abraham is somewhat open to the suggestions Sterling Cooper offers -- they want to add a restaurant on the ground floor and close the store during construction -- but he has concerns that hes creating a store that even he wouldnt shop in.

Don, looking at Rachel, describes how his customers have changed: Theyre like your daughter, educated and sophisticated. They are fully aware of what they deserve and are willing to pay for it.

Roger passes Joan in the hall and tells her that his wife and daughter are out of town this weekend, so they can do whatever they want. Instead, she asks to see the new movie, The Apartment before making a comparison to how Shirley MacLaines character was handed around to the office men like a tray of canapés.

As Joan puts up a memo in the break room, her friend Carol -- her eyes bloodshot -- walks in. She had just gotten fired after covering for her boss. These men, were always building them up, and for what? Joan says. Diner and jewelry? Who cares? They decide to spend the weekend on the town in search of actual bachelors.

Meanwhile, Pete walks into Dons office with some bad news. They lost the Dr. Scholls account because, as Pete says, they were disappointed with the creative. Angry, Don shoves everything off his desk onto the floor. He goes to Rogers office, where hes getting his hair trimmed, and tells him the latest.

The day you sign a client is the day you start losing them, Roger says, echoing Dons sentiments.

On the main floor, Pete pesters Peggy while she tries to ignore him. Every time I walk by I wonder, are you going to be nice to me or cruel? Peggy says when he wont let up. Disappointed, Pete walks away.

Meanwhile, the other ad men are busy flirting with a group of models, all sets of twins, at the Cartwright double-sided aluminum casting call. Roger and Don show up and set their sights on Eleanor and Mirabelle Ames. Roger hires them on the spot and requests a private celebration upstairs in his office. Drinks all around, Roger flirts relentlessly. Do you love your sister? he prods. Why dont you show her how much? Give her a kiss. Before anything happens, Don rises to leave. Before he can, Eleanor asks him to dance.

Across town, Joan and Carol are getting ready in Joans bedroom. When Joan notices Carol staring, Carol reveals her true feelings. I did everything I could to be near you -- all with the hope that one day you would notice me, she says. Joannie, just think of me as a boy. As she finishes packing her purse, Joan simply asks if they can forget about it and just go out.

Later that night, Joan and Carol return with Franklin, a Fordham college professor, and Ralph, a carpenter. When Joan asks Franklin to change her light bulb -- in her bedroom -- Ralph makes a move on Carol.

Back at Sterling Cooper, Don and Eleanor sit in Dons office when they hear Mirabelle scream. I knew I shouldnt have asked him to do it a second time, she says. Don rushes in to find Roger, naked on the floor. Several moments later, two orderlies push a gurney with a conscious Roger toward the elevator lobby.

At the hospital, Roger recovers from a heart attack and asks Don if he believes in human energy, like a soul. When his wife Mona arrives, he breaks down and cries. Then, his daughter Margaret comes in. The three embrace.

That night, Joan rushes to the office to help Cooper send out telegrams to all Roger Sterling clients, assuring them that business will go uninterrupted. She holds back tears as Cooper tells her she could do better. Don calls Betty to tell him he wont be going to the beach house, and Pete watches a television ad for Kennedy -- in which President Eisenhower trashes Nixon -- in the hospital waiting room.

Don knocks on the door of an apartment. Rachel, in a robe with tousled hair, answers. She lets him in and fixes him a drink. He leans in and kisses her desperately. Is this like the end of the world, she asks, stopping him. Just do whatever you want?

Don opens up and talks about the first time he was a pall bearer and being that close to death. This is it, this is all there is, he says. And its slipping through my fingers. They kiss passionately, slowly laying back onto the couch. He asks if she really wants this. Yes, please, she replies.

Afterwards, Don opens up once more. His mother was a prostitute, and when she died in childbirth, they delivered the baby to his father and his wife. His father was a drunk who got kicked in the face by a horse. When he died, she took up with another man. I was raised by those two sorry people."

The package is addressed to Donald Draper at 405 Madison Avenue. It costs 40 cents, but Adam hands the man a $5 bill.

Back in his hotel room, Adam throws the pile of bills that Don gave him on the table. He places a note that says, ""Enjoy next to the pile"". Then, he removes his belt and pulls a chair next to a ceiling pipe. He threads the belt around his neck and around the pipe before kicking the chair out from under him. His feet dangle as he hangs himself.

Its October at Sterling Cooper, and Roger is still out recovering. Joan prods Don about his condition but is flustered by her own lack of aloofness.

The ad men congregate in Dons office. On the coffee table is a pink plastic belt shaped like womens panties with a small control box and electric cord. After they timidly inspect it, they discover that its a weight loss invention. Whether it actually causes weight loss is yet to be determined, and Pete is skeptical to promote it. It might be a lightning rod for the government and other people out to kill advertising, he says.

Just then, Peggy walks in. As she leaves, the men jokingly suggest that she might be a good candidate to try the Electrosizer. Fred, however, thinks shed be able to put her creative talents to work by testing it out. Later that night, Peggy sits in her bedroom, papers spread on her bed. She decides to give the contraption a try. Peggy turns the dial, and immediately becomes aroused by the vibrations. She peels it off in a hurry.

In another bedroom, Don stares at Rachel. She admits that she thinks about them being together. ""I dont know if I understand how this works or where it goes,"" she says. ""I´m worried this is a fantasy.""

The next day, Peggy awkwardly shares with Don what shes discovered about the Electrosizer. She struggles to explain that she felt something that most women would like to feel. It vibrates, and that coincides with how you wear it, she says. Its probably unrelated to weight loss. Don realizes this new benefit and asks Peggy to figure out how to put it into words.

Cooper tells Don that he just spent the morning talking the Lucky Strike account ""off the ledge."" They recently lost a lawsuit and they are nervous about continuing to do business with Sterling Cooper due to Roger's heart attack. They´ll need to be ready for a big lunch meeting tomorrow -- with Roger.

At the Draper residence, Betty gets a visit from a door-to-door air conditioning salesman named Bob Shaw. When Betty says shes not interested, he asks to come in for a glass of water. He persists, but she doesnt think the Indian Summer will last much longer. He continues to explain how cold air is escaping through their windows and offers to take some measurements. She accepts the offer, and as they both walk up the stairs to look at the bedroom window, she hesitates. ""You know, my husband, I think he´d rather go to Sears,"" she says, forcing him to leave.

That night, when Betty mentions the salesmans suggestions, Don fumes over her letting a stranger into the house.

The next day, Roger -- washed out and tired -- walks with Mona into the bullpen for the first time since his heart attack. A crowd gathers and applauds as he, Don and Cooper go into Rogers office.

Joan enters with instructions to help with his coloring. As she applies foundation to his cheeks, they admit they missed each other. ""I´ve had a lot of time to think about the things I´ve done and been sorry about,"" he says. ""And being with you is not one of them."" Joan wells up with tears.

Men congregate in the conference room for the meeting with Lee Garner Senior and two other Lucky Strike executives. Don and Roger, all smiles, enter and get down to business. Anti-smoking legislation is in progress, but it could be a few years before they put warning signs on packages. Then, Roger lights up a cigarette as he bites into his pastrami sandwich. ""Oh, oh Jesus!"" he shouts, clutching his chest. Once again, Roger is wheeled away by ambulance drivers.

Harry, Paul, Pete, Ken and Salvatore sit in Petes office, debating what might happen to the company. Sal jokes that he already sent out his resume, but Harry thinks Don will become partner. When they all start wondering if Don likes them, Pete shrugs in annoyance.

That evening, Peggy sits at La Trombetta, a seafood restaurant, with her date Carl Winter -- a blue collar truck driver in his best suit. When Peggy mentions how her Belle Jolie copy will appear in some high-fashion magazines, Carl remarks that advertising is simply a lot of people screaming at you from the walls and television. She´s offended, but he reminds her of her reaction when he said he drives a truck for a living. ""You can act like youre from Manhattan, but you don´t look like those girls,"" he says.

Angry, she gets up to leave. ""Those people in Manhattan?"" Peggy says. ""They are better than us. They want things they haven´t seen.""

Later that night, Don calls Dr. Wayne. He´s angry that Betty is in worse shape than she was before therapy. After hundreds of dollars, all you´ve managed to do was make her more unhappy, he says. Dr. Wayne suggests moving toward psychoanalysis, which is at least three visits every week.

The next day, Peggy gives her presentation of the new product. ""Women lose weight so they´ll feel good about themselves,"" she says. ""Combined with a sensible diet, the Rejuvenator -- you´ll love the way it makes you feel."" They love the pitch but are still confused as to what it actually does. ""From what I understand, it provides the pleasure of a man without the man,"" Don says. He offers a critique. It needs a new name and a clever code word so women will know its real utility.

In Ossining Betty attends to the laundry. When the washing machine goes into its spin cycle it begins to clatter against the floor and wall. Leaning it to steady it, she feels the vibrations and closes here eyes as she fantasizes about having sex with the air conditioning salesman on top of her dresser.

Back at the office, Peggy timidly asks for her own desk. She´s interrupted when Cooper asks to speak to Don in private. He offers to make him a partner. When Don accepts, Pete is the first to congratulate him. Don, high off his promotion and raise, gives Peggy a raise, and the rest of the day off. Pete sneaks in to Dons office to sit behind the desk. Just then, the mailroom boy delivers the package from Adam.

Curious, Pete shakes the box. He takes it with him as he leaves."

Don enters with Herman Duck Phillips, who had been in London with Y&R, a bigger agency. He, however, is eager to return to New York and even more eager to take the open job -- Head of Account Services -- at Sterling Cooper.

After Cooper finishes grilling the candidate, Duck and Don walk by the other ad men, whove been chatting about who might be president by the end of the night. Hes the best one Drapers paraded around, Ken says, regarding Duck. Lets see if Cooper is smart enough to know that.

Pete then goes into Dons office to make his case for why he should get the position. I have the loyalty of our most important clients, he says, mentioning Calvin Highland and Lee Garner. These men trust me. Don suggests that Pete, whos been with the company for two and a half years, be patient because hes still at the point where someone will always be his senior.

When Don heads home for the night, he notices Paul, Harry, Joan, Ken, Hildy and some others standing around quietly. As soon as the elevator doors close behind him, the group squeals with laughter. Drinks are passed around and a TV is wheeled out into the bullpen. They flip it on to an anchor reporting that Senator Kennedys odds for victory are a grim 22 to 1. They applaud. Paul pours scotch until the bottle is empty. They are going to need more liquor.

As the night goes on and the numbers get closer, the group gets friskier. Allison walks by and Ken starts to chase her as Paul and Harry shout colors. Ken pulls Allison to the ground and hikes up her skirt to reveal her panties. Who had blue? he shouts back. As everyone laughs, Peggy and Marge stand expressionless. I used to think Id find a husband here, Marge says. Peggy just leaves.

Pete, sitting in the dark living room of his apartment, leafs through Adams shoebox. In it, he peers at dog tags, letters and photographs, one of which shows a young Don and Adam riding horses. He flips it to see Dick and Adam, 1944 written.

Just then, Trudy walks in. Shes noticed him sneaking around with that box and wonders why he wont return it.

Back at Sterling Cooper, Ken comes out of Pauls office with a stack of papers. Death is My Client -- a play in one act by Paul Kinsey, he reads. Paul, embarrassed, tries to get it back. Its not long, however, before hes instead positioning actors around the room and directing the ad hoc production. Joan holds the script as Salvatore, playing Tolefson -- the hero -- reads lines over her shoulder. As he scrolls down the page, he notices a gripping scene. He and Joan look at each other, and Sal pulls in for a dramatic kiss. The audience cheers as they kiss.

Just then, the TV turns up to show that Nixon took Ohio, a pivotal victory. They cheer, dance and embrace. Harry plants a kiss on Hildy, who returns the gesture. Shocked by his own action, Harry retreats to his office. She follows, and they kiss again.

The next morning, Peggy arrives to see the office in shambles and people, coffee in hand, walking around painfully in last nights clothes. She smells something pungent at her desk -- her trashcan is filled with vomit.

Don enters Coopers office, confused by three different newspapers with three different results. A recount of the election means 30 days without a president, which is no way to win, according to Cooper. If Kennedy is willing to buy an election, hes probably willing to play ball with us.

Then, Pete brings Adams box to Don in his office, and when he makes no more progress with the promotion, Pete reveals that he knows Dons past. According to his friend at the defense department, Dick Whitman died in Korea 10 years ago. A man named Donald Draper dropped off the map although hes 43 years old.

Don recognizes the attempt at blackmail but doesnt back down. If your information is powerful enough to make them do what you want, what else can it make them do? he says, fuming. Pete leaves, and Don rips open the box.

He flashes back to a dirt road in Korea in 1950. A lieutenant watches as Dick jumps out of the back of an army truck and is disappointed to see that only one soldier -- he needed 20 for his mission to build a field hospital. Dick introduces himself. The lieutenant follows suit. Draper. Its Lieutenant Don Draper.

Back in his office, Don puts the shoebox in the same drawer as the Purple Heart.

He goes to Rachel Menkens office with a sudden desire to go to Los Angeles with her for good. Although he piques her interest, she reasons that she has a store to run and he has a family. They fight, and she realizes that he doesnt want to run away with her. He just wants to run away.

Don returns to the office and approaches Pete, passing a TV with Kennedys face. ""I thought about what you said, and then I thought about you and what a deep lack of character you have,"" he says, adding that he will hire Duck. Pete threatens to go to Cooper, but Don calls his bluff and walks out to give Cooper the news. Confused at how Don would rather lose it all than see him succeed, Pete follows Don into Coopers office with him. Don tells Cooper hes hiring Duck, then looks to Pete. Pete returns the glance and tells Cooper how Don is really Dick Whitman, a deserter and criminal.

""Who cares?"" Cooper replies as Don calmly lights another cigarette. ""This country was built and run by men with worse stories than whatever you've imagined here.""

Don flashes back to Korea. Dick stands in a trench when Lt. Draper storms out of his tent. Thunderous mortar explosions get closer until gunfire erupts and bullets zoom by their heads. As quickly as the attack began, it ends. The two light cigarettes when they notice a stream of liquid at their feet. Lt. Draper thinks Dick wet himself, but when Dick drops his cigarette, they realize its gasoline.

They run as a fireball drops them to the dirt. Moments later, Dick wakes up and struggles to lift his body, with his arm and ribs broken. He sees whats left of Lt. Don -- guts open, intestines strewn on the ground, flesh charred. He finds Dons dog tags and pulls them from the body. He rips his own off before dangling Dons around his neck.

The next day at the military hospital, Don receives his Purple Heart and news that he's going home -- with the task of returning Dick to his family. When Don and an army chaplain arrive at the rural Pennsylvania train station where the Whitmans stand waiting, he tells the chaplain he can't do it. He watches from a distance as the casket is set near 10-year-old Adam. Just then Adam looks toward the train and makes eye contact with Don. As the train pulls away, Adam shouts: ""There he is, I see him!""

Don, back to reality and at home, turns on his television and watches a replay of Nixons concession speech.

The firm contemplates making some advertisements for candidate Nixon."

Tom thinks it's time to take focus off work. ""The only family and business you should be mixing is the production of a child,"" he says.

At the Draper residence, Betty makes a list of things to bring to her familys home for Thanksgiving. Don, squinting to read a magazine, explains that he cant join her because of his workload as a new partner. ""I don't understand why you can't make my family your family,"" Betty says, aware of Don's real reasons for backing out.

Meanwhile that night, Harry sits in his office and pleads to his wife to let him come home. She rejects the idea, and he settles in for the night.

The next day, Betty comes home from picking up acorn squash to find Francine at the door, distraught. She tells Betty that she was paying the phone bill -- something Carlton normally does -- when she noticed long-distance calls to Manhattan. She called a number, and a woman answered. That, and the fact that he sleeps at the Waldorf two nights a week, makes her believe he's having an affair. Betty tries to comfort her, but Francine says she wishes she could just poison him and then leaves, embarrassed. Then, Betty walks straight into Don's study, grabs the sealed phone bill and slips it into her pocket.

Meanwhile, Duck Phillips holds his first meeting with the ad men at Sterling Cooper. He's disappointed with their current clientele. ""No automobile, airline, pharmaceuticals,"" he says. ""People want cars, they want to fly."" He passes out a list of people they should be wining and dining and mentions that Kodak -- and their new slide projector -- is on the market.

Back at the Drapers, Don arrives home and Betty tells him about Francine's situation. ""How could someone do that to the person they love?"" she says, watching him. He encourages her not to worry.

At the office, Duck puts the carousel slide projector on Don's desk and explains that the delightfully mechanical gadget doesn't jam and is continuous like a wheel. ""Kodak reinvented The Wheel"" Don says, joking.

Over in the engineers booth, Ken and Peggy watch as three women audition their vocal talents for the 'Relax-a-Cizor' on the other side of the glass. Peggy opts to go with Annie, despite Kens partiality to Rita. As Annie stands in front of a music stand and reads the copy into the microphone, Peggy isn't satisfied. She interrupts several times to get Annie to speak with more confidence and beauty. But when Annie doesn't understand Peggys suggestions, she gets choked up.

""This is not working out,"" Peggy says. ""We're going to have to let you go."" As Annie cries, Peggy tells Ken to console her and then have Rita come in for the job.

Don sits in his office, looking at a slide from a box labeled Cape May. He takes another out, holds it up to the lamp, laughs and swaps it for another. Then, he takes the photo of him and Adam riding horses from the shoebox. Unlike the slides, he stares at this one for a long time before he picks up the phone to call Brighton Hotel. He asks for any information on Adam, a former tenant.

""Jesus, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but he hung himself,"" says the night manager. ""He left the building a bunch of money. The city took it.""

That night, Betty eyes the phone bill, noticing eight calls to Manhattan. She picks up the phone and dials the number slowly. After a few rings, a mans voice picks up. ""Who is this?"" Betty asks. It's Dr. Arnold Wayne, her psychiatrist, who doesn't recognise her voice . She hangs up, shocked and ashamed.

The next day, Betty pulls up to a bank, and on her way in, she sees Glen, Helen Bishop's son, in the passenger seat of a green Volkswagen. She walks over.

""I'm not supposed to talk to you,"" Glen says, shyly. She says she doesn't care. ""I can't talk to anyone -- Im so sad,"" she says. ""Please tell me I'll be okay."" He reaches his hand up to her and tells her that he wishes he were older.

That afternoon, Pete tells Don how he took Ducks talk seriously. He brought in a pharmaceutical account from his father-in-laws company, Vicks Chemical, called Clearasil. Don admits that he's impressed. Pete's connection -- and subsequent investment in Sterling Cooper -- got him a bonus from Cooper, along with the Ayn Rand book.

At Dr. Wayne's office, Betty talks about how nerve-wracking it is to get the family together for Thanksgiving. ""Being able to talk, just me and you, has helped,"" she says. ""Still, I can't help but think that I'd be happy if my husband was faithful to me."" As she sneaks a peek back at him, Betty says she feels sorry for Don but should be angry. ""The way he makes love -- sometimes it's what I want, sometimes it's obviously what someone else wants,"" she continues, inhaling her cigarette.

Back at Sterling Cooper, Don hosts a meeting with the Kodak clients. He turns on the projector and flips through slides of him with his newborn baby or the family on Christmas morning. ""This is not a spaceship, it's a time machine,"" he says. ""It goes backwards and forwards, and it takes us to a place where we ache to go again.""

""It's not called The Wheel,"" he continues. ""It's called The Carousel. It let's us travel around and around and back home again."" He concludes with an image of him and Betty kissing on New Years. Overwhelmed with emotion, Harry starts crying and leaves the room. The Kodak clients, equally impressed, cancel their meetings with other agencies.

While they celebrate this victory, Don tells Pete that because young girls buy the blemish-busting Clearasil, Peggy would be the perfect writer for the account.

""Peggy is not even a copywriter,"" he protests. ""She's a secretary."" With that, Don calls Peggy into his office and immediately makes her a junior copywriter with Clearasil as her first task. Pete storms out of the room.

As Joan puts Peggy into a shared office with writer Victor Manny, she encourages Peggy to recognize where she came from or her new job might become doubly difficult. Just then, Peggy grimaces, trying to hide a sidesplitting pain. When her stomachache persists, she goes to the doctor.

""Honey, you didn't mention that you were expecting,"" Dr. Oliver says to Peggy. She replies that that's impossible, and is about to leave when she doubles over in pain. The doctor and nurse quickly realize that she is in labor. That night, a nurse brings a swaddled baby boy to Peggy and encourages her to feed him. She just turns her head away.

As he rides the train back to Ossining Don imagines arriving home as Betty and the kids have finished packing for their trip. ""I'm coming with you,"" Don says. Betty, emotional, watches as he picks up the kids, kissing their heads. When he really does arrive home he arrives to find the house empty. He sits on the steps and holds his head in his hands."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2912494/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"97 years after a nuclear war, human kind is living in space. 100 juvenile delinquents are sent down to Earth to see if the planet is habitable.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Bharat Nalluri'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Clarke (Eliza Taylor) is sketching on the floor, imagining what its like to be on Earth with the sun on her face, trees around her, scent of wildflowers however she is stranded in space. 97 years have passed since a nuclear apocalypse left the planet contaminated by radiation. There were survivors. Twelve nations had operational space stations in orbit at the time but now they are clustered into one, called The Ark. It is believed that Earth will not become survivable for another 100 years, and then they can go back to it

Guards enter the room 17 year-old Clarke is in a prison cell. They stand her up and put a locking wristband on her wrist. Every crime on The Ark is punishable by death, unless you are under 18, where you just get locked up until, at 18, you are reviewed. As a guard tries to take her father's watch, Clarke struggles and runs outside her cell. She looks out at tiers and tiers of cells. As the guards approach Clarke, a woman comes by and tells them to stop. Its Clarke's mom (Paige Turco). Clarke fears she is going to be executed to preserve resources for the remaining citizens. Her mom tells her that is not true, and instead, she, and the other youthful prisoners, The 100, are being sent to the ground. A guard shoots a tranquillizer dart at Clarke and she falls unconscious.

A pod is launched from The Ark. Clarke wakes, strapped in like the other members of The 100, some sitting, some upright. She is surprised to see Wells (Eli Goree) sitting next to her. He explains that when he found out they were going to the ground, he got himself arrested. There is turbulence Wells says its the atmosphere. A video comes on with the Chancellor (Isaiah Washington) explaining that The 100 have been given a second chance, but that the second chance is also for those left on The Ark. He tells them their slates have been wiped clean.

On The Ark, the citizens demand to know what the pod was. Some yell that The 100 are just kids. Cece (Kelly Hu), speaking for the Council, will not confirm or deny anything.

On the pod, the Chancellor on the video explains that they are being deposited near Mount Weather, a military storage facility, built during the war, that is stocked with supplies to last 300 people up to 2 years.

A boy (Finn) has un-strapped himself from his position and is doing low-g acrobatics to the amusement of the others . . . except Clarke and Wells. The boy stops in front of Wells and says, Check it out. Your dad floated me after all. Wells is not amused. Two other boys have unstrapped themselves as well, and Clarke urges them to re-attach themselves. The pod's drag parachutes deploy and the pod's passengers are tossed about, especially those who aren't strapped in. They are thrown violently against the bulkheads, dismantling cables and conduit, resulting in blasts of steam and showers of sparks.

On The Ark, it's reported that the pod is off-course and in system failure. They have lost all means of communication except for the telemetry from the passengers wrist-bands. The 100 are on their own.

As it appears dire on the pod, Wells tells Clarke he has to tell her something. She says if it's about her father, that she won't listen to whatever he has to say.

The descent rockets kick in and the pod lands softly. One boy (Jasper) notices there are no machine noises, a first for all of them. The 100 unstrap themselves and move about. Finn (Thomas McDonell) is kneeling over one of the boys who had unstrapped himself. Clarke, kneeling next to another body, asks if the boy is still breathing and Finn shakes his head.

The 100 rush to the lower level where the main hatch is located. Clarke rushes down and urges them to stop the air outside may be toxic. An older boy (Bellamy) by the door reasons that if the air is toxic, they will soon be dead anyway. A girl climbing down the ladder sees the older boy and calls his name. She runs over and they hug. She asks, and he explains, he put on a guards uniform so he could get on the pod. They reveal they are brother and sister. Someone calls out that no one on The Ark has a sibling. Someone else calls out that the girl (Octavia) was the one they found hiding underneath the floorboards in one of the resident quarters. Octavia (Marie Avgeropoulos) runs to attack but Bellamy (Bob Morley) stops her. Instead, he lifts a latch and the hatch opens with a blast of steam. Everyone blinks from the bright sunlight, filtering through tall trees. Octavia takes a deep breath of the fresh air and steps out.

Everyone rushes out, including Clarke, who, studying a map of the terrain, determines that they landed far from Mount Weather. She looks up and sees the mountain on the near horizon. Finn comes up behind her, joking that they didn't die in a fiery explosion. She reminds him of the two dead boys who had followed Finn out of his seat. She then points out Mount Weather to Finn. She says its a long, radiation-soaked forest between them and their next meal.

In the control room on The Ark, an older well-coiffed man (Kane), Clarke's mom (Abby), and some scientists (including Jackson) are disappointed that they have lost contact with the pod because now, they cannot determine the conditions on Earth. However, individual screens on the wall of control room tell them the condition of The 100 based on the telemetry from the wristbands and they can use that information instead. They know two of The 100 have perished but reason that it was due to the violent landing. Kane (Henry Ian Cusick) notices that some of the telemetry screens are highlighted in red, indicating spiking vital signs. Abby thinks they may be injured from the landing, or are just excited to be on Earth.

Wells has taken a walk around the pod and tells Clarke they have problems : that they have no communication, and that heat shields on the top of the pod failed and the radio wires are fried. Clarke points to the map and shows him how far they are from Mount Weather. Jasper (Devon Bostic) looks over their shoulders and Wells grabs his arm and pushes him away. A humorless boy (Murphy) backed by a gang of thugs, comes up and tells Wells to back off. Wells tells them they have to figure out where they are. Bellamy, standing with Octavia, tells Wells all they need to know is that they are on the ground. Wells reminds them of the video they saw with the Chancellor, his father, urging them to get to the shelter and supplies at Mount Weather. Octavia says that Wells is not in charge and that they do not have to listen to what the Chancellor says. Clarke says they don't have to listen to what she or Wells or the Chancellor have to say, but they have to reach the food or it will become difficult for them very soon. They have to leave now to traverse the twenty miles before it gets dark. Bellamy suggests that Clarke and Wells, the privileged, go to Mount Weather and bring them back the supplies. Wells tells them they don't understand, that they ALL have to go, but Murphy (Richard Harmon) approaches him and kicks his feet out from under him. Wells slowly gets up and the two face each other, but Finn jumps in between the two, reminds Murphy that Wells has only one leg and that Murphy should wait until its a fair fight. Octavia steps in and flirts with Finn, and Murphy leads his gang away. Bellamy glares at Octavia and reminds her that Finn is a criminal. Octavia, in turn, reminds Bellamy that they are ALL criminals. He takes her aside and reminds her that he came down here to protect her. She says she does not need protection, and having been locked up for most of her life, she cant keep following orders and needs to be free. He whispers that he cannot stay with the group that he did something on The Ark in order to get on the pod, and they will kill him for it if and when the rest come down.

Finn asks Clarke and Wells when they are leaving for Mount Weather. Clarke says right away but Wells wonders how just the two of them can bring enough food for The 100. Finn turns around and recruits Jasper and Monty (Christopher Larkin). Octavia comes by and says shes joining them. Clarke notices Finns wristband is scratched up and he admits he tried to remove it. She says if he took it off, they will think he is dead. Finn says he doesn't care. Clarke asks him if he wants his loved ones on The Ark to think he is dead, or if he wants them to think the Earth is inhospitable and not come down. Bellamy looks on.

The group heads out. Clarke lags behind and tells Wells he should not have come down. When she catches up, Octavia tells Clarke that Finn belongs to her; Clarke says she doesn't care.

In the control room, Cece checks up on Abby. Abby is optimistic as Clarkes telemetry signs are good. Abby gets a call and she tells Jackson (Sachin Sahel) to bring blood plasma. Cece calls to Abby as she is running out and Abby explains that the Chancellor has been shot. Kane looks on.

The group walks on, gaping at the flora. As Finn picks a flower and puts it behind Octavias ear, Jasper is impressed that Finn has game. Monty is unimpressed saying that the flower is poison sumac (Octavia freaks and brushes it off her head), not actually poison but has medicinal purposes his parents are in charge of the pharmaceuticals on The Ark. Clarke urges them along and Finn wonders how she can block the beautiful scenery out. Clarke wonders why they haven't seen any animals and that maybe they have already been exposed to a lot of radiation.

As they continue, Finn asks the boys why they were imprisoned. Monty points out that sumac is not the only herb in The Ark garden. Jasper adds that Monty also forgot to replenish what they had taken from the garden. Jasper asks Octavia what she was busted for and she mumbles, for being born, and runs off to catch up with Clarke. They come upon a six-pointed deer and crouch down in awe to watch it feed. Finn steps on a twig and the animal turns to look at them it has one and a half faces on its deformed head.

The Chancellor is waking up on the operating table, mid-surgery, and Abby insists they increase his anesthesia. Jackson reminds her that they have already used the patient allotment of anesthesia and blood, so she goes to increase the dosage herself. Outside, Shumway (Terry Chen) reports to Kane that they've determined that the shooter was Bellamy Blake, a janitor. He has a sister who their mother kept hidden from them for sixteen years. Shumway reminds Kane that he, as Chancellor pro tempore, can start reducing The Ark population by the proposed 300 citizens immediately. Kane says, not yet, but Shumway reminds him that the removal of The 100 only bought them a months time, and that is not enough time for the engineers to find a way to extend their existence on The Ark, if they even can. Kane tells him to back off. In the meantime, Kane wants to know who helped Bellamy get on the pod surely there is another traitor around.

At the camp, Wells is gathering firewood. He sees that etched on the side of the pod is First Son, First to Dye. Murphy and a henchman come by. Clutching a knife, Murphy tells Wells that his father begged for mercy in the airlock chamber before Wells father floated him. Wells bumps him as he walks off, telling Murphy that he spelled Die wrong.

Bellamy has been watching this and sarcastically advises Murphy not to announce the fact that he plans to kill someone before he kills him. Bellamy tells them that they need to stop the authorities from coming down, that they would never forgive their crimes, and even if they do, they will always be second-class citizens. He recommends they remove their wristbands that The Ark will think them dead and that it is not safe to come down. Bellamy tells Murphy that the additional benefit is that he will make him his enforcer.

Abby returns to the control room and finds out Murphy and his henchmen have died. Kane thinks its from the radiation, but Abby says they wouldn't have died so quickly.

As the group continues, Finn wonders why the Council chose today to send them to ground. Octavia doesn't care, shes enjoying her freedom. Clarke says its because The Ark is dying that there is only three months left of life support, maybe four, now that The 100 has been sent down. Finn realizes that this information is why Clarke was imprisoned and her father, an engineer, was floated. Her father thought the citizens had the right to know but that the Council, and her mother, thought it would cause a panic. Monty hypothesizes that they will have to kill more citizens. Finn says they have to warn the citizens. Clarke looks at him and says that is what her father said.

Octavia has run off ahead, stands on top of a rock formation, and is taking off her clothes,. Down to her underwear, she jumps off. They catch up and see that she is shoulder-deep in a large river. Monty reminds her they cant swim, but she stands up, now waist-deep, and says they can stand. Clarke is alternately happy and confused there is not supposed to be a river there. Finn says that doesn't matter and tells her to take off her clothes. As Jasper undresses, he sees in the distance a disturbance in the water, and it is coming closer to where Octavia is wading. Despite his warnings, a large sea snake grabs her and drags her under water and disappears.

They look out over the river but only see calm waters. Suddenly Octavia pops up on their far right, still being dragged by the sea snake. Finn makes to get in, but Clarke holds him back and gets him to help her push a large rock into the water. It falls in, makes a large splash, and the sea snake lets go of Octavia and heads towards the distraction. Jasper dives in near Octavia. The sea snake comes back towards them but Jasper drags her on to the shore just in time. Octavia has a large bloody wound on her thigh but manages to hug Jasper. Clarke tears a strip from Jaspers shirt and makes a tourniquet. Monty pats Jasper on the shoulder and tells himself that next time, he will save the girl.

Wells hobbles out of the pod and hears primal yelling and screaming. The 100 are gathered around a bonfire, making a ceremony out of removing the wristbands. He confronts Bellamy, reminding the crowd that The Ark will think them dead and not follow down. Bellamy mockingly calls him Chancellor and says that is the point, and that they can take care of themselves. Wells says the people up there are not just their family and friends but their farmers and doctors and engineers as well. Wells asks if it is safe on Earth, how they can NOT want their people to come down. Bellamy says that HIS people are already there. And that the people up there locked HIS people up, and killed his mother for the crime of having a second child, which he blames on Wells father. Wells says his father didn't write the law, to which Bellamy retorts that here, there are no laws; and that here, they can do whatever the hell they want, which begins a chant among The 100. A thunderstorm breaks and Wells tells Bellamy they need to collect the rainwater. As The 100 dance in celebration, Bellamy replies, whatever the hell Wells wants.

In the control room, they see more of The 100 dying, however, Jackson also notices that plasma osmolality is going up, so they must have found water. Kane comes in with security and they arrest Abby for over-using the allotment of anesthesia and blood on the Chancellor. She says she broke the law and used whatever it took to keep the Chancellor alive, to keep Kane from becoming Chancellor. He takes this as a confession and says he has no choice but to find her guilty. She counters that there is always a choice like when Kane chose to press charges against her husband, resulting in his floating, and to include Clarke in the charges. Kane cites Penal Code 1 and sentences her death. He whispers to her that he chooses to do anything to keep the human race alive. She counters and says she chooses to do anything to make sure the human race DESERVES to stay alive.

Abby is put in the same cell Clarke was in. She notices Clarke's sketches.

Clarke wakes on the forest floor the group is all asleep around her and is fascinated by the bioluminescent flowers. Finn is also awake and has gone down to the river for a canteen of water. She drinks. Finn points out a footprint of something bipedal. She says shes read nothing about bipedal animals in that area.

Cece goes to Kanes quarters to plead for the life of her best friend. He says hes the only one who is willing to do what it takes to save humankind. Cece begs for mercy. Kane says they cant afford mercy.

Bellamy wakes Wells in the middle of the night and leads him into a clearing in the forest at gunpoint. Bellamy says he isn't going to shoot him but wants The 100 to think that he has. Bellamy wonders why Wells is behaving the way he is, since his father had banished him. He encourages Wells to take off the wristband. Wells refuses and Bellamy gives a signal whereby three thugs grab Wells, hold him down, and force off the wristband.

Abby is looking out the portal at Earth when the guards come to get her. She is dragged to an airlock. Cece hugs her. As the guards separate them, she asks Cece to watch over Clarke. Abby shrugs off the guards and walks in to the airlock herself. As the doors close, she tells Jackson to work with Sinclair to reverse engineer the wristbands to see if they can be used for communication. As Kane nods to Shumway, the Chancellor hobbles in and declares Abby pardoned. He tells Kane he will deal with him later and demands that Shumway open the door. Abby walks out and tells an orderly to take the Chancellor back to bed.

The group has to ford a wide gap over a ravine. Finn is on a precipice, holding on to a vine and is hesitant to swing across. Jasper encourages him but notices Octavia watching them. Jasper offers to go instead and Finn hands him the vine. Jasper makes it across to the cheers of the others and finds a deteriorating sign indicating Mount Weather. A spear comes from nowhere and pierces Jasper in the chest. The group crouches for cover. Clarke concludes that they are not alone."

Twilight Sparkle receives two tickets from Princess Celestia to the Grand Galloping Gala. When her friends find out, each of them wishes to go with her-

Applejack dreams of taking her farm's apple products to the Gala and making enough money to help her family out.


Rainbow Dash wants to use the Gala as a means to meet The Wonderbolts flying team (who are always in attendance).


Pinkie Pie wishes to go for the party and festivities.


Rarity wants to go in hopes of meeting (and possibly marrying) a handsome Prince.


Fluttershy wishes to go to view the castle gardens and its rare variety of plants and animals.


Each of Twilight's friends present plausible reasons to go, but Twilight is unable to decide just who should get her extra ticket. Each of them attempts to win her favor by offering her food or doing chores, but she grows more and more exasperated at their attempts.

Pinkie soon lets slip to the rest of Ponyville about Twilight's extra ticket, and soon everyone is clamoring for it. Twilight and Spike barricade themselves in her library, but her friends are already there, causing her to cry out that she can't decide, and doesn't want to on the basis that it will displease the others. When her friends see how upset she is, they give up their attempts.

Twilight then has Spike send the tickets back with a note to the Princess, saying she doesn't want to attend if her friends can't. Surprisingly, the Princess sends back a response, with enough tickets for all 6 of them to attend!"

After Applejack saves Ponyville from a stampede, the town's residents decide to throw a party in her honor for being such a helpful pony. On the day of the party, Applejack is presented with a large trophy, but some are perplexed when she seems a little tired out.

Twilight Sparkle stops by Sweet Apple Acres later on, and Applejack explains that Applebuck Season is upon the farm. Normally, both her and her older brother Big Macintosh would be doing the harvesting together, but since he has sustained an injury, she has taken it upon herself to harvest the farm's entire apple crop. Twilight claims she should get help, but Applejack refuses.

Due to her overworking, she ends up causing a number of small disasters:

Rainbow Dash asks Applejack to help her work on perfecting a new aerial trick, but ends up being flung into Twilight's treehouse.


Pinkie Pie requests Applejack's baking expertise when she is given the chance to run Sugarcube Corner. However, Applejack misinterprets directions for making muffins, and the end result ends up sickening a number of ponies in town.


Fluttershy asks Applejack and her dog Winona to help with the local 'bunny census,' but Applejack and Winona end upscaring the bunnies so bad, they end up stampeding through Ponyville, and eating up a number of flowers and plants in the town.


After the bunny stampede, Twilight goes to Applejack and demands she seek help harvesting the farm's crops. However, Applejack claims she's finished the harvest...until Big Macintosh points out that she's only harvested a fraction of the farm's crops. This realization causes Applejack to faint.

When she comes to, Twilight still offers to help her, and Applejack accepts her offer. Twilight recruits the rest of their friends, and they end up finishing the harvest. After they are finished, Applejack thanks them all, and apologizes for her stubborn personality causing her friends grief."

Edwards'],"['', '', '']",[],['mission'],[],"The episode starts with President Kirkman (Kiefer Sutherland) in bed, waking up at 4:45 to here his cell phone giving him an alert to go to command ops. After making his way down, he is informed of the fact that Majid Nassar is in a compound near a village and that America has the chance to launch an air strike. President Kirkman doesn't give the order at first, questioning if the blast will kill anyone from a nearby village. After being told that it would be good but he only has 10 minutes before their window will be closed, he gives the go-ahead to blow up the compound. Just before the Jets take off, Command Ops receives new intelligence, telling them that someone from the Algerian Government has tipped of Nassar, who has left.

Kimble confronts the President to deliver her fears on why Car Park H (2-star Generals and up only) was full at 5 AM and asks if they are going to war. She reminds him of his duty to tell Congress if he is going to take military action against anyone.

Military intelligence finds Nassar hiding in the basement of an Algerian hospital, which means that an airstrike is not an option as too many civilians would die. President Kirkman and his Commander of the Joint Chiefs meet in the Oval Office to talk about how to deal with Nassar, with the option of sending in a SEAL Team in the one that the CotJC think is the best. Kirkman demands to go talk to the leader of the team that would be going into Algeria and flies to Little Creek, Virginia.

Aaron briefs Seth on what to say in the press meeting at the White House that is about to start, informing him not to mention anything about an upcoming military strike. Despite the mission being Top Secret, all the press know and badger Seth with questions about what is to happen. Seth tries to redirect the conversation topic to something else to no avail, and so eventually ends the conference.

Max, the commander of the Seal Team, talks to POTUS (President of the United States) about the chances of succeeding in the mission. The commander says that it is a 50/50 chance, but he's confident that they'll get the job done. After reassuring Kirkman, POTUS green-lights the mission.

Kirkman heads to DC to meet with the Congress (a.k.a Kimble and Peter MacLeish) to brief them on the Algeria Mission. Peter gives his support, while Kimble warns him that she will turn her back on him should the mission fail. Aaron speaks to Kirkman after the meeting and recommends Peter for Speaker of the House (a position that Kimble is after) once Congress is actually full, with Tom telling Aaron to get to work on it.

Hannah Wells (Maggie Q) is following up on the tip from last episode (Room 105). After digging around and making a deal with Kimble (to keep her informed of her findings for the blueprints to the most recent renovation of the Capitol). She finds that room 105 was renovated by a contractor that hadn't been used before, that Kimble hasn't heard of and that has closed within two months of the renovation. She finds that Peter MacLeish was found in the rubble of Room 105.

Aaron and Emily (Italia Ricci) approach Peter for the role of Speaker of the House. However, Peter turns them down (saying ""Speaker of the House is pure politics... I'm not interested in power for power's sake""). He says that he is honored, but that being Speaker would prevent him from serving the American people.

With help from Kimble, Hannah finds out that the 8 men who worked room 105, only to discover that they have all died within the last two months since completing work on the room. Further probing leads to the discovery that they had built 105 as a bomb shelter, with Peter knowing about it and going to it before the bombing took place. Hannah takes this all to Jason (her boss at the FBI) who finally believes her but tells her not to tell anyone else (as they ""don't know who to trust"")

As Hannah gathers more evidence, Peter gains more access to POTUS, who invites Peter to the Situation Room to watch the mission via video feed. The SEAL team loses a chopper, with Denton becoming injured so that he can't go on with the mission. Max says that they have a suitable replacement for him though to carry on with the task at hand. The SEALs make their way through the hospital and make it to the basement, where they find Nassar and some of his men, who have taken several children hostage. During the fight (in which the Situation Room loss to the feed (much to POTUS's anger)) the SEALSs manage to apprehend Nassar alive, but Max dies while shielding two children from the gunfire.

POTUS talks to Denton at Max's coffin, who tells him that Max wasn't meant to go on the mission and was meant to stay at the Helicopter Landing Zone, but replaced himself [Denton] when he became injured in the emergency landing of the chopper. Tom starts to blame himself (using the fact that Max told him it was only a 50/50 chance and that he should have waited for better odds), although Denton

Later that night, Kirkman walks in on Emily, Aaron and Seth eating dinner and learns that Peter turned down Speak of the House because he didn't come to DC for power, something POTUS says he can relate to and respects Peter for. Because of this, Tom suggests that Peter may be better suited to take on the vice presidency, ending the episode."

The two get into a brawl outside and Nate's father punches him which attracts the attention of the police. Nate says he wants to press charges. Nate finds out that the Captain's bail is set at 1 million dollars as the police have discovered the Captain has been embezzling from work. Afterwards, Nate gets ready to go see Chuck at the strip club he opened, but Blair stops him and tells him he needs to be with his father. Blair tells Nate that she doesn't need him and they break up and she heads over to the strip club saying she wants to ""escape"", which leads to the beginning of the relationship between Blair and Chuck in the backseat of his limousine."

Miller Tobin'],"['', '', '']",[],"['new york city', 'manhattan new york city', 'upper east side manhattan new york city']",[],"Previously on Gossip Girl -- Blair loves Nate, Jenny loves popularity, Lily loves Rufus but is loathe to admit it, Rufus *really* loves Lily, Serena loves Dan and hates Chuck, Lily loves being proposed to by Chuck's dad, Serena *really* loves to hate Chuck, Chuck taunts but secretly loves Blair, Jenny loves attention from Nate, Blair hates her life falling down around her as Jenny ascends to Queen Bee status, Blair and Serena love each other enough to be good friends after so much fighting.

There -- caught up now after three months? Whew! XOXO!

""Moon River"" plays, Blair is Holly Golightly looking for her orange cat (though did Audrey Hepburn ever say ""Ew!"" in the alleyway?), and Nate is doing total George Peppard action, down to the sixties hair. (Flashback for the uninitiated and/or lazy - Breakfast at Tiffanys is Blair's fave film.) Sadly, reality imposes upon Blair's dream and Gossip Girl informs us that spring break is over, over. Blair's BFF is Lady Godiva (as in chocolate), and must be dragged out of bed to school.

Serena and Chuck, apparently step-siblings, are doing a post-modern interpretation of the Brady Bunch kids-sharing-a-bathroom dance, however Chuck's guests are not Peter and Bobby, but his female guests from the previous evening. Turns out he's joking about the girls, but not about getting high. Serena is appropriately disgusted, and leaves without showering (something everyone notices through the day).

Meanwhile, on the way to school, Jenny is playing total Queen Bee with Blair's former clique -- it's just like ""The Golden Girls"" or ""Designing Women"" where everyone wears a different color to offset each other, down to the headbands. Jenny is playing it up that she has a fab couture outfit for her upcoming birthday dinner, but her insecurity belies her pretense at excellent financial and fashion status.

Meanwhile, Eric (still frosting his hair) is gawking in the stairway, hiding from his valet, who wanted to put his socks on for him -- apparently, the new domestic state of the combined Bass-Van der Woodsen families is wearing on the non-Bass kids. Ah -- everyone is cohabitating, but no marriage has happened, as Chuck's dad asks Chuck to be best man. Should be easy, since Chuck is kissing up to Lily big time and alienating his soon-to-be siblings.

Dan (in schoolboy uniform) is back from spring break, eating breakfast with Rufus, who informs him that Jenny is now hobnobbing on private planes and having a grand old time. Rufus (in worn out gray tshirt - still looking great) tells him he's late for school, and aspiring writer Dan makes a break for it.

Cut to B and S - S is rocking out some great leather, B looks like a matron coming back from the salon, white sunglasses and kerchif hiding her personality. S brings B up to speed on her pals, and gets B to remove the disguise. Uh oh, Blair must now face her schoolmates, who gawk and gape and get to see her coated with Yoplait (thanks, Jenny!).

Nate corners Jenny in the schoolyard, and warns her about her new supposed friends, who have turned on Blair and according to him would be more than happy to turn on Jenny. Romantic foreshadowing -- Nate tells Jenny she's not like the other girls! BTW, Nate's bangs have not been cut in three months.

Blair and Serena convene on the Metropolitan Museum of Art steps again, but it's just the two of them, being brave. Then, Chuck and Eric (!) appear, as male BFFs, which irritates Serena to no end. Blair is irritated watching Jenny hold court, and is further peeved that Jenny is getting taken to dinner by the clique girls. Serena basically tells her to be nice and everything will happens in its own time. Blair is.... less than comforted.

Jenny is troubled again having to pretend to be rich, and using her wiles, tries to get out of another expensive night she cannot afford.... by marching up to Blair! AND, she invites her to Butter! (If you don't know about Butter, please start reading New York magazine *right now*) Serena says yes for Blair.

OMG - Dan and Serena are making out at (her) home! Chuck interrupts that the wedding caterer is here with a tasting menu, and invites Dan to stay. Nice, or.... a motive involved? Serena gets a surprise package - it's porn and handcuffs! How thoughtful! She assumes it's from Chuck, he denies, Dan removes the offending material.

Spotted - Blair alone at Butter at a huge table. Turns out Jenny tricked her! The clique girls are at someone's upscale home. Jenny thrusts and parries at questions about what expensive clothes she'll wear to her party, saved by a phone call from her dad. Rufus wants to take her out to dinner, but plays along nicely when she says she wants to be with friends... but the sad music says she might want to be with dad instead of pretending to be fab tomorrow night.

Blair, alone at Butter, puts on the best face possible with the staff.... and then pulls out her phone. Is the bitch back?

Next day, Jenny's at a consignment store -- it's apparent she's been there more than once. She has clothes to sell... but are they hers, or one of her friend's? In exchange, she wants a her own hot outfit.

In the Bass limo, Eric is playing Mini-Me to Chuck's Dr. Evil. Chuck's dad is dubious about the situation, and after Eric leaves, Dad berates him for the porn-and-handcuffs stunt (which Chuck denies again) and then offers him $$$ to keep things copacetic for the wedding. A deal is made.

B and S are talking on the phone - B sez she's not coming in (something to help those less fortunate - ha!) but in reality she's at Rufus' gallery. Back at school, Serena is presented with three cases of champagne, delivered. She leaves it for the kids, and is obviously unnerved at the present. Chuck is intrigued!

OMG - someone stole a couture dress from one of Jenny's friend's moms! Could it be the same dress Jenny just sold at her fave consigment store? As the Magic 8-Ball would say, Signs point to yes! If the dress doesn't get returned, a poor maid could go to jail.

Blair is trying to make trouble with Rufus over Jenny -- B has her sweetest smile on, but manipulation is the name of the game. Rufus counterplays with suggestions of Jenny's servitude to Blair. Blair accepts the maneuver and implies poor Jenny needs help with her new pals. Check, but not checkmate.

Jenny tries to get the stolen/sold dress back so someone you've never seen on the show won't get into trouble. Failing to do so, she calls... Nate! Can she borrow $8000? Nate balks, she hangs up, he's intrigued....

Back at the Bass-Van der Woodsen residence, Lily asks Serena if she has reservations about the upcoming wedding, prompted by the mysterious delivery of champagne at school (thanks, schoolmistress, for blabbing!). Serena vehemently denies, and blames Chuck... just as Chuck's dad walks in assuming the worst.

OMG again - Jenny comes home to Brooklyn, and all her pals are at her loft with Rufus for a low-budget party.... not only is there a tacky cake waiting, but Blair appears to be the one to have arranged it all! Cut to B with a smug smile. Jenny puts on a brave face, but is horrified a la Molly Ringwald in Pretty in Pink that her friends have now seen where she lives.

Blair listens on as Jenny's ""friends"" induct this so-called party into the ""birthday hall of lame."" Blair now looks like she has devoured two canaries, with frosting.

Serena and Dan are sharing a thermos of coffee outside wearing trendy scarves. Nate (!) interrupts, asking to speak with..... Dan? Nate is all like concerned over Jenny and the big money request. Dan is good big brother and willing to investigate.

Cut to Jenny trying to get out of her stolen couture outfit as Rufus tries to help. The clique friends walk in... and see that Jenny is wearing the one-of-a-kind Valentino that magically disappeared from somebody's mom's closet. Blair swoops in, devours a third canary, and invites the brood to Butter. Jenny is left humiliated in her (wait for it) red dress! So Scarlett O'Hara, all the way up here in Brooklyn!

Rufus and Jenny are having dad-daughter time; Rufus reveals Blair's machinations, and then demands to know where the red dress came from. Jenny gives it back to him, telling him how difficult it is to be a brown-bagger in a rich world, and that it means she may have no friends. (Translation: It's harder out here for a Brooklyn girl than it is for a pimp!)

Nate bids Serena a chaste good night in front of her hotel, just as Eric walks up after a mysterious four-hour disappearance. The frosted locks are no cover for his excuses, and he gives Serena a line about how great Chuck is, how he doesn't treat him like damaged goods. Eric gives Serena a present supposedly from Chuck... it's cocaine! Eric is shocked... or is he?

Dan's back in Brooklyn, seeing the ruins of Jenny's birthday-from-hell. He plays good brother, but asks about the $8K. Jenny reveals the she-thought-she-could-fool-them-all plan. Dan offers ice cream. Didn't we just see cocaine about 30 seconds ago? Brooklyn is indeed a world apart.

Serena confronts Chuck, who is wearing a strange whale-knit cardigan that must be seen to be believed. She throws the coke at him, and he reveals he's been kicked out, for the good of their soon-to-become family. Both are slightly confused, like whales on a cardigan.

At Butter, Blair is unwilling to give up her table (again) when her clique pals show up to keep her company - B is now Queen Bee again!

Rufus and Dan argue about whether Jenny should be grounded - spring break is, like, officially over now! Dan goes to get Jenny for some cake, but the blonde minx has disappeared... to Nate's, no less. She asks for a favor -- not money, just not to be alone on her birthday. Sweet, yet a tiny bit creepy.

Back at the Bass-Van der Woodsen ranch, Serena tries to make amends with Eric, who rebuffs her. Just then, an urgent letter is hand-delivered to her... dramatic music rises.... ""Oh my god,"" says Serena, who leaves immediately.

Back at Butter, Jenny crashes Blair's table, with Nate in tow. Seeing Jenny's prize catch, the clique girls turn a blind eye to Jenny's Valentino dress theft, while Blair upchucks her previously eaten canaries.

At Chuck's suite, a knock on the door heralds Serena, who apologizes for accusing Chuck of the champagne-porn-cocaine deliveries. A handwritten note reveals it's all thanks to someone named ""G"" -- ""Hope you like your presents! Coming back to town."" Chuck somberly and sympathetically offers S a drink - we might all need one for the upcoming drama..."

Flashback: Blair and Nate are in love, then break up. Flash to now: Jenny threatens Blair's status as queen bee. And the mysterious ""G"" is behind Serena's recent receipt of champagne, cocaine, and porn with handcuffs.

Now - back to the present.

Everyone is seen angsting -- about the SATs? Did we drop into geek territory? Seriously, everyone is studying: Serena with coffee, Blair with her maid, the wannabes are enamored of their test pens, Chuck (wearing an orange overcoat stolen from Posh Spice's closet) enlists an African American cutie to take his place during testing. Of course, Dan is the only one actually really studying, pulling his hair oh-so-photogenically. Rufus pops in (having had a Brooklyn spa day, it appears) to remind his son that time's up on his faux SAT. Perfect-pores Rufus is also intent on escorting Jenny to school, since she's been up to slightly devious shenanigans. Jenny appreciates the parent-child bonding, but in keeping with channeling Molly Ringwald a la Pretty in Pink, doesn't want her friends to see her dad.

At school, Serena and Blair are comparing and constrasting their pals' college-bound credentials; Blair *must* take out Nellie Yuki, because she's the highest-scoring student but mostly because she likes saying ""Nellie Yuki."" Chuck appears again in Posh Spice's orange overcoat, Blair disappears, Chuck is surprisingly cordial to Serena. He informs her that Georgina (that would be ""G"") is nowhere near the fair isle of Manhattan, according to his sources. Serena is totally relieved, Chuck waxes nostalgic about how Georgina brought out the old sexy Serena, S politely rebuffs and reminds him about the impending SATs.

Jenny is getting an earful from her upperclasswomen about how she's lucky not to have to take the SATS; everyone is ridiculously accessorized to the max, like they fell onto the Bluefly.com accessory wall from Project Runway. Jenny offers to help, but Blair sweeps in offering a study night, which sounds more like a spa night with massages, pedicures, and round the clock facial treatments.

Serena and Dan meet up in the school yard, exchange smooches and promises to study together when -- OMG, is Sunnydale invading Manhattan?! Michelle Trachtenberg, in oversize sunglasses and Eurotrash style to max, sidles up behind S, insinuating dirty thoughts! She is like totally Georgina! Serena is agape.

Georgina inquires about the gifts, asks if S missed her, offers her a date for a cocktail to catch up. Georgina's vibe is slightly predatory, a tiny bit desperate, and totally hinting at girl-on-girl friendliness that comes with a price; it's as if we've dropped into a Jacqueline Susann novel all of a sudden! (If you are too young to know who that is, Wikipedia her right now and order your copy of Valley of the Dolls - so much fun!) Serena looks like she's seen a ""ghost of parties past"" as Dawn -- I mean, Georgina! -- trots off to cause trouble elsewhere.

Back to Jenny, who meets with a kindergartner who apparently goes to her school - a short cohort in a hot pink overcoat (Posh Spice's also?) who offers to help Jenny find the right boyfriend. Many suitors are rejected when a cutie dogwalker bumps into her; he looks even younger than Jenny if that is possible. He proffers a phone number (smooth operator for 14!) and is on his way. Jenny does so not want a dog walker - sorry!

Nate shows up at the cafe where Vanessa (remember her?) works, where Dan is SAT studying and Vanessa is tutoring him while working on her video project (remember that?); Nate, BTW, appears to be wearing a pajama top under his blazer. Nate is offering numerous SAT books, which Vanessa kindly rebuffs -- in reality, it's a mask for coy flirtation. Nate and his pajama top depart, Vanessa checks out some notes Nate left tucked in the pages, and is intrigued!

It's nighttime now, Serena and Georgina are chatting over cosmos; Serena tries to say she's so not into the past fun and games, Georgina promises fun and games like old times but without the nasty repercussions. Serena waffles, promises one drink - uh oh! Down the path S goes....

The wannabes show up at Blair's -- where's the SAT spa they were promised? Blair is a symphony of polka dots, and her mission is to get her pals to take down Nellie Yuki, find her weakness and exploit it. Once done, spa time is theirs.

S and G are remembering good old times -- S seems very drunk while G is in control. Two guys pop over (if you watch As the World Turns, one of them is Noah, of Luke and Noah, the hot-young-pioneering-gay-male-couple-of-daytime-drama), while S pretends to be Southern and G pretends to be Greek (nice nod to Blake Lively's Traveling Pants films!). A call comes in - it's Georgina's dealer! S is pissed, G is irked because S is pissed, S makes an emergency call to Chuck for a rescue. Chuck obliges after some verbal wordplay, while wearing a green-and-white-striped sweater, plaid shirt, AND pink tshirt!

Chuck calls.... Dan? While Chuck puts on a jerky act, he's really giving Serena a nice out from her study date with Brooklyn Dan, saying S is sick with food poisoning. Dan buys it.

Next morning at school, Chuck has traded his orange overcoat for a red-magenta one. Dan stalks up to him, asking why is Serena so weird -- must be Chuck, eh? S walks up -- uh oh, she pops a migraine story, not a food poisoning one. She covers nicely but not perfectly. Dan pushes it, but she's totally saved by the bell. Dan is angsty, S confides to Chuck that she's miserable, Chuck says, um, tell him about Georgina! Serena, not being wise with the insight, says no way.

Focus on Nellie Yuki, cornered by the wannabes. Blair is orchestrating a pressurization of the perfect student, but Nellie balks until... they find a weakness! (Blair is wearing perfect white gloves, argyle, plaid, a tie AND a striped hairband) Turns out Nellie's boyfriend broke up with her and she's still a mess over it. Blair downloads the product-placed song that reminds Nellie of her old BF - thanks, Verizon Wireless!

Jenny and her Mini-Me are still scheming to find her a boyfriend when they come across adorable Dog Walker Boy again. Uh oh, turns out he's not the walker -- he's the owner! Jenny is pleased, and makes her move.

Back to Blair -- she finds poor Nellie, plays the hurtful song that makes Nellie goes to pieces, and gets the uber-genius to open up to her. Blair is faux-sympathetic, gets the name of Nellie's ex, and invites poor Nellie over for catharsis at her penthouse. Hmmm... Nellie wants to be focused for the SATs, but Blair puts on the nicey-nice act to get her competition in a weakened state.

Vanessa is in Brooklyn in a trendy diner waiting for.... Nate? He's late, she's cute about it, and she's surprised he knows the place. Turns out Nate's dad is in rehab close by... bonding music swells as she looks at him in a different light. Nate says he and his eyebrows come to the cafe for decompression, Vanessa sympathizes... turns out she's read an essay of his he left in one of his SAT books, and is apologizing for treating him like a superficial rich kid. They smile.

G calls S -- G wants to make up, she sees S has changed, says she's an inspiration. We sense duplicity in the air, and the music accompanying the scene confirms our suspicions. Serena says she can't, can't, can't meet for dinner (SATs, you know), but Georgina promises only an hour. Serena waffles (again), says yes to the dinner invite, Gossip Girl tells us that (surprise!) it might be a big mistake.

Back in Brooklyn, Dan is cramming for the SATs and bugging Jenny. Rufus returns home, Jenny is super-perfect daughter with homework all done, dad rewards her with a sewing machine, which she sold to get fashion clothes for school. Sadly, she's still grounded, but wants to meet Dog Walker/Owner Boy. When Rufus says nyet, Jenny storms off.

At SAT Spa Central (aka Blair's pad), B leaves a message for S, who is a no show. Nellie Yuki is getting a massage when in walks.... Nellie's ex-boyfriend! The two awkwardly engage.... the boyfriend apologizes and wants to talk. Nellie is happy and thanks Blair, who, um, *might* have an ulterior motive! Oxygen facials, everyone!

OMG - Nate and Vanessa went out on a date! With live music! In Brooklyn! They start bonding, Vanessa tells him about her non-college dreams and her aspirations of being a filmmaker. They say goodnight....romantic music swells.... Nate and his cheekbones get closer to Vanessa.... she giggles... OMG redux, they totally kiss! Multiple times!

Back in Manhattan, S and G are dining out, with Diet Coke instead of cosmos. G grills Serena about Dan, Serena spills her heart and guts, sweetly, and Georgina seems actually affected. As Serena goes to call Dan, it's revealed - Georgina's putting on an act for certain. And then, she totally spikes Serena's Diet Coke! Drama is in the making! A toast is proposed to the ""new Serena"".... cut to commercial break!

It's got to be the morning after, when Serena wakes up....at Georgina's hotel room?! S is totally confused, and panicked that she's missing the SATs. G offers eggs for breakfast and reveals how S went from Diet Coke to Patron in a heartbeat; also she covered for her pal with Lily. G spins a tale of debauchery and men while playing the good helpful friend. Serena is like totally freaked... and calls Chuck!

In Brooklyn again, Vanessa runs into Nate, who offers to whisk her away somewhere on a one-time-only date. Vanessa is intrigued -- and actually says so! (We are validated!)

Jenny and Rufus are eating breakfast, tense-fully. They finally have it out - Jenny is angry that dad won't let her go see Asher (aka, Dog Walker/Owner Boy) and that she has totally learned her lesson, so let her see the cute boy, OK? Rufus says no way, while wearing a bad collar-less button-up shirt. Frowny faces all around.

Turns out Nate's secret date for Vanessa is.... the SATs! Since she's a genius at helping Dan, shouldn't she take the test herself to see if she does good and might want to go to college sometime? She screws her courage to her number-two pencil sticking place and charges in.

Oh no -- after a whole night of talking, Nellie Yuki confides to Blair that she and her old boyfriend might not get back together! Blair is like totally sad (ha!) and gloats as she hears Nellie got no sleep. As Nellie goes in to take the test, Blair reveals her secret weapon -- she's just stolen the batteries from Nellie's calculator!

At the SATs, Blair and Dan have a nice moment over trying to find Serena. As Blair leaves, Dan overhears a youngish redhead checking in as ""Serena van der Woodsen."" Uh-oh! We smell Chuck somewhere close by....

Flash forward to the end of the SATs -- Blair (who appears to have undergone a hairstyle change while taking her test) and Dan reconvene re Serena, and Dan, wearing his Rufus-style I-am-disappointed face, says he might know where to find her. Adding insult to injury for both Blair and Dan, the two spy Vanessa and Nate embracing! It's a total WTF moment for the two pals-of-Serena.

Dan finds Serena, but instead of getting hostile, he goes into sensitive guy mode and begs her to tell him what's going on. Chuck, a symphony of bad golf-outfit colors, pops in on the moment, as Serena pulls the food-poisoning act again. Dan counterplays with the I-saw-someone-checking-in-as-you-to-take-the-test factoid, Chuck says it was his idea, Dan is *so* sensitive that he says he's not mad and asks Serena to please, please, PLEASE tell him what's what. When she won't, he finally, sensitively, breaks.... now he is really disappointed! And leaves.

Chuck reads the situation and nicely (for him) asks Serena what Georgina has on her that she won't even tell Dan about it. Serena won't say.

At G's suite, S shows up, saying do not EVER contact her again! (Nice white scarf there, Serena!) S confronts her on the shenanigans, but owns her badness. G pushes her on how bad a girl S can be, while Serena's strong facade slowly cracks.... a threat by Serena is issued, ""If I go down, you go down with me."" The two bitchily agree to stay apart.... but Georgina's face says revenge is the order of the day.

In Brooklyn, Asher shows up at the Humphrey loft, bearing food as a gift. Jenny is touched, Rufus is confused, Asher totally plays the perfect prince and Rufus melts.

In Central Park, Dan is brooding when an adorable golden retriever runs up to him chasing a ball. Turns out the sweet doggie is owned by..... Georgina! G plays cute, Dan plays funny, sparks are ignited, and then G introduces herself.... as ""Sarah""!

Teased for next week -- Serena's secret is leaked, and the long-anticipated ""gay bomb"" drops!"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1122272/?ref_=ttep_ep16,,"Blair and Jenny escalate their ""popularity war"" by spreading scandalous rumors about each other through Gossip Girl.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Janice Cooke'],"['', '', '']",[],"['new york city', 'manhattan new york city', 'upper east side manhattan new york city']",[],"Previously on Gossip Girl: Jenny wants a boyfriend, a cute guy named Asher. Serena's little brother Eric tried to kill himself, evil Georgina returns to haunt Serena, and Serena will NOT tell anyone what Georgina has on her. Meanwhile, Georgina introduces herself to Dan as ""Sarah.""

On the steps of the Met, Jenny and Blair stare daggers at each other while comparing and contrasting various internet/blog rumors that may or may not be true (Gossip Girl is irked that her sources may not be pure). Yes, everyone is color coordinated within an inch of their lives. Jenny's having a party at Asher's (my, she works fast!) that Blair is so not invited to. Blair tries to cut her down, but the party planner rings up Jenny. (OMG, Jenny is totally wearing fishnet stockings -- what would Rufus say?!) Ha! Turns out it's Rufus on the phone, Jenny says she's going to ""choir practice"" and evades, asking is dinner okay tomorrow, dad? Jenny returns to the group with faux party stories, just as Asher-y boy arrives in a car that James Bond might own. Blair eats chocolate cake with a frowny face.

Serena and Eric are leaving the Palace Hotel - Eric contrasts a plaid shoulder strap with a striped tie, while Serena sports Sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts-club vest under a great leather coat. Eric brings up all the Gossip Girl rumors floating around, Serena laughs off the rumor that *he* was GG (nice nod to the outside world!), but Eric is all evasive when Chuck calls S. He's all concerned she's heard from Georgina, but she says she's ok....

But then, Georgina is at Vanessa's coffee shop, where she's playing faux-naif to NYC, and thanks Vanessa and Dan for ""adopting"" her. It's total sweet action, where they dissect Jenny's crush on Asher and G plays dumb over Dan's girlfriend, someone named.... Serena? G is dying to meet this wonderful Serena as menacing music plays. Maybe tonight?

Back at school, Eric is eyeing Jenny and Asher as they smooch, and pulls Jenny over for a private discussion. He's all stalkery about her not returning calls, Jenny giggles and apologizes, then gushes about her new boytoy as Eric seethes. ""How well do you know him?"" Eric gloweringly asks. Jenny thinks he's being sweet, but it's way too creepy. Does Eric have a crush on Jenny? Um, something tells us that's not the story here.

Dan finds Serena, they smooch, he invites her to get together tonight. They banter (apparently last week's falling-out was minor) and Serena begs off on plans for an actual real SAT tutor session. Dan counters with ""dinner with Sarah"" but they try for something else. Meanwhile, Dan's a little frowny face over Jenny's new boyfriend. Serena says to lighten up.

G (with black nail polish) is watching as Dan exits, and Dan spys Asher making out with someone... OMG, a guy? He falls back, watches and waits, ducks back... but misses who it is Asher's been canoodling with.

At the Palace, Lily is making arrangements with the wedding planner when... Rufus shows up! Lily plays cool, but Rufus is looking for mom-style advice re Jenny. Lily relents.

Dan confronts Asher with the fact that he saw Asher kissing... a guy! Asher plays all butch, saying ""Are you calling me queer?"" Dan doesn't bat an eye and says yes (in full sensitive guy mode). Asher overcompensates with nasty comments about Jenny, who intervenes. Asher pivots with some suave invites, Jenny gets all defensive, Dan is left with no way to say what he knows. Jenny and Asher stalk away, Dan is befuddled.

S and B are conferencing on the Met Steps; B needs quality time, S is busy. Then Dan shows up, worried about Jenny. He spills that he's worried about Jenny, Blair's ears perk up for useful knowledge. Serena plays nicey-nice, saying give Jenny space.

Rufus and Lily are at her wedding dress boutique. Parent-child advice ensues (OMG, Rufus is reading Jenny's email), and Lily tells Rufus that raising girls is way tougher than raising boys. Jenny will come back to him, Lily says. Rufus plays gallant and slips a bracelet on Lily's wrist for her. Sweetness ensues.

OMG - Gossip Girl is rocking everyone's Verizon Wireless with the fact that Asher prefers boys, not girls! Comments about Vanessa Hudgens' feelings are bandied about to Jenny, and Blair comes around the corner, ready to pounce on Jenny's supposed humiliation. Blair says the guy-on-guy rumors are not her doing, Jenny says ha!

Serena gets a call from the hotel; a package is awating her from Georgina! She tells the concierge hold it until her arrival from school. As she dashes, Blair unwillingly walks up to Dan, calling him ""dirty."" She thinks he's outed Jenny's boyfriend. He denies, but he spills his knowledge of Asher's previous makeout session. Blair wants proof, since Gossip Girl is not the best source of late. (In addition to the Vanessa-Hudgens-Has-a-Gay-Boyfriend innuendo, we now get a Katie Holmes reference!) Dan does not want Jenny to get hurt, Blair says something mean with the word ""hag"" involved, Dan tells her she's on her own.

Back to Rufus and Lily - they're reminiscing as he suddenly sees her in her wedding dress. His breath is literally taken away. She's touched but wary. He's regretful. She apologizes - are we friends? He says yes, but there are total feelings there.

Jenny's at school, S rushes by as the wannabes quiz Jenny on how far she's gone with Asher. Jenny wavers, the girls continue in, Jenny plays it well (third base - really?) but not perfectly.

Blair's spies somehow manage to get Asher's cell phone -- apparently the boy takes inordinately long showers after lacrosse practice. B conveniently gets all cell phone messages to be forwarded to her. We likey!

Jenny surprises Asher at his mansion before the big party and totally starts sticking her tongue down his throat. He's freaked - or so we think. Then, he tells her how's he keeping up his part of the bargain by offering poor little Brooklyn Jenny status, entree into society, access, resources... in return, she needs to know what she gives him. Asher is being totally mean -- is what Gossip Girl said true? He pulls entitlement, saying to keep up the ruse (though he doesn't say exactly what it is) so she can throw her first Upper East Side party. Jenny is crushed but when Asher says they have to put those ""rumors"" to rest, she sadly asks what she need to do.

S is back at the Palace Hotel - G's gift is a video, apparently. S plugs the flash drive into her laptop -- G and an unknown man are setting up a video camera to record Serena. It's something sexual involving a ""Mr and Mrs Shepherd"" - we can tell from the audio (no video is seen) that S is being coerced somehow. Serena freaks, locks the flash drive in a drawer. As Serena's leaving, she runs into Lily -- turns out Georgina just invited herself to a quiet van der Woodsen family dinner! S is so totally screwed.

Back in Brooklyn, Gossip Girl is totally insinuating that Jenny lost her virginity to Asher! Dan is angry, apparently being on GG's mailing list. He counters her on the whole Asher-being-gay thing, she realizes he saw Asher making out with a boy, Dan asks why is she doing this? He's the voice of reason, she accuses him of being judgemental AND sending tips to Gossip Girl. Get out of my room, nosy big brother!

Blair calls Serena, who can't take the call due to family dinner. Eric is being a little snot, Georgina asks Lily about her wedding plans, G butters up Lily about the impending nuptials. S is unhappy, Eric is smug, Georgina..... uh-oh! She totally outs Eric at the dinner table! SHE saw Eric making out with a guy! She plays like it's cool, but then fake-realizes she's made a mistake.... Lily won't acknowledge that her son might be.... she can't say it. She asks, Eric won't answer and leaves the table, Serena chastises Georgina, who's smug as a bug in a rug.

Jenny's leaving for choir practice... but Rufus calls her on the Asher party. He tells her she's not going. Arguments ensue, as well as threats. She is so not a little girl anymore! Sadly, she's lost his trust.... does she want to lose his respect too? The stakes are too high for Jenny -- she goes, crushing Rufus.

Back at the Palace, Serena goes in to see Eric, trying to make things right. Both are sad that he couldn't tell her he's gay, and that she didn't make the time to connect with him. Eric says he's OK, but Serena says she's there for him. Despite the emotional mess both are in, he admits Asher's his boyfriend, Serena says she's proud of him, they hug. She vows to stand by his side - but Eric says he has to stop by Asher's party. Someone is there he needs to talk to!

Asher's party is a riot of Upper East Side glitz by way of MySpace -- with LOTS of plaid. Blair is seen arriving/crashing -- looking GREAT in a dress and pearls Daisy Buchanan would kill to own. (If you don't know who that is, buy The Great Gatsby *right now*!) She warns the wannabes something big is about to happen, then goes to find the host. Everyone is intrigued!

Serena (in a great minidress) has apparently found her way to Brooklyn and Vanessa's coffee shop - Dan is there, glad that she can finally meet Sarah. S says this is not the time.... but guess who's *right there*? Sarah/Georgina! It is SO NICE to finally meet you, Serena! Serena is shocked to the core, Georgina plays her part perfectly....she's an aspiring filmmaker like Vanessa, and has a ""short film"" she'd like to show the Brooklyn crew. Would S like to view as well? Serena sends Dan away, confrontation ensues. G says it's like old times, S is saying this is so not old times and they are so not friends! G counters with.... well, if they're enemies, Dan sees the video. S backpedals, G pockets the ""short film,"" Serena escapes unscathed... for now.

At the party, Jenny's going on about how great Asher is when the wannabes inform her Blair is there! B strides up to Asher, taps him on the shoulder a la Les Liaisons Dangereuses and infoms him they need to talk! (Love how she did it with a cell phone and not a fan!) Asher relents - it's his phone she's tapping him with. He's cool as he asks her what she's going to do with her evidence, and Blair shows the one little piece of her heart, saying she won't expose what she knows because she cares about who's involved. Just then, Eric (said person involved who's cared for) enters, confronts Asher, who is aghast. (By the way, everyone is watching now) Who's going to tell Jenny? OMG, Eric fessed up to the kissing, but Jenny backs up Asher's so-not-straight story that it didn't happen. Eric professes he's gay, Asher calls him a fag, Eric storms off, and then Blair forwards *all* of Asher's texts, emails and photos to Gossip Girl! Blair is somehow simultaneously smug and noble.

Lily has called Rufus - how did she not know her own son was gay? Rufus says we don't always know the people we're the closest to the best, echoing his contretemps with Jenny. Love is the answer, when you're a parent waiting for your kid to come back to you. The two bond, with romantic overtones.

Update -- Gossip Girl has the proof that Asher was involved in same-sex smooching and that Jenny was lying about giving up her virginity. Blair feels queenly, and seems about to sweep the wannabes away from Asher's party. They offer Jenny one last out -- did J sleep with Dog Walker/Owner boy? Jenny admits exaggerating -- the wannabes can understand dating a gay guy but NOT lying to one's friends. Jenny is branded ""L"" for liar! All fall to Blair now, who says no plans tonight, but perhaps tomorrow? Jenny is saddened.

Lily is waiting up for Eric -- she apologizes for her earlier reaction. Eric plays strong and honest, so she offers to be honest and upfront too. She's scared, she wants the best for her kids, and is worried about him. He says he's better now that he's honest. The two hug.

Blair is at her penthouse savoring her victory (now plastered all over the internet) when in walks..... Jenny! J says she's done with it all. Blair is dubious while Jenny is sincere. Jenny says it's not all worth it, Blair says (with a bit of sympathy) that there's a price to pay, Blair acknowledges that Jenny put up a good fight. The two don't exactly see eye to eye, but understand one another better. Still, why does Blair narrow her eyes like that, as if she's still threatened?

Back to Dan and Serena - does Serena like his new pal Sarah? Um, not so much. Is she jealous, Dan asks. S realizes how much Georgina/Sarah has infiltrated herself into Dan's life. She asks him not to trust this new girl, Dan shows some backbone and angrily asks why -- he's maybe finding the end of his rapidly fraying Serena rope. He sends S off home, but with a caveat to talk... Serena is as usual balky.

S and G get a moment alone - what does G want? She wants things to be like how they were before ""that night"" when everything got all screwed up. Can't they be friends again? Serena is aghast -- um, no! Um, yes, Georgina counters. G can indeed do things -- because she can. She has the power -- over Serena's family, friends, and new boyfriend. Oh, look -- a cab! Get home safe, Serena.

Dan and Rufus are playing Scrabble - Dan's word choices are proving therapeutic (angry, girl, etc etc). Jenny returns in full party outfit, sad. Words aren't spoken at first, then Jenny asks if she can join the game. Rufus says yes. Jenny cries on Rufus' shoulder -- she's sorry about everything.

Meanwhile, Serena shows up at Blair's penthouse on the verge of tears. What's wrong, Serena? What happened? Blair implores S to tell her what's wrong, despite Serena's protests. S can't and says it would make Blair a part of it. Blair says you can tell me anything..... she loves her... what is it?

OMG! SERENA SAYS SHE KILLED SOMEONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1122273/?ref_=ttep_ep17,,"Georgina reveals the true reason that Serena fled Manhattan for boarding school, and Serena quickly falls back into her old habits.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Tony Wharmby'],"['', '', '']",[],"['new york city', 'manhattan new york city', 'upper east side manhattan new york city']",[],"Previously on Gossip Girl: Blah blah Lily, blah blah Rufus, blah blah Vanessa and Nate, blah blah Chuck, blah blah Georgina/Sarah and Dan, blah blah ""that night,"" blah blah Blair... OMG SERENA SAID SHE KILLED SOMEONE!!!!!!

(Deep breath. Relax. Ready? Okay.)

It's the day after the big confession -- Georgina is trying to call Serena, leaving messages in a very I'm-imitating-Glenn-Close-In-An-Oscar-Nominated-80s-Thriller kind of way (but with way better hair). No reply at all, as Phil Collins would say.

In Brooklyn, Rufus is practicing guitar, ready for his Rolling Stone (product placement!) gig about forgotten bands of the 90s. Dan counters with a nasty remark towards the Starbucks demographic, Rufus laughs it off and offers a VH1 joke ready for Dan... who doesn't make one, on account of a sleepless night. Total girl trouble! Dan says Serena isn't telling him the whole truth, Rufus says Dan is way judgemental.... Dan is offended at first but takes the advice.

Still in Brooklyn, Nate is rocking a sweater outfit and tousled hairstyle that says he just rolled out of bed in Manhattan and sauntered his way across the East River to Vanessa, who is Rufus' honorary roadie for the ""big gig"" tonight. A phone call keeps the two from serioius flirting.... uh oh, sounds serious! Nate has to run, he offers explanations and asks what she's doing tonight. Can he meet her at the concert. It's a real date!

Lily is preparing for the wedding, but does she remember she also has a Rolling Stone (placement again?) interview? Dan stops by, but no one's seen Serena. Chuck saunters in wearing a beige-type golf outfit, complete with plaid pants. Has Chuck seen Serena? Nope, and a phone call Chuck receives gives the impression no one knows where S is.

Nate enters a wood-paneled elevator, just as former-friend-turned-enemy Chuck enters. Both are headed to....Blair's penthouse? The maid tells the dynamic duo to wait... Blair's on her way!

Back to creepy Georgina -- leaving the three-thousandth message for Serena. She's got coffee -- such a good ploy! Uh oh - Dan spots ""Sarah"" who plays the OMG-what-a-coincidence card! Sarah is all concerned, offering advice. Just then... Serena calls! But wait - it's some bartender, calling the first name on Serena's speed-dial. Things do not look promising... and Dan looks sad, but plays good guy.

Blair arrives back at her penthouse -- she needs Chuck and Nate's help. Actually, ""we"" need their help. Serena is slumped in the elevator. Chuck and Nate play noble men and drag Serena upstairs, while Blair orders coffee from the maid. Must have been a bad night!

The three try to clean up Serena and wake her up -- keep her talking! Chuck saunters in with hangover food, Nate turns away as Blair undresses S, but good old Chuck leers at the Victoria's Secret underthings revealed. ""Just like old times,"" Chuck says. Serena throws up on cue.

Blair explains the sitch - Serena confessed something totally crazy, B went to find her mom's Valium (a good friend, that B!), but Serena then disappeared and it took B all night to find S. Chuck wants to know the crazy confession, but Blair dodges artfully.

Rufus is unloading for his gig alongside Vanessa -- should dad be worried about Dan? Vanessa says it's all about a friend called ""Sarah."" Just then, a vintage pic of Rufus is unfurled.... Turns out Lily took Rufus' iconic image (so says the Rolling Stone reporter). The reporter unleashes with the questions -- when was Lily involved with Rufus? Why did she give up photography? Before or after she broke Rufus' heart? Just then Dan arrives -- Lily is totally relieved. Who's seen Serena? Maybe ""Charles""? (That would be Chuck) Lily tries to send Mr. Reporter on his way, but he presses on with the how-much-did-you-love-Rufus interrogation. Lily stammers... she wasn't in love with him.... that much! End of interview.

Dan arrives at B's penthouse, where it's Serena Central with Blair, Chuck and Nate. Dan wonders at the unusual convergence. They try (badly) to tell him that Serena's not there, but B offers up a story... Serena does *not* want to see Dan! Brooklyn Boy tries to laugh it off, but he wants to see her -- for super-serious. Just then Serena arrives, pale with hair pulled back in purple velour robe.

""What's happening?"" Dan asks. It's hard to explain. He wants to know her secret. What is the deal? Who are the guys from the bar? She doesn't know -- looks like she really doesn't know. Then he asks if she slept with someone else. He's serious, she sees a reason to push Dan away from the truth and says yes. Dan says he's done. OMG!

As Dan enters the elevator, ""Sarah"" calls all concerned - does Dan want to meet her? She's a real good listener. The answer is... yes.

Lily's back in full-on wedding planner mode. She's had three perfect weddings before and wants this one to be more perfect than perfect! Just then Blair's maid calls with news... Serena is like the ""old days."" Lily should be worried for her daughter. Uh oh! Lily now has to run a very familiar errand.

Lily starts searching Serena's room and finds.... the flash drive with the dreaded video!

Back at Blair's, Serena explains she didn't do anything bad the previous night, and would rather have Dan think she cheated than...know what she really did? Nate is curious! Dan can't know the truth... and even Chuck is getting scared! Blair says she can tell them anything, and a quick recitation of past misdeeds (Chuck and Blair in a limo, Nate and Serena on a bar, Chuck being, after all, Chuck) is offered up. They totally won't judge! Really! They're the non-judging Breakfast Club! What is it, Serena?

""If I tell you, it can never leave this room!"" Cut to commercial, naturally.

Back to the story - remember Georgina? Chuck lost his virginity to her in the sixth grade. Something happened the night of the Shephard wedding -- something S wants to escape, but G is blackmailing her. Turns out that was where Nate and Serena got down and dirty -- skp that part, please, says B. But then, after... Serena left in a rush, flags a cab to Georgina's hotel, where G has a surprise waiting.

Just then, Lily is watching G's video - Georgina and a mystery man are planting a camera for an actual-real Serena van der Woodsen sex tape. Is she down for it, asks Mystery Man? Georgina says S goes down for anything! (Reowr!) Serena arrives but is a total downer about having boinked Nate. Mystery Man wants a party... so break out the favors! OMG, it's cocaine! Serena demurs and goes to hurl; G says S is always frisky after reverse peristalsis (our words, not G's). Lily fast-forwards (whew - thank you! Get to the good stuff!). Mystery Man wants to make out, Serena is not in the mood, but sluggishly acquieses. Soon she's into it... Lily stops the video!

Back at Blair's, B asks S to press on with the story... back to Mystery Man on top of S. Serena tries to put him off with more cocaine. He does some... and then promptly overdoses. S goes to call 911, but Georgina bursts in and stops her. Get the drugs, get his phone, get out of there! Still, Serena calls 911 but G drags her out. G splits but S waits to see the paramedics helping ""Pete"" and gets a full view of the body bag instead. After that, boarding school was a good idea... and B understands why S left. Savvy Nate asks what Georgina wants. And S spills the Georgina/Sarah story. Tell Dan, everyone says! Serena says OMG no! He'll never speak to her again! Truth brings consequences after all, says Gossip Girl.

At the Palace, it's Lily's big rehearsal dinner. Serena and Blair and Chuck arrive -- Lily sweeps her daughter off and grills her like a steak. What about the drugs, and the video she watched? Serena panics, but turns out Lily never got to the drug overdose hijinks. Lily tears up -- what has her daughter become? Ah -- seems like Lily thinks this happened recently! And proffers reformatory school as a cure for it all! Serena is stunned.

In Brooklyn, Sarah and Dan arrive for Rufus' concert with... special guest star Lisa Loeb? Yes, the real singer! Sarah/Georgina is super-nice to dad, and Dan offers the rationale for why Jenny's not in this episode (she's at mom's). Uh oh - a girl in the audience yells out, ""Hey, Georgina!"" G/S ducks and takes Dan over for a drink.

Back at Lily's, Blair confronts icy mom and politely dresses her down, sadness in her eyes. Serena has a secret that is finally catching up with her -- Blair needs Lily's help. Serena needs Lily's help. There's a story Lily doesn't know. Lily goes to find out.

Nate's on his way to Rufus' concert to meet Vanessa -- in the night's most shocking turn, he says he's going to take the subway! Vanessa laughs and says look for Dan, who's there with new girl Sarah. Nate is on point all of a sudden, Vanessa is confused.... Nate tells V that she should SO not trust Sarah, who is really Georgina and he will explain it all when he gets there. Nate then calls Blair -- after ""ews"" are exchanged re Rufus/Vanessa/concert/location-outside-of-Manhattan, Nate gets down to business: Georgina is at the concert. Blair says she'll meet him in 10.

Meanwhile, Lily is off to ""help"" Serena - to juvenile hall, from the sound of it. She kisses Chuck's dad and heads out. Meanwhile redux, Blair tells Chuck she knows where Georgina is. Chuck is totally in to get the evil G. The two are reunited, and it feels somewhat good!

(We failed to mention Blair is again rocking an updated Daisy Buchanan look. We likey!)

Lily and Serena are in a limo -- somehow Lily found out about dead Mystery Man, and tells S to confront his parents. Lily will be right by her side! Whew - no juvie!

Lisa Loeb is hosting the Rufus gig, as Sarah/Georgina runs into Vanessa, who's dubious about her so-called new pal. V is full-on Brooklyn - you got anything to say to me, Georgina? Um, Nate's on his way! G plays dumb, V steps it up and says she has a chance to explain. G walks away. Um, do NOT mess with V, who starts to explain to Dan, but is called away on a Rufus-related errand. Uh oh - what's happening?!?!?

Dan is curious, and serious, and finds Georgina, who's turning on the waterworks.

Lily and Serena emerge from Mystery Man's parents, who apparently have told the two that he was an addict who couldn't stop. Serena still feels guilty, but Lily tells her it's not her fault. Serena is really a good person! Lily's sorry she doubted her. The two hug. And Serena has to do something else -- take her to see Dan!

OMG OMG -- more shocking than Nate promising to take the subway is Lisa Loeb going into a full-on rendition of ""Stay."" Yes, she's wearing the glasses. Meanwhile, Dan is getting G's full story -- there was a mean ex-boyfriend, and G got really scared and left -- is this for real? Ha - it's not! Wow, good cover! G had to change her name to get away from fictional evil boyfriend. Sadly, Dan is buying it all (apparently influenced by the mellow song stylings of Ms. Loeb). G turns on the heat -- she's been falling for him! Oh, she shouldn't have said! Dan wants to talk now -- for him, that's foreplay! G is smug as a bug in a rug. Evil girl - oh, we likey!

Back at the concert, Rufus is rocking out with an acoustic guitar -- is Rufus really singing? It doesn't totally suck! Vanessa finds Nate, who's brought Blair and Chuck to her dismay. Where's Georgina? Apparently she took off, V's not sure where. Nate and Vanessa go off just as Serena arrives - where's Dan? S tells B it's all over now - she can tell Dan everything!

Backstage, Lily is calling her fiance, but hears dreamy Rufus singing. She's drawn to him, fails to make the call... old feelings emerge. Away goes the cell phone. Lily and Rufus make eye contact, and he sings directly to her. She loves it. But then she leaves! What's happening?!?!?!? No, get away, Lisa Loeb - Rufus does not want to do an encore! He confronts Lily outside, she brutally rebuffs him, then they kiss -- and she's the one who leans in! It's the most action we've seen all episode!

Serena's looking desperately for Dan -- who suddenly calls! She's so happy -- but not for long, as it's Georgina calling from Dan's phone. G found out S told their secret. S isn't afraid of her any more but now -- but now G informs her former pal all bets are off! What is G going to do? It's not what she's going to do, it's who she's going to do it with -- just as Dan walks up with coffee for his new friend Georgina. G hangs up. Dan asks how things went with her mom on the phone, while G offers up a lame story and switches their phones back, and then moves in for the kill....er, kiss! G kisses first, Dan assesses the situation... and kisses back!

Quick cut back to Serena, who is clearly worried. Dan and Georgina walk off hand in hand.

Next week: Wedding! Fisticuffs! Come-uppance! Confrontations! Classical music! Season finale!"

Serena is trying to reach Dan - she hasn't slept all night and has officially filled his voice mail. She's coming over now! Taxi is hailed.

Back at the Palace -- yowza, it's the morning after for Lily... and Rufus! He gets a call -- it's about a gig. They both have an OMG moment - Lily suddenly has morning after awareness; he just got a call about a tour for his band! Oh yeah, there's her wedding that day too. Everyone is bathed in orange light as awkwardness and sweet emotion ensues. (Rufus has an amazing bird tattoo - who knew?) Breaking up the stilted intimacy is a call from Bart -- oh yeah, that's Chuck's dad, who Lily is marrying -- who insists they meet up in an hour. Any talking points, Rufus asks pointedly? Lily says she'll think of something.

It's also the morning after for.... Chuck and Blair? Actually, they just fell asleep clothed and everything, and she smacks his arm once they wake up, dispelling all la-la music. Bantering ensues - turns out they'd been plotting about Georgina. (Bonus points for the scarf joke - you have to actually see/hear it to get it) Chuck has to go be best man, Blair literally pushes him out the door, they argue nonstop but the sparks are flying, flying! Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn have nothing to worry about, but it's total Philadelphia Story-style action.

Nate and his dad (remember him?) are jogging around the Central Park reservoir. Nate's mom isn't going to Lily's wedding? Nate is confused, Dad makes excuses, Nate is bummed that mom can't meet Vanessa... something is afoot, we thinks. Too bad Nate is so clueless.... ooh, Nate's dad is making plans for shenanigans!

Serena shows up at Dan's Brooklyn loft - she is so glad to see him! Apologies ensue.... just as Georgina walks out! Smirks/shocks are had all around - it's offically a bizarre love triangle!

Conflict time! G tries to bow out but Serena will have none of it. Dan is being nice guy, Georgina is playing wide-eyed ingenue... and then Serena (finally!) lets loose, calling G a ""psycho bitch"" and accusing her of planning this ALL THE TIME! Dan is flummoxed, and Serena says she'll tell Dan ""everything.""

Flash forward to the end of the story; she wanted to tell him everything! And of course, Dan being Dan is super-nice guy despite the sex-with-Nate/drug-overdose-guy/boarding-school story. Um yeah, Dan, it is a lot to digest! Of course, he wishes she'd told him sooner, but he totally gets it. It's all over, right? S asks. They can fix this? Dan is unsure, Serena totally is in denial mode.... she'll see him at the wedding. He kisses her on the forehead - wow, how ambivalent can you be? But then, Serena says she told her mom this might be ""forever"" and Dan is truly touched... quite the mess, eh?

Dan then calls.... Blair?

Lily meets Bart (Edith Wharton fans take note) at a strange, empty loft that Carrie Bradshaw might have owned had she gotten a big book deal. (Bad cabinets) It's the first building he bought... Lily notes how comforting it is to revisit the first things we loved (remorse note!). But Bart is not young anymore, and he's outgrown owning this building. What should Bart do? Let the building go? Lily says yes. He asks pointedly (watchword of the episode) if she can do the same. We know the answer - yes.

Dan and Blair are in cute cahoots over Georgina, calling her from Blair's penthouse. He spills a story to G's voice mail about a huge fight with Serena, not knowing what to believe, and can she please call him? Blair commends him on his subterfuge, but Dan is uncomfortable with the dangerous liaisons. Right on schedule G calls back! Dan is good at the lying, actually... G falls for it. ""Our spot in the park by the pond?""

""See you there!""

B is impressed - Dan is a born liar! Would he like to spill more details? Er, no!

In the park, Dan and Georgina are faux-bonding. Then Dan calls her on her BS, and G backpedals nicely... Dan is confused since they did, um, you know, do it. G is manipulative while Dan is seriously considering how his relationship with Serena is changed. OMG, where are you, Blair?! Finally, B shows up wearing clashing tablecloths -- she's brought Georgina's parents! And they brought the wrath that hell wrought! Blair closes the deal on G (kudos on the Barcelona lisp in ""Ibiza"") as G's mom descends.... and Blair reveals G will be attending a boot camp for troubled girls! Oh yeah, hadn't Georgina heard? There's only room for one ""crazy bitch"" around here, and Blair holds that title. SNAP!

In Brooklyn, Dan is quizzing Rufus on the new tour (Rufus is still showing off the tattoo) and totally calls him on not coming home last night! And oh yeah, dad, there's a wedding I'm going to -- are you intrigued? Rufus totally is. The wedding is happening? Dan reveals that the reason Lily stayed away from Rufus is because Serena asked her to, for the sake of the Dan-Serena lovey-doveyness. Rufus is a bit speechless.... more than a bit, actually.

(BTW, when did Dan start growing chest hair?)

Meanwhile, Jenny (remember her?) has designed a fab wedding outfit for Vanessa (variations on a theme in orange) that Dan is appreciative of. Platonic smiles all around!

The wedding preparations are in fourth gear - Blair shows up wearing a pink floral shower curtain disguised as a mini-dress (love the headband!). She approaches Chuck, more bantering ensues and B tells Chuck how they buried Georgina. So, save the last dance for him? She grabs his fey bowtie, kicks his shin and tells him Serena is the last thing they had in common, so no dice!

(OMG, they are totally getting it on by end of this episode!)

Nate shows up with his dad, and stares daggers at Chuck. Unpleasantries are exchanged; the make-up artist has given special attention to Nate's cheekbones.

Blair comforts Serena indoors -- what, is it a floral-themed wedding? (Pink for Blair, yellow for Serena) Is Dan coming? Is all forgiven? Serena's working on it. Blair is concerned.

Uh oh, Nate's dad is dealing in some shady business - drugs? Chuck sees it all. Can Chuck's goon keep an eye on Nate's dad?

Lily is preparing in front of the mirror as..... Rufus walks in! Cut to commercial, naturally. (Did you know 90210 is coming back? Totes!)

WHAT is Rufus doing there?! Lily is flustered. Does she want him to leave? Lily is still flustered. He's ready to call off the wedding for her (wow, we got our Philadelphia Story couples mixed up!) but while she's affectionate, it can't happen. It's been 20 years. This is not the moment. She's ready to marry Bart, so there - too many questions! What about Dan and Serena? Rufus is strong, Lily is rambling. Do those 20 years count for anything?

Eric (remember him?) asks where Lily is as violins begin to play. Vanessa steps out of a cab, tugging her orange dress alongside Dan. Yes, Dan has to talk to Serena, who shows up. OMG, he *says* he didn't sleep with Georgina, ""but I may as well have."" What does THAT mean?! Sorry, S, time for a wedding - no answers now!

Lily and Rufus emerge -- and tell each other they love each other! Is the wedding off? Apparently not. He wishes her well and sends her on her merry way, loving yet sad.

Everyone is seated (finally) as Serena makes a surly trip down the aisle, followed by Lily. Bart is impressed, as are the violins. Chuck is supportive. Eric is sad. Gossip Girl intones that Dan and Serena are about to ""F things up"" -- is Serena's mascara going to run?

It's the reception -- Dan and Serena are picking at their food, awkward to the nth degree. Dan needs to talk; Serena needs air. Meanwhile, Chuck's goon reports back on Nate's dad, and Chuck will totally be right back. Time to talk to Nate, since his Dad's leaving for somewhere. Vanessa is concerned. Nate makes excuses, because like his dad is clean now, no drugs! What is Chuck insinuating? Chuck actually makes a full-out confession - he was in love with Blair (!!!!) and now is no time to argue when Nate's dad might be in trouble! Nate glares then storms off to investigate. Vanessa is bereft.

Nate stops his dad's limo -- what is up? Dad says he left a note at home -- saying what, Nate asks. Have you relapsed, dad? No, he wasn't buying drugs -- he's skipping the country to avoid jail time! Dad is totally guilty, so time to go. Nate is disillusioned, especially when he finds out mom is in cahoots on this. It's the best thing for everyone. And then, after a whole season Nate finally grows a pair and punches his dad.

(Nate still has yet to trim his bangs, however.)

Chuck is concerned on the sidelines.

Blair sidles up to Vanessa and tries to make her feel bad. Um, B, do you not know Vanessa will get all Brooklyn on you? Still, B thrusts and parries in with a really good dig on how Nate never got over Serena and oh, she must be familiar with that considering Dan's feelings? V looks ready to whomp on her when Eric shows up to break the tension. Crisis averted!

Nate and Chuck are bonding, apologizing, etc etc etc. Wow, is Chuck really in love with Blair? Looks like. Then Vanessa shows up - Chuck, please go inside! It's a long story, Nate intones. Vanessa, unsurprisingly but sincerely, says she has time.

Dan finally corners Serena -- don't run away! Serena is willing to let the Georgina-Dan hooking-up go, and doesn't want to break up..... but OMG, Dan does! Tears are starting to flow, and while Dan is the most understanding person in the world (his words), this all is just way too much. S reveals her tortured psyche -- lying, etc etc. Where are they now? Back to square one? Too much has happened, Dan says. It's just, ""Have a good summer"" now? ""I guess,"" Dan says.

Wow, it's over. Really, truly, sadly.

Back at the reception, Chuck is proposing a toast. It's eloquent but nice... and then he puts down his speech, and starts speaking his heart (or what Chuck has of one) directly to Blair. She rolls her eyes but is touched. Serena, who's just arrived, is saddened with all the budding love in the room.

Chuck and Blair dance.....more bantering ensues, but in a sweeter tone. ""You don't belong with Nate.... Never have... Never will."" They move in. OMG - who knew the sweetest kiss would be had between Chuck and Blair?!

More awkwardness between Serena and Dan - photos for the wedding album? So they can remember this night forever? Ugh!

And Blair uncovers Chuck's biggest secret... he's a romantic. Take it slow this time? She's all for it.

Wait... Dan doesn't want to stop dancing once the photographer is gone? Total ambiguity!

Yowza - now it's one week later! Rufus is on the road and Jenny calls... and she got an internship at Parsons! With Eleanor Waldorf Designs! (Yeah, that's Blair's mom!)

And now, Blair and Chuck are off to Tuscany -- S is helping her pack for the private plane ride. Blair confides to Chuck's new stepsister -- he brings out the worst in her (cue kinky underwear), she brings out the best in him. Who knew? Serena's ears are bleeding, but she's happy her pal is going off for the summer. Has S talked to Dan? No, and it's for the best -- Serena is totally fine.

Chuck and Nate are doing phone bonding -- they're total BFFs now. While Chuck's off to Italy, will Nate be sweating it out in Brooklyn? Chuck asks what happened with him and Vanessa (who Chuck refers to as ""Punky Brewster"") just as Dan asks V what happened with her and Nate (who he calls ""Man Bangs"" complete with hand gestures over the forehead). Dan barrages Vanessa with questions, but Brooklyn V catches him on his game -- he talks so she won't ask him questions about Serena! Dan is not ready to talk about it; V is glad, he'll be quiet. Ha -- not likely! Vanessa looks at him sweetly -- friends, or more.....?

In Manhattan, Serena runs into Nate, and both are bemused over the Chuck-Blair coupling. Turns out S is off to the Hamptons, she needs a break - they both do. But hey! Does Nate want to reflect with Serena on everything? Mmmmmaybe.....

Blair is at Teterboro waiting for Chuck, and kind of flirts with a Bass Industries (is that right?) intern, while Chuck wants to see his dad before heading off.... Dad is all nice, and proud, while Chuck chafes affectionately. Then Bart gets hardcore, about the fidelity, and lovingness, and other people's feelings, and growing up... Chuck looks panicked! Feelings? Chuck knows not of these feelings! Does Chuck want to come back a new man? Uh oh!

Oh, hello! Lily walks in with ""Amelia,"" a blonde looker who's helping with apartment renovations. Chuck gets another text from B, ""Can't wait to see u!"" Amelia is... hungry. Chuck is intrigued, takes roses meant for Blair, trashes them except for one and approaches Ameila. ""I'm Chuck Bass."" Oh, Chuck! Noooooooo!

Blair is still waiting... Chuck is late. She gets another text. He'll be flying commercial at a later date. Cute intern tells Blair he'll ""flip you for the jump seat."" With a line like that, how can B (or we) refuse? Chuck who? Jump seats for everyone!

What will the summer bring, Gossip Girl wonders. Rufus appears to be writing a song -- for Lily? Jenny is prepping various outfits for her internship. Dan and Vanessa are bonding in Brooklyn, while Serena and Nate are doing the same in Manhattan... just as Blair's helicopter takes off. A scorching summer? Remains to be seen! XOXO, Gossip Girl."

Afterwards, he goes to a fancy restaurant where he tries to dispose his awful-tasting meal. Finally, Bean goes to a Royal greeting and gets into mischief.",[],TV-G,Release date,['John Howard Davies'],"['', '', '']",[],"['peeling a potato', 'saxophonist', 'british', 'credit card', 'department store', 'dinner', 'violinist', 'glasses as a xylophone', 'stuck zipper', 'tuxedo', 'strolling musician', 'steak tartar', 'fish', 'trying out product before purchase', 'escalator', 'toothbrush', 'perfume', 'street musician', 'undressing', 'underwear', 'towel', 'public humiliation', 'falling', 'embarrassment', 'boxer shorts']",[],"Act 1: The Department Store On his way to an Allders department store, Mr. Bean encounters a busker (Dave O'Higgins) playing a tenor saxophone and finds himself unable to give him any change, as he only has a banknote on him. Having an idea, he places a handkerchief on the road nearby and performs a rather silly dance, allowing him to get some change from an elderly woman, which he quickly places in the busker's saxophone case before disappearing through the nearby tunnel. Before long, Bean arrives at the store and takes a moment to admire his new American Express charge card. After having to flee from the perfume department upon feeling overwhelmed by the fragrances, he soon begins searching for items to buy, testing them out first, with some done in unusual fashion - he removes a toothbrush from its packet to see how it feels on his teeth, tries on a towel, finds a good peeler by using it on a fresh potato he brought with him and tests two frying pans for size with a raw fish he had inside his jacket.

When looking for a new telephone, Bean finds the ones on display don't have a dialing tone and so thinks they don't work, and eventually takes one from a receptionist's desk when he finds it works, unaware that it isn't for sale. At the checkout, he sets his card on the counter, only for another customer (Paul McDowell) to mistakenly take it after accidentally covering up his own charge card of the same kind that the cashier (William Vandyck) had returned. Bean, realizing this, pickpockets the man and swaps the cards back (instead of simply speaking with the man about the mix-up) but, while returning the customer's wallet to his back pocket, he manages to get his hand stuck and finds himself being unwittingly pulled all the way into the men's toilets. In the cubicle, Bean finds himself trapped, with the customer not knowing he is there until he helps him to find the toilet roll; though the man initially accepts gratefully, he suddenly realizes that he is not alone in the cubicle and jumps up in fright as Bean smiles nervously at him as he leaves the cubicle.

Act 2: The Restaurant Bean goes to a fancy restaurant to celebrate his birthday. While making his choice and leaving the money for the food on a plate, he writes out a birthday card to himself, feigning surprise upon opening and reading it. When the head waiter (John Junkin) returns, Bean orders what he thinks will be a regular steak, and as he waits for his food, he takes a moment to sample some of the house wine before using the glasses on his table to chime out ""Happy Birthday to Me"". When the waiter (Roger Lloyd-Pack) arrives with his meal, Bean pays him for the meal, making him think he is being given a generous tip. Upon being left to eat his meal, Bean realizes that he ordered a steak tartar, whereupon he becomes disgusted by the meal upon tasting a bit of it and being forced to swallow the first bite so as to avoid upsetting the restaurant staff. Seeking to avoid eating the rest of it, Bean cuts it up and sticks bits of the meal in random places on his table. First, he hides some of it in an ashtray then a tiny flower vase, before hollowing out a portion of the bread roll on his table and using the hollow to hide more of the meal, before sliding some under a small plate, and another portion within the base of a sugar bowl.

Shortly after this, a violinist (Steve McNicholas) walks towards his table and, spotting his card, plays ""Happy Birthday"" for him, before playing another tune, holding on a note until Bean eats another piece of steak. As soon as the violinist turns his back on him, Bean spits it down the man's trousers. Spotting that a woman on a neighboring table is distracted by the tunes of the violin, Bean takes her handbag and puts pieces of the steak into it, but while putting it back, he manages to make the waiter trip up over his outstretched leg. Using this opportunity to cover up his actions, Bean blames him for his meal being spread everywhere he hid it, leading the waiter to apologize for the accident and relocate him to another table. The waiter soon brings over a new meal on the house, which to Bean's horror turns out to be another steak tartar which is slightly larger than the original. He must now finish it, as the waiter, head waiter and violinist are all watching him.

Act 3: The Royal Premiere Later, the cinema where Bean works is preparing to host a royal premiere attended by a member of the royal family (intended to be Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, but simply given as ""The Royal"" in the credits). The staff line up in the foyer, awaiting the arrival of the royal party. Bean arrives a little late but is excited to greet the royal, wondering how to do so and eventually deciding upon a swift bow. As he stands in line between the cinema's manager (Robin Driscoll) and an usherette (Matilda Ziegler), he finds that the men all have pocket handkerchiefs within their smart evening suits. After unsuccessfully attempting to steal the manager's own, Bean uses the white, blank side of a postcard to create a makeshift one. When he notices the manager checking his breath, he soon checks his own and decides to use a breath freshener in his mouth. Bean then becomes concerned that his teeth are not clean and snags a loose thread from the usherette's uniform to floss his teeth, only for the thread to get stuck between them. He eventually yanks it out before briefly turning away to scream in pain.

Content the royal will be impressed with his fresh breath and clean teeth, Bean soon notices his fingernails are not clean and opts to use the fly of his trousers to clean them, finishing up just as the royal arrives. As she begins to greet the staff, Bean realizes he forgot to zip up his flies, panicking when they become stuck and then when he sticks his hand down his trousers to pull them up and leaves his finger stuck out through them in a rather lewd manner. Fortunately, he manages to remove his finger and zip his trousers up in time, but upon greeting the royal with his swift bow, he accidentally headbutts her and knocks her to the ground. As staff and security rush in to help her up, Bean makes a swift run for the exit as the episode ends."

Once inside and changed, he becomes excited upon seeing a couple of children's slides and attempts to use one, only for a lifeguard to spot him and order him off the slides. Bean soon spots the diving boards and decides to try out the highest one. However, he soon becomes frightened when he learns how high up he is, and tries to chicken out, only to find two boys waiting for their turn. Forced to attempt a dive, Bean fails at his initial try and decides to climb off the edge. One of the two impatient boys decides to get him off the diving board by stamping on his hand, causing him to fall into the pool. Upon surfacing, Bean spots that his trunks came off and fails to retrieve them as a little girl in a yellow swimsuit fishes them out with her snorkel and innocently takes them with her without her parents noticing. Left naked, just as the lifeguard orders everyone out, Bean attempts to get back to the changing room, hiding to avoid being spotted by a female lifeguard only to encounter and freak out a group of female swimmers who see his nude body, scream, and run away.

After drying and changing back into his clothes, Bean prepares to leave the car park, only to find he must pay £16 in order to raise the barrier over the exit. Since this is too expensive, he opts to find a way to avoid this and decides to find a way of leaving through the entrance. Bean pushes a rubbish bin into the entrance to trick the ticket machine into issuing a ticket to open the barrier and he drives his Mini out, but just as he moves the bin out of the way to leave, a car drives in and forces him to reverse back into the car park. Tentatively waiting to drive at the barrier over the entrance, Bean suddenly spots the blue Reliant about to enter the car park. As the driver takes a ticket from the machine and opens the barrier, Bean drives his Mini at full speed towards the Reliant, forcing it out of his way and causing it to topple over as he leaves.

Act 2: Lunch in the Park Heading for the park for lunch, Bean greets a man (Angus Deayton) who is also having lunch while sitting on a bench. Spotting him having a sandwich, Bean sets about making his own using ingredients and tools he stuffed into his coat. He cuts two slices of bread from a loaf with scissors, spreads butter on them with his credit card, washes lettuce under a drinking fountain's water before using his sock to dry it, kills two sardines he takes out of a jar and then crushes peppercorns folded into a handkerchief using his shoe. After making his sandwich, Bean notices the man sipping some tea, and prepares to make his own using a hot water bottle for cramps, putting a teabag into it while placing the bottle's stopper in his ear. He then proceeds to suck up milk from a baby bottle and spit it into the water in the hot water bottle, before sloshing it together. As he prepares to have his lunch, he ties his handkerchief around his neck, opting to use it as a napkin, only for the pepper traces on it to cause him to sneeze, making him drop his sandwich onto the ground and spray his tea all over himself, ruining his own lunch. The man, witnessing this, offers Bean the other half of his pre-packed sandwich as replacement, much to Bean's gratitude as the cap pops out of his ear.

Act 3: The Horror Film Driving to meet up with his girlfriend Irma Gobb (Matilda Ziegler) at the cinema, Bean is temporarily stopped at a junction by a set of traffic lights, but upon seeing a cyclist push his bike manually, he opts to do the same with his Mini and push it round to the road he wants to take, before driving off. Arriving at the cinema, Bean prepares to watch a horror film which appears to be titled A Nightmare (the film poster shown is that of A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child, depicting Freddy Krueger, with the camera placed to cut off the last words) with Irma, providing them with popcorn - a large tub for himself along with a hidden drink in his top, and a small tub for Irma, stealing some from her tub but scolding her when she tries to do the same. Before the film begins, Bean teases her by scaring her with silly practical jokes. However, as the film begins, he soon finds himself being scared witless with the various scenes frightening him to the point he tries to avoid watching it, even trying to force Irma to leave with him only to be forced to remain in his seat. Bean then tries to cover his head with his sweater, causing Irma to scream when she thinks his head has been cut off. Finally, Bean manages to find a solution by using some popcorn as earplugs, and using the popcorn tub to cover his eyes from the film. This works, and he manages to avoid the remaining scenes. As everyone begins to leave as the film ends, Irma lets Bean know they are leaving to which he removes the tub and eats the popcorn earplugs, before trying to tease another of the cinema's customers. The episode ends with Bean failing to notice that she put her coat over her like a cape, causing the pair to scream in fright when Bean finds her coat arm empty, ending the episode."

Upon unpacking the television out of the box and setting it up on a stand, he realizes he's looking at the rear of it. Bean plugs it into a socket and wonders why it is not coming on, only to realize he forgot to wire the plug with the TV's power cable. Upon doing so by screwing the cable into the plug, plugging the aerial and turning on the TV, he discovers he gets no reception regardless of where he moves the aerial to. When he puts the aerial on the floor and sits on a chair in a particular spot, the TV suddenly gets reception, but only if the TV is not facing him. He tries bending over to see the screen, but loses reception when he turns his head to face the screen. No matter what he does, he cannot get reception with the screen in his line of sight. Ingeniously, he decides to take off all his clothes and assemble them on the chair to resemble himself. This eventually works when he includes his underwear in the assembly (using the TV's cardboard box to cover himself). Unfortunately, just as Bean sits down to watch the program, the electricity meter runs out and cuts off the power, much to his annoyance.

Act 2: The Thief Later that day, Bean heads out to the local park to try out his new Polaroid camera. Unable to get a clear shot, Bean asks a passerby (Nick Hancock) to take his photo, but the man tricks Bean and makes off with the camera. Upon realizing what happened, Bean seeks the thief out, eventually trapping him in a rubbish bin and stabbing him with a pencil, but the thief gets away just as Bean alerts a passing police officer (Matilda Ziegler) to the incident. At the police station, Bean tries to identify the thief in a police lineup, but asks the police sergeant to make a slight alteration after having difficulty trying to identify the thief by requesting the men in the line-up to have rubbish bins over their heads. Using his pencil, Bean stabs each one until he hears the culprit's scream of pain that he recalls, effectively identifying him to the police.

Act 3: The Shoe While heading through town, Bean feels an itch in his foot. To relieve the itch he removes his shoe and sock and places them on the roof of a parked Mazda 323, only for the car to drive off with them. Bean finds himself forced to hop through town trying to find them, briefly stopping in a shop to find a shoe that matches his own but being unable to buy just one shoe when the salesman (Dursley McLinden) insists he buys a pair. Chasing after the car, Bean eventually manages to jump in front of it, causing his shoe and sock to fall off and into his grasp, and leaving him to thank the driver.

Act 4: The Evening Date Walking through town at night, Bean attempts to comb his hair in a shop window, but has difficulty combing the back of his head. To resolve the problem, he uses an ID photo booth to photograph the back of his head, before heading off to a nightclub called ""Club Phut"" (the word was previously seen as graffiti at the start of ""The Return of Mr. Bean""), meeting up with his girlfriend Irma Gobb (also played by Ziegler). As they head inside, Bean is irritated by the club's flashing neon sign so hits the power box for the sign, causing it to stop flashing and eventually cut out. Inside, the pair enter the stage area where a magic act is being performed by a magician named Eddie Spangle (Alan Shaxon). Trying to attract the attention of a waitress (Julia Howson), Bean inadvertently becomes a volunteer in the magic show. He soon causes mayhem when the magician uses his watch for a magic trick, and messes up some of the magician's magical gimmicks while searching for his watch, much to Irma's embarrassment. Upon retrieving it but seeing his girlfriend gone, Bean heads out and into the club's dance-floor while Spangle angrily searches for him after he ruined his show.

Inside the disco, Bean finds Irma dancing with another man. Jealous, Bean tries to butt in and take back Irma, who ignores him again and simply continues dancing with the other man, eventually leading him to force the man out of the disco. Hoping to get Irma to dance with him, Bean asks the DJ to change the music to something romantic, only to find that the man returned and is embracing Irma. Heartbroken and humiliated, Bean exits the disco but, unwilling to be beaten, he spots the club's power breaker and shuts it off on his way out.

Eventually, Bean gets up 50 minutes later, conducts some light exercise, brings out his clothes and then has difficulty shaving when his electric razor catches his nasal hairs. Upon noticing a reminder that he has a dental appointment, he realizes he is running late and proceeds to grab his clothes, his shoes, his toothbrush and toothpaste and heads for his Mini, coming back suddenly to ensure his cuddly toy, Teddy, is tucked in bed. Rushing for the appointment, Bean proceeds to get dressed while driving, using a brick on the accelerator for some of the journey alongside his feet for the steering before eventually brushing his teeth, using the car's screen-wash to rinse his mouth out before spitting it out, the contents landing on the buttocks of a local builder, who initially mistakes it for bird droppings.

Arriving at the dental surgery of Mr. A. M. Peggit (Richard Wilson) in the nick of time, Bean parks out front, forcing the blue Reliant out of the only parking space. A traffic warden then appears, prepares to ticket the Reliant and makes Bean notice that a part of his pajamas is sticking out of his trousers, forcing him to remove it and toss it in his car window. Once inside the waiting room, he can't find anything good to read other than a Batman comic book in the hands of a young boy (Sam Mead) who refuses to share the book, and tricks the boy's mother (Christine Ellerbeck) into thinking he has wet himself by pouring water from a vase onto his lap in order to get the comic - only to find he has no time to read it as the dentist is now ready to see him. Inside with Mr. Peggit, Bean causes mayhem behind the dentist's back, adjusting the dental chair to unusual positions and messing about with some of the equipment. Eventually, he accidentally injects the dentist's leg with a needle containing a dose of anesthetic, causing him to fall over and then pull down an X-ray blocker, knocking him out. Feeling inconvenienced by this, Bean decides to do what the dentist was planning to do - put a filling into his tooth. Although he manages to do this, he soon finds that the holder containing the dental map of his teeth can flip vertically and horizontally thus leaving him to drill each tooth and put filling on all of them, effectively causing them to be stuck together. Fortunately, Bean gets a fright when Mr. Peggit wakes up and this is enough to free his jaws. Satisfied with his own work, he leaves the dentist to enjoy the rest of the day.

Act 2: The Picnic Following his dental appointment, Bean drives to the public park to have a picnic. The car park is full except for a gap between two cars only just wide enough for his Mini yet with no room to open the door, so he gets out and pushes his car into the gap. However, much to his annoyance, a car next to his car drives off. While passing by a boating lake, he spots a young boy (Hugo Mendez) having difficulty with his remote controlled boat. Offering to help, he opens up the controller and tweaks the circuitry inside, fixing the problem. Unbeknown to both Bean and the boy, the controller also takes control of an elderly man's (Michael Godley) electric wheelchair just behind them, which goes wherever the remote control boat goes. After hogging the controller for some time, Bean hands it back to the boy and leaves just as the now empty wheelchair approaches in behind him, pushing the boy into the lake (off-screen) just as Bean finds a nice spot. He soon begins setting up his picnic which consists of a large blanket, a portable transistor radio, a cake stand, a plate, a bottle of orange juice, a small chair, a book and a nice iced cupcake complete with a cherry on top. Unbeknown to him, a car thief breaks into his Mini and hot-wires it, only to find the steering wheel is missing; Bean had removed it and had it with him in his picnic basket.

As Bean prepares to read his book and eat his cake, a wasp suddenly buzzes around his spot and refuses to leave him alone, irritating him. He soon attempts to deal with it as he goes after his cake, swatting at it, jousting with it, chasing it around and even trying to drown it in his bottle of juice. Bean finally manages to kill it by tricking it into landing on the pages of his book and then quickly closing the book. Satisfied, he soon resumes what he was doing only to find an entire swarm of wasps coming for him, forcing him to abandon his picnic site as the end credits roll. Unable to lose them, Bean tosses his cake into a nearby car unaware that the car thief (Nathan Lewis) is now in it, who soon finds himself being targeted by the wasps. During this, the wheelchair from earlier stops by the car as the episode concludes."

After using a series of keys to retrieve his car's ignition key, he discovers that the battery is flat, so decides to take the bus. Upon reaching the bus stop, the man (Roger Sloman) already waiting there has a heart attack, terrifying Bean. Bean tries to revive him by stomping on him, stuffing pills down his throat, trying mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (with the man's magazine) and using electric shock treatment using jump leads connected to a nearby lamppost. The electric shock treatment initially works, but he forgets to remove the jump leads from his hands when the man offers a handshake, giving the man another electric shock, making him pass out again. An ambulance arrives; while the paramedics treat the man, Bean uses the ambulance battery to jump start his Mini. Bean drives off and leaves the ambulance disabled due to a dead battery, forcing the paramedics to call for a replacement.

Afterwards, Bean heads to a postbox, but on the way he accidentally swallows his postage stamp. He offers to post a letter for a lady (Su Douglas), pretends that he has posted it but hangs on to it until she is gone, so that he can use it for his own letter. He removes the stamp using steam from his car radiator, and sticks it to his own letter using a sweet stuck (since the first episode) to the inside of his pocket. He sticks it to his own letter with a fist (when using just one finger to stick it down does not work). The postman (John Rolfe) arrives to empty the postbox, just as the lady returns to find her letter on the ground. She complains to the postman that there was a stamp on her letter, but now it is gone. Bean hides inside the postbox to avoid getting reprimanded by the postman for the theft of the stamp. He gets locked inside for an unknown amount of time (the original commercial break occurred here), though as the postbox had a ""1"" showing, it was probably all night. He keeps trying to call out for attention, which goes unnoticed, and then he waves his tie out of the hole only to attract a dog who yanks on it, nearly choking him. When he is finally released (by another postman), he loses his car keys down a drain and gets a bus home. He waits at the bus stop with another man. The man gets on the bus but Bean cannot as all the seats are full, forcing Bean to wait for the next one.

Act 2: The Holiday At his bedsit, Bean packs for a holiday but his small briefcase does not have enough space for his clothes, as well as some cans of baked beans. He reduces the size of his belongings (often using scissors) to fit them into the case by cutting a pair of trousers (before realizing he already has a pair of shorts), breaking his toothbrush, pouring some toothpaste down the sink, taking just one sandal and packing a flannel instead of a towel. He does not have the heart to cut up Teddy. After finally managing to fit his things in the small case, he reaches under the bed, only to discover that he has a larger case. However, because his small briefcase is already full, he just puts it into the larger suitcase, along with the one thing he could not pack before, a book.

Bean boards a train and reads the book, sitting across from another man (Stephen Frost) who is also reading. When the man reaches a funny moment in his book, he begins laughing loudly and continuously, distracting Bean. Bean struggles to cover his ears to avoid the laughter, eliciting curious stares when the man looks up. He finds some chewing gum under the carriage seats, pushes it into his ears and thus it works to block out the noise. Finally, the train conductor (Nick Hancock) comes in and asks to check their tickets. Bean is startled by his presence, and accidentally throws his book with the ticket tucked inside out of the train window, and the man bursts out laughing once more.

Eventually, Bean boards an airplane, but he is forced (by the air-hostess (Eryl Maynard)) to look after a sick boy (Hugo Mendez) next to him, who is travelling all by himself. He tries to cheer the boy up by various means, by sticking magazine bits on his face to amuse him, playing with a self-inflating life jacket (it later flies out of Bean's seat) and by blowing air into a paper bag and trying to pop it. Realising the bag has holes in it, he starts searching for another empty bag. While his back is turned, the boy vomits into a sickness bag and offers the bag to Bean, who takes it unaware and pops the bag between his hands. The act ends with the popping noise of the bag and the screen goes black, leaving the outcome ambiguous and ending the episode."

After parking directly at the front of the store, and harassing a man dressed as Santa Claus (C. J. Allen) by plucking on his false beard, Bean proceeds to test two different baubles, going with the one that bounces off the ground instead of the one that smashes to the floor. He then looks to test out some Christmas lights, and managing to get into a storeroom while an employee (Owen Brenman) is busy dealing with a customer, tries it out on a socket being used for the store's exterior lights, plunging the entire exterior of the store into darkness in the process.

As the employee sorts out his purchases, Bean spots the shop's Nativity scene display and performs a creative yet inaccurate story by playing around with it and some nearby toys, first by making some of the figurines shush anything that could wake the baby Jesus, having a shepherd figurine round up some toy sheep, and then having two toy tanks and a toy Dalek battle with a toy Tyrannosaurus Rex, eventually having the little baby Jesus figurine airlifted by an angel attached to a magnet hanging down from a toy helicopter to the bedroom of a doll house alongside his parents' figurines. His fun is soon disrupted by the store manager - introducing a toy policeman into the Nativity scene to halt proceedings - who hands him his purchases and watches as Bean leaves the shop.

Following his fun, Bean heads to a local Christmas market, where he spots another man dressed as Father Christmas. Again he pulls the man's beard, only to find that it is real, prompting Bean to take a quick exit while the man recovers. Later, he meets up with his girlfriend, Irma Gobb (Matilda Ziegler), and is dragged to the shop window of a jeweler's, whereupon she tries to give him the message that she wants a sparkly ring in the display by pointing at it through the glass. Bean nods to her in agreement (albeit expressing disgust when she kisses him on the cheek), and heads into the shop, much to Irma's delight. However, Bean thought Irma wanted the portrait and goes to buy it.

Afterwards, Bean volunteers to help the conductor (John Warner) of a Salvation Army brass band performing ""God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen"" at the market collect money in his bucket; in doing so, he catches a young pickpocket (Lee Barrett) with a wallet in his hand and forces him to surrender all the items he stole, include cash and jewelry and the ring he hid in his mouth. Bringing these to the conductor, who secretly decides to check out what he brought back (implying that he is greedily stealing the goods rather than donating them), Bean finds himself conducting the band, and has some fun with them, before having them conduct the same song with an upbeat, jazzy feel to it, earning a big round of applause from the crowd. With the conductor now back, Bean attempts to buy a Christmas tree from a stand, only to get to the stand just as the last two trees are bought. Frustrated and wanting a tree, he cuts down the market's large tree, attaches it to the roof of his Mini and drives home with it, with everybody at the market (including the band and the conductor) completely oblivious to the theft.

Act 2: Christmas Eve Back at his flat, Bean has set up a piece of his stolen Christmas tree with his new lights and his bauble, before he leans out of his window and pushes the rest of the tree away, letting it crash onto the street below. He then writes a few Christmas cards (all of the same design) and sealing them in envelopes, then stepping outside and posting them to himself. Satisfied with his decoration, Bean searches a cupboard for some Christmas crackers, but is underwhelmed by the lack of a loud pop from one, and so decides to take out the fuses of the other crackers and stuff them all into one to make a ""super cracker"".

Warming up his flat with a fire, Bean hangs up three stockings in his room: one for Teddy, one for himself, and one for a tiny mouse living in a hole. Enjoying a box of chocolates and drinking a glass of sherry, Bean tries to find something good to watch on TV but finds only war and horror films. As he turns his TV off, he hears muffled singing coming from his door, whereupon opening it he finds a small group of young carol singers performing ""Away in a Manger"". Deciding to watch them perform from his seat as if he was watching TV, Bean soon becomes bored and rudely shuts the door on them just as they finish the song before heading for bed.

Act 3: Christmas Day The following morning, Bean wakes up excited that it's Christmas morning, and proceeds to check the stockings - Teddy's contains a tin that holds a pair of drawing pin eyes within; his as a sock that has the other sock of the pair inside; the mouse's contains a piece of cheese, which Bean immediately places onto a mousetrap.

Bean soon gets to work in the kitchen on preparing the large turkey he won at the market, but while stuffing it, his watch comes off and gets lost inside. Unable to find it, Bean sticks his head into the turkey, whereupon he finds himself unable to pull it off just as his girlfriend, Irma arrives. He asks her for some cup of tea if Bean is having one, even though he can't get the turkey off his head. He then gets a saw, but Irma screams in terror. After attempting to cover up his predicament, Irma eventually helps him to remove it, allowing Bean to recover his watch but at the cost of the turkey as it is lost out of the window in the process.

With the turkey gone, Bean and Irma instead eat cranberry sauce sandwiches along with carrot slices for dinner, whereupon Irma refuses to give Bean his present until she gets a Christmas kiss, only for him to distract her and rudely snatch it, ignoring her anger as he finds it to be a model ship. Realizing he is being forgetful, Bean produces Irma with her present, only for her excitement to turn into confusion and disappointment when he reveals that he bought her the portrait in the jeweler's display that was next to the ring, believing it to be what she really wanted. When Irma begins to sob quietly, he reveals that he ""forgot the main bit"", and produces a ring box, which surprises Irma. When she opens the box, however, she discovers that it contains not the ring she wanted, but a screw-in hook for hanging the portrait. A furious Irma storms out of the flat, leaving Bean puzzled and muttering to himself ""What was wrong with it?"" Realizing that she cannot pull his super cracker with him, he decides to do it himself, saying ""Merry Christmas"" to himself crestfallen. As he does so, the act cuts to a view of his window from the street, along with a sudden white flash and a loud banging sound."

Upon parking his Mini at the foot of the entrance stairs, he fights with the bellboy (Matthew Ashforde) over his suitcase, mistaking him for a thief. While Bean is checking in, the bellboy returns and asks Bean to move his car, and Bean hands him the steering wheel with which to go and park the car for him. As Bean checks in, a quiet man (Michael Fenton Stevens) checks in as well and Bean becomes determined to beat the man to his hotel room (room 425), but the man gets to the lift before him. In retaliation, Bean runs up the staircase and stops the lift on every floor. He almost succeeds in entering his room first, but struggles to unlock his door and the man ultimately enters his room before Bean enters his.

Once inside his room, Bean immediately starts investigating, such as flicking the light switch on and off rapidly, standing on his suitcase to see the sea through his window, testing out the telephone, jumping on the bed, and when the bellboy returns and clears his throat to ask for a tip, he gives him a cough sweet instead. Bean finds the remote control for the television and initially mistakes it for a phone, due to his own TV at home having no remote. He tests the remote control's signal range and turns the volume up once he is outside his room until his other neighbor in room 427 comes outside to investigate the noise. Bean hides the remote in his jacket and pretends to tell the guest inside room 426 to be quiet, and goes back inside once the neighbor is gone.

Back in his room, Bean unpacks his suitcase and places Teddy in his makeshift ""bed"" in the drawer, accidentally decapitating him in the process. He personalizes the room by changing the lampshade for his own, placing his own curtains on the window and drilling holes to hang framed pictures on the walls (the noise can be heard throughout the hotel). He then decides to have a bath, but realizes his room does not have a bathroom. Bean then hears running water in room 425, and is annoyed to discover that room has an en suite bathroom whereas his does not. Bean uses a glass to listen through the wall to locate the bathroom, and then once the man in room 425 leaves, he uses his drill to cut a giant hole in the wall for him to gain access to the bathroom.

Once again, the noise is heard throughout the hotel, and the vibration travels all the way to the lobby and restaurant, prompting the manager (Roger Brierley) to investigate where it is coming from. Just as he knocks on the door to Mr. Bean's room, the man from room 425 complains that he left his watch in the bathroom but cannot get the door open. The manager also tries to turn the handle (in vain) and apologizes to the man, suggesting that it may be jammed.

However, it is revealed that Bean has locked the door and is in the bathtub quickly washing himself. He then finishes and hides the hole with his wardrobe and the curtains from the bathroom. The manager then says that he will have someone come and look at the man's bathroom door just as Bean peeks out of his room wearing nothing but a towel to see what all the fuss is about. The manager notices this as Bean heads back into his room and gives him a suspicious look before walking away.

Act 2: The disgusting oysters At lunchtime, Bean again tries to beat his neighbor to the dining room by knocking on his door and then running off, only to find that the lift is out of order. Annoyed, he goes to take the fire exit stairs, but becomes even more annoyed when he gets stuck behind a slow-moving elderly woman with a walking stick. Instead of simply asking the lady to let him pass, he decides to go around to the other staircase, but becomes further annoyed when he somehow ends up stuck behind her again. He then contemplates pushing her, but stops himself when he hears a couple walking past.

Fed up knowing that it is a big staircase and that he could be there for a long time, he takes a risk and climbs onto the opposite side of the banister to finally get past her. But his victory is short-lived when he ends up behind an equally slow-moving elderly man with 2 walking sticks (presumably the lady's husband). Now stuck between the two with insufficient space to repeat the same tactic and still feeling unable to ask for space to pass, Bean is forced to go down slowly.

Once he reaches the restaurant, he takes a plate and cutlery and sees his neighbor and two people ahead of him in the queue. As a result, he cheats his way to the front by knocking the cutlery and napkin from the two people in front of him. Now behind his neighbor, he proceeds to copy what food he is taking from the buffet, but doubling the quantity and even going so far as to fill his entire plate with oysters, and putting back what the man puts back. Bean then steals the table that his neighbor was going to sit at and starts imitating him by drinking water and using a napkin before putting an obscene amount of salt onto his food.

He then gluttonously eats whatever the man is eating at a certain time. When the man starts to eat his oysters, Bean eats all of his without smelling them. However, the man notices an odd smell coming from his own oysters and asks the headwaiter about it; the headwaiter smells them and apologizes by saying that they are off, then goes to collect the platter of oysters from the buffet and is repulsed by the smell. Upon seeing what is happening, Bean becomes scared and sickly that he has just eaten rotten oysters.

Act 3: Locked out of the room nude That night, with much tissue paper and a full chest of medicines beside him, Bean feels sick and ill as a result of eating the bad oysters from earlier, and wakes up from a shocking nightmare involving the neighbor and the restaurant owner laughing demonically at him while oysters are being eaten nastily. He then removes his pajamas and underwear (as he feels hot) and is about to go back to sleep completely nude when music blasts him from next door. Bean looks at the alarm clock and upon realizing that it is 12:05 am, gets up while forgetting that he is nude, knocks angrily at the door and shushes loudly. The music stops and he walks back to his room just as the door closes and locks itself. He reaches for his key, only to remember it is not there, and he is locked outside his room nude. Panicked, humiliated, and knowing he will be arrested for public nudity, Bean hides in a doorway as a couple come past from a night out.

Once they have gone, he manages to escape by covering himself with a fire extinguisher and ""Private"" and ""Exit"" signs while avoiding people. He begins to run down the stairs, only to get stuck behind the elderly lady yet again. So he goes back up and heads for the lift; on the way he comes across another couple making out, so he sneaks past them by crawling under the carpet. He then enters the lift, but the door closes on the string by which he is dragging the ""Exit"" sign along with him. We then see the floor indicator numbers go down and hear a lady screaming in sheer shock. Down in the lobby, Bean peeks out the lift and sneaks out with ""Out of Order"" and ""No Entry"" signs, into his work space. Meanwhile, the manager is talking to Danny La Rue (played by himself), who is performing at the hotel, saying his show was marvelous and that they love him. The performer delightfully goes back in to give them an encore. The clerk then gives Matthew (the porter) the keys to the car and tells him to bring them to Mr. La Rue's car. Meanwhile, Mr. Bean gets the keys to his room from the front, and hides behind a pole as Matthew parks the suitcase and leaves.

The manager gets back behind his counter and almost sees the suitcase moving several times (Bean being in it changing). Matthew then comes back and locks the suitcase, and brings it out to the car, dropping it on the stairs. Just then, Mr. Bean shows up at the counter in a sparkly gown and wig and lipstick, saying ""426 please"", and the manager replies ""Certainly, madam"". Right at that moment, Danny La Rue walks by, noticing his stuff is being worn. He approaches angrily, and says to him ""Here, that's my frock"" and yanks an earring off Bean's ear, causing him to cry out in pain."

He has invited his two best friends Rupert and Hubert over to his flat for a New Year party and is putting the finishing touches on his decorations, which aren't much (a circle of chairs in the living room and a bunch of balloons hanging from the front door). He greets his neighbor who is also throwing a party, and goes back inside to prepare for his guests' arrival. Soon enough, Rupert (Simon Godley) and Hubert (Rupert Vansittart) arrive, and they realize that it's not really the party they were expecting: Bean gives his guests party hats made of newspaper, assigns them designated chairs, and the only form of entertainment is a radio. Bean then goes to the kitchen to prepare refreshments. However, he finds he has almost run out of Twiglets, and so improvises by chopping up a branch outside his kitchen window with a butcher knife and dipping the twigs in Marmite in an attempt to disguise them. He then opens a bottle of Champagne, but discovers that there is only enough to fill half a glass. As Rupert and Hubert wait in the living room, Bean improvises again by using a bottle of vinegar and adding sugar to sweeten it.

As the night goes on, it becomes apparent that Rupert and Hubert are not having a good time. They've uncovered that the ""food"" they've been given isn't genuine (there is a small leaf growing on one of the sticks on Rupert's plate and Hubert is repulsed by the smell of vinegar) and refuse to eat it, despite Bean eating his and pretending to like it. Bean then heads back to the kitchen and takes peanuts from a bird feeder outside and pours them onto a plate. Meanwhile, Rupert and Hubert, fed up with Bean's awful party and now desperate to leave, turn the clock in the living room to just before midnight. When Bean comes back, the clock chimes and Rupert and Hubert say ""Happy New Year!"". Bean is also happy, saying ""Doesn't time fly while you're enjoying yourself?"". They then link hands (almost forgetting Teddy) and sing ""Auld Lang Syne"" to celebrate (although Bean over-excitedly rushes through the song). Rupert and Hubert then feign yawning and claim that they are tired, so Bean puts the doorknob back on his door (for some reason he had taken it off and put it into a fruit bowl; this is a running gag throughout the episode) and bids them goodnight. Right outside the door, Rupert and Hubert come across two women who laugh at their paper hats before heading into the neighbor's flat, where a swinging New Year's party is underway. They then ponder whether to leave or go to the party, ultimately deciding to do it.

Meanwhile, Bean is in bed and puts Teddy next to him before turning off the light and going to sleep. However, he hears the countdown process at the party across from him as well as everyone singing ""Auld Lang Syne"", indicating the real New Year has started. Confused, he turns the light back on and takes a small clock out of his chest of drawers, which indicates that it's just past midnight. He looks at the clock that shows 1:40. He is angered when he finds out that Rupert and Hubert deceived him and attended the larger party next door. Just as Bean switches off the light, a person from the party shouts ""Three cheers for Rupert and Hubert!"". He then goes back to sleep.

Act 2: The Department Store Sale On New Year's Day 1994, Bean drives to the Arding & Hobbs department store in order to take full advantage of the January sales, nearly running over several pedestrians while parking. Dozens of other people have queued overnight to get there first, but Bean manages to jump the queue and annoy everyone in the process by revealing that he created the ""person"" as a dummy, which he placed there the night before in order to cheat his way to the front of the queue. When the doors finally open, Bean excitedly runs in, but not knowing where to go first, he heads downstairs.

Later, Bean has purchased many items, including the armchair that was on display in the window, tins of paint, brushes and mops. After strapping the armchair to the roof, he runs into a problem: because he squeezed everything else inside of his Mini, there is no room left for himself. However, he manages to construct a way of driving the Mini while sitting on the armchair strapped to the roof. He first places a brick attached to a string in front of the front wheel to hold the Mini, and releases the handbrake. He then uses a paint can attached to another string to operate the clutch, further strings for the gear stick and steering wheel, and joins his mop and broom together to form a long rod with which to operate the accelerator and foot-brake. At first, all goes incredibly well, but he ends up on a steep downhill slope after swerving to avoid a roadworks barrier (and behind a parked police car, with the policeman inside eating some sandwiches). He desperately tries to keep the Mini under control as it starts to pick up speed, and things get worse when the head accidentally comes off the broom. Now with no way to stop the Mini, his only braking method is to drive it into a parked lorry delivering mattresses, creating an explosion of pillow feathers.

Act 3: Painting with Fireworks Back at the flat, Bean begins to redecorate with the new items he bought, although it doesn't go as planned. He first realizes that moving the table from in front of the hole in the kitchen wall is impractical, as he can no longer place objects on it through the hole while he is in the kitchen (he drops three glass objects, which smash to the floor). His solution: just move the hole. After getting exact measurements using three pencils (one in his mouth and one in each hand), he uses a reciprocating saw to cut out a section of the wall before moving it into the original hole. However, he neglects to consider what is on the opposite side of the wall, he cuts the two ropes of a picture of teddy bears at a party, and cuts through a picture of kittens, the telephone cable, and the pictures, including the decapitate of Princess Diana and Prince Charles in the process. He also cuts a picture of a body builder, near the groin area. After that he finally got the piece of the wall out and puts it in the hole on the other side.

He then begins to paint the whole living room white, but finds that the bristles on his paintbrush are dried solid. He uses a hammer to attempt to soften them, but when he goes into the living room and dips the brush into the paint, the bristles disappear into the paint, annoying Bean. In a cruel improvisation, he shoves the brush handle into Teddy's rear and uses his head to paint the walls. However, he manages to only get a few lines of paint done before accidentally dripping paint onto things.

Bean then realizes a more efficient way of painting the wall. He carefully covers virtually everything in the living room and kitchen (including each individual grape in his fruit bowl) in newspaper and, when he runs out of newspaper to cover his clock, uses the hat Hubert left behind. Bean then looks through his box of fireworks until he finds a suitable one to explode the can of paint. He places the firework in the paint can and ignites the fuse; however, as he tries to escape, he realizes that there is no doorknob as he has wrapped it up and put it in the fruit bowl. He retrieves it and manages to escape just as the firecrackers are about to explode. Bean quickly runs out and hides behind a corner in the hall. At that moment, a tired and hungover Hubert stumbles out of the neighbor's flat covered in lipstick from the party he and Rupert attended. He is just about to leave, when he realizes that he left his hat in Bean's flat and goes in to retrieve it just as the firecracker explodes.

As Bean returns to his flat, he is puzzled to find his front door wide open and a trail of white footprints leading out to the stairs. He goes inside and is satisfied that his paint bomb worked, as his whole flat is covered with white paint. However, he is shocked to discover a silhouette of Hubert fetching his hat is frozen onto a section of wall as the only unpainted area. The episode ends with Bean looking at the camera with a confused look on his face."

However, the boot handle of his Mini is not in its locked position and as he reverses and moves forward again, a baby's (Elliot Henderson-Boyle) pram gets caught in the handle, and tags along with him to the funfair. Once Bean notices the ""kidnapped"" baby, he initially attempts to leave it in a crowd of chatting mothers with babies, but they are oblivious to both Bean and the baby's presence, and leave the baby behind. Being a responsible citizen, Bean reluctantly goes back for him. Bean, however, sees a policeman outside the amusement park entrance and races to find him, but loses him among a crowd of teenagers wearing fake police helmets from a nearby souvenir shop. Bean eventually realizes that he has no choice but to look after the baby whilst enjoying himself. Bean unchains a Doberman guard dog and uses the chain to tie the baby's pram while taking the baby with him on various rides. First, he goes to the dodgems, but in his hurry to pay the man in charge, he puts the baby's feet on the pedal and has trouble getting back to the dodgem by riding on the back of other dodgems and driving his own while standing up. The man in charge stops the dodgems and confronts Bean, who manages to hide the baby and sneak off.

Act 2: The Kiddie Ride Bean finds a Postman Pat kiddie ride and decides to put the baby inside to cheer him up; however, he then puts nine coins in it so it will play for a long time and keep the baby safe while Bean can go off and have fun on his own. Bean goes on a roller coaster, but quickly gets bored and falls asleep. When the roller coaster ends, the man wakes up Bean by tapping on his shoulder. He then goes to an archery range but accidentally hits the employee (Nick Scott) on the head, before running off. He tries his hand with a coin pusher game in an amusement arcade and tries to cheat by repeatedly hitting the machine after running out of coins. He succeeds in releasing many coins from the machine, but gets his comeuppance when a young boy (Anthony Hamblin) (who he tried to stop from doing so earlier) steals his prize. Meanwhile, a long queue builds up by the kiddie ride. Bean, apparently oblivious to the queue, tries to put more coins in when an angry mother (Lydia Henderson-Boyle) confronts him by complaining to him that they have been waiting for half an hour and makes him take the baby out. Disgruntled, Bean obliges.

Act 3: Changing the Nappy While walking the baby in his pram, Bean suddenly detects a bad smell and, after some pondering over the source of the smell, realizes that the baby needs its nappy changed. Unable to find any fresh nappies in the pram, Bean steals a teddy bear from a little girl (Vanessa Cherié Guarnera) (pretending that he will look after it while she goes on a merry-go-round), cuts the stuffing out and uses it as a makeshift nappy for the baby while leaving the real nappy to be blown about the funfair and ending up on various people's faces and a man's toffee apple. Unfortunately, the baby cries and Bean tries to calm him with his squeaky toy, but the Doberman he set free earlier on follows the noise (comically barking each time Bean squeaks the toy) and gets close to the baby. Though the dog means harm towards neither Bean nor the baby, Bean lures the Doberman into a ticket booth and locks it inside as the man and his daughter can see the dog in the ticket booth. In order to cheer the baby up, Bean cheats in a game of darts by prematurely piercing cards with his darts and throwing them in such a way that it appears he hit a card with all three darts, winning a goldfish. But the plastic bag carrying the fish leaks, and when the water fountain proves to be not working, Bean desperately puts the fish and the remaining water in his mouth in order to keep it alive. He then plays a round of Bingo. The lady sees that Bean was holding his breath and sees that the fish's tail is coming out. Bean quickly puts the fish back in his mouth. He presses the number 69 and wins, but upon shouting ""Bingo!"", he reflexively swallows the water, along with the fish. Fortunately, he manages to spit the goldfish out of his mouth and into a fishbowl with another goldfish; Bean notices this and smiles before leaving.

Act 4: The Reunion Later on, the baby cries again, and this time, nothing Bean does calms him down. Bean buys lots of balloons and ties them to the pram, but, although it succeeds in making the baby stop crying, the balloons carry the pram into the sky while Bean is paying the vendor. In panic after seeing this, Bean steals a bow and arrow from the archery game where he hit the employee, sharpens the tip of the wooden arrow with a pencil sharpener and fires it, popping some balloons and allowing the pram to land right in the same spot Bean accidentally took it from, where the baby's mother is complaining to the police. The mother (Susie McKenna) is reunited with the baby, much to Bean's relief. The mother then sees that the baby's nappy was the teddy bear he stole from the girl from earlier. As he watches the happy reunion, Bean realizes he forgets to return the squeaky toy, but decides to keep it as a reminder of his little friend. Satisfied about returning the baby to his mother, Bean starts to drive home, unaware that the Doberman, having escaped from the ticket booth, has sneaked into the back of his Mini after Bean squeaked the toy. As he drives off, Bean squeaks the toy once more and the dog barks, scaring Bean."

Two Army Cadets then find him pushing his Mini (actually the one moved from the parking space) and help him. While they push the Mini, Bean slowly closes the door and runs behind a wall and makes a humorous sound as if he were inside. He then confuses a troop of Army Cadets, while the commander has gone into an office, by coughing, which causes them to respond by stomping once simultaneously, and then giving military-like commands (The commands of the drill instructor were nothing more than grunts really) which cause them to respond by standing in unusual ceremonial stances and heads inside the school while the angry commander (Al Ashton) scolds his troop of Army Cadets upon his return.

Bean then gets in another man's way while looking at various things on the wall, messes up a philatelist's (John Barrard) stamp collection and frightens a calligrapher (John Clegg), causing him to make a mistake. Later, he sees a woman using a Van de Graaff generator to make her hair stand on end, and then tries it himself but finds it doesn't work on him. However, it leaves his body electrostatically charged, such that when he then picks up a leaflet to read it, it remains stuck to him. After multiple failed attempts to get rid of the leaflet, he hands it to a woman (Harriet Eastcott), but the static electricity causes her skirt to rise up to cover her head and reveal her legs and white granny knickers. Bean promptly leaves while other people try to pull down her skirt.

Act 2: Laboratory Trouble and the Art Class In the chemistry lab, Bean experiments with several chemicals and makes a creative but very unstable chemical reaction, forcing Bean to escape from the laboratory as a young boy (Sam Driscoll) enters and inspects the experiment. As Bean walks out of the laboratory, a violent explosion erupts, with blue smoke emerging from beneath the door.

In a still-life art class, Bean is first made to draw a bowl of fruit. A moment later, the bowl of fruit is replaced with a nude model (Cindy Milo); he does not notice this immediately, but then suddenly realizes he has drawn the woman's breasts and not a piece of fruit; like he initially thought he was doing. Bean is so appalled at realizing what he was drawing was a naked woman, he is reluctant to draw any further despite the French art teacher's (Suzanne Bertish) attempts to persuade him.

While the teacher is tending to somebody else, Bean goes over to the potter's wheel and makes some clay pots; when he is doing it, the boy from the chemistry lab, now covered in blue chemical powder, and his teacher (Lucy Fleming) arrive inside the room to seek the person responsible for causing the explosion. Failing to find him, and having just noticed the nude model, they rush out of the classroom. After Bean finishes making clay pots, he puts them on the model's breasts, allowing him to draw her without embarrassment. The teacher confronts Bean for drawing the wrong object again, suddenly realizing that the grimaced woman's chest is covered in a clay bra. After that, Bean finishes his work and walks proudly out of the class, while the teacher looks at Bean's work and turns out to be impressed with it.

Act 3: The Judo Class and the Toilet At a judo class, a frightened Bean is reluctant to allow himself to be thrown, but ultimately manages to confuse his teacher (David Schneider) by running behind him during the bowing process, push him over from behind, and roll him up in a mat. After the class, when Bean has just changed back into his regular clothes, he finds that he has swapped trousers with someone else and goes on a long search for his own. In the men's toilets, he spots them, cleverly seeing his name on the label while the man is sitting on the toilet. Bean distracts the man, frantically grabs him by the legs and tries to grab his trousers. While this is happening, the drill commander enters the toilet and Bean fools him by cleaning the man's shoes and the commander immediately leaves the toilet. Bean continues and finally retrieves his trousers, as well as the man's underwear, which he throws back to the man-though his underpants end up falling into the toilet.

Act 4: The Unexpected Disaster Just as Bean exits the school, there is an announcement over the PA system stating that there will be a demonstration shortly (the man giving the announcement is voiced by Rowan Atkinson). Bean walks over to where he parked his Mini at the beginning of the day, but soon realizes it is no longer where he parked it. After looking, he sees his Mini in the middle of the car park, with a lot of people watching it from behind. Not bothered by this, Bean makes a beeline for his Mini, but on the way, he is distracted by a woman's cake stall set up nearby. He walks over to the stall and buys a delicious cupcake, unaware that a giant Chieftain tank has just appeared in the car park and that the crushing sound he hears is his Mini being crushed. After the tank leaves, Bean turns around, does a double take, drops his cupcake on the road and slowly walks over to his Mini with a sad look on his face. As the ending credits roll, Bean examines the destroyed Mini and finds that the padlock he uses to lock his Mini was left intact and unharmed. Seemingly satisfied with this, he pulls the lock off and happily leaves as the episode ends."

Firstly, he realizes that the cost of washing has increased from £2 to £3, so he curses and has to take out another pound coin from a specially designed envelope in his trousers. A black belt thug (Grant Masters) arrives and rudely pushes Bean away into the next front-load washing machine. Bean then proceeds to put his laundry, which consists of some shirts, an inflatable toy, a lampshade, Teddy, a welcome mat, two oversized fuzzy dice and a few pairs of underpants (each labeled with a different day of the week), into the washing machine.

Bean then realizes he only placed five pairs of underwear in the machine. Bean assumes that the missing underwear is Wednesday's, then shortly after, he realizes that the current day is Wednesday, assuming that he's currently wearing the missing pair. He then stands behind a partition to change out of the Wednesday underwear to wash them, accidentally getting his trousers mixed up with a lady's (Jacqueline Defferary) skirt. As Bean, now wearing a skirt, walks past the man, this motivates the thug into taunting him. Bean then notices a pair of underwear on the floor, Sunday, realizing that the missing underwear was Sunday's, not Wednesday's. He first tries to open the washing machine to retrieve the Wednesday underwear, but the machine has already been turned on, so he simply tries to put them on but the bully interferes by stepping on them for his own amusement.

Finally having had enough of being bullied by the thug, Bean decides to get revenge by replacing the man's softener with a cup of black coffee from the vending machine. This works, as the man does not realize that he is pouring the coffee into the machine instead of his detergent. However, when the thug gets suspicious after sniffing the cup, Bean appears to drink the softener to make it look as if he is drinking coffee. Later, the thug blames the launderette's manager as his martial arts gear comes out of the machine, all severely stained from the coffee. After retrieving his mutated washing (including a shrunken Teddy) from the clothes dryer, Bean attempts to retrieve his trousers from the lady's washing by climbing into a dryer to find them just as the lady returns. Not noticing Bean is inside, the lady closes the door and turns the machine on, resulting in Bean spinning inside the dryer along with the clothes.

Act 2: The Game of Golf Following the launderette, Bean heads to a golf course to play a game of mini golf. He scores a hole-in-one on the first hole, but on the second hole, he hits the ball onto the open grass. The owner (David Battley) orders him to play properly by using the club to get the ball back to the course and not with his hands. After accidentally hitting the ball outside the golf course, Bean goes on a very elaborate journey as the ball ends up on a bus, inside a lady's shopping bag (she is later seen explaining the scene to a police officer), on a boy's ice cream cone, up the exhaust pipe of a Proton Saga (causing the engine to explode), down a drain, into a litter bin, into a rubbish collection vehicle and finally onto the village green.

When Bean attempts to hitchhike back to the golf course, the first car that drives in is the blue Reliant, which Bean ignores although the unseen driver opens the door for him. When another car pulls up, Bean cuts out the patch of turf the golf ball landed on with the golf club in order to allow him to return to the course without physically touching the ball. As the sun sets and the ending credits, Bean makes it back to the course just as it is closing for the day and finally rolls the ball into the hole, before leaving with a final score of 3,427 strokes."

Inside, Bean gets impatient while waiting in the queue and cheats his way to the front by rudely throwing a little girl's doll and then starting a fight between two men ahead of him in the queue. After Bean pulls his numbered ticket from the dispenser, he races towards the last remaining chair in the waiting room, sitting down just in time to prevent a frail old man from sitting there. He sits next to a seriously-injured female patient (with head wrapped in bandages, and an arm and a leg in plaster), and taunts her by stretching his neck, waving his hands, and crossing his legs. Bean sees his ticket numbered 76 as the digital counter shows 23. Just as Bean checks the time on his watch, he inadvertently reveals his hand stuck in his teapot, prompting the woman at the reception desk (Elizabeth Bennett) and the patient sitting next to him to laugh at him.

Annoyed with how long he is forced to wait, Bean then swaps his ticket for a lower numbered ticket, showing 52, from the severely-injured patient, and sneakily turns the digital counter upside down so that 25 will look like 52. However, the patient thwarts Bean by grabbing on the handle of the teapot on his hand, and the digital counter is returned to its normal position after patients complain of their tickets being ignored. Some time later, Bean falls asleep in waiting and, as the digital counter reaches the real 52, wakes up and loses his ticket (back to the patient who originally had it). As a result, Bean has to get another ticket and he, once again, starts a fight between the same two men from earlier to get immediately to the reception desk. Bean gets angry and frustrated when he takes a higher number ticket and he throws it in the bin, but his other hand becomes stuck as he tries to push down the ticket into the bin to show his frustration. Unable to recover it, he uses his mouth to take out another ticket from the dispenser, and Bean walks to his seat with his hand still stuck in the bin.

Act 2: The Queen's Guard Following the hospital, Bean visits Windsor Castle where he takes a few photographs, including one of the inside of a dustbin and another of a nude statue after covering the private part with a plastic wrapper from the bin. He then pries the Gnomon off a sundial to place his Polaroid camera on the stand, in order to get a photo of himself with a Queen's Guard (Rupert Vansittart). He dresses the guard up with flowers and other things, trims his mustache (into a toothbrush style, similar to that of Adolf Hitler and Charlie Chaplin) and hangs Teddy off his bayonet. While Bean is doing this, the guard attempts to remain motionless (which proves difficult as especially when Bean starts to dangerously clean the trigger of his rifle). Just as Bean has wound the self-timer on his camera, the charge is called and the guard marches away along with Teddy just before the camera snaps the photo. Off screen, Bean groans in anger and frustration from this.

Act 3: Sleeping Trouble Later that night, Bean gets ready for bed (after using his new electric toothbrush to clean his teeth and ears, reading an Asterix comic with Teddy and then putting Teddy to sleep and finally shooting out the incandescent light bulb with a pistol) but has trouble falling asleep. He scares away noisy cats outside the window by disguising himself as a dog and barking, then tries sleeping in different positions (along with sleeping with his face on pillow until he can't breathe), then watches a chess game on TV. As he nearly falls asleep, he becomes startled when the television channel cuts to a Bodyform advertisement via a star swipe featuring loud rock music. Finally, he takes out a picture of a flock of sheep and begins counting them, first with his finger and then, after losing count a few times, with the assistance of a calculator. When he sees the number of sheep (albeit inaccurate) on the calculator display, he instantly falls asleep. After the closing credits, he rolls out of bed and falls onto the floor, ending the episode."

After he chooses what hair style he wants by pointing to a calendar of Prince Charles, Derrick attempts to make the first snip, but is unable to do so as Bean keeps tilting his head forward to read a magazine. The office phone then rings, and Derrick reluctantly goes to answer it. All alone, Bean entertains himself by pretending to give someone a haircut until two customers come in and assume Bean is the hairdresser. The first customer is Jamie (Jamie Yeates), a young boy whose mother (Susie McKenna) leaves him in Bean's care as she runs to retrieve her purse she left at the shop. Bean places a bowl over Jamie's head and cuts his messy shoulder length mullet and fringe into a neater bowl hairstyle. He then accidentally shaves off a small piece of Jamie's hair while trying to use a hair clipper, and ends up shaving a bald stripe down the middle of his head to even it out. Although it looks ridiculous, Jamie is nonetheless satisfied with his new hairstyle.

After Jamie's mother returns and pays Bean for the haircut (which she cannot see as Bean has covered Jamie's hair with a hat), he returns to his seat just as Derrick returns from the phone, only for it to ring again; Bean then resumes being the substitute hairdresser, and his next customer being a man with a ponytail (Colin Wells) which took virtually two and a half years to grow. While trimming the ponytail, Bean becomes distracted by the magazine the man is reading and accidentally detaches the ponytail. After finishing, Bean uses a portrait of a different pony-tailed man over a mirror to deceive him and the man pays Bean and leaves, unaware that his real ponytail has gone.

Bean's final customer is Roger (Frederick Treves), a man who is supposedly a regular at Derrick's. After taking off his glasses, Roger mistakes Bean for Derrick due to his poor eyesight and asks for his usual haircut. Bean then proceeds to use the hair clipper but, despite being as careful as he can, he accidentally shaves off Roger's toupee, causing it to get stuck in the clipper. He remedies it by applying mousse on Roger's bald spot and using bits of hair from the floor to create a new ""toupee"". Derrick finally returns from his phone call just as Roger pays him and leaves, and Derrick's initial confusion intensifies when Jamie's mother and the man who had the ponytail storm in and demand to know where his supposed assistant (who is nobody other than Bean himself) is as they hate the terrible haircuts he gave (even though Jamie insists he likes his haircut while his mother does not).

Bean sneaks out by disguising his face with the Prince Charles calendar in order to avoid being recognized. Roger then storms in and mistakenly greets Bean as Prince Charles himself thanks to his poor eyesight, before going over to and berating Derrick for his haircut. Bean then finally sneaks out of the door and makes a run for it.

Act 2: The Fete and the Pet Show Following his haircut, Bean heads to a fete where firstly, he is unable to find somewhere to park his Mini, so he instead parks in one of the sheep pens after sounding the horn in order to get the sheep out of the way. Upon going inside the fete tents, he cheats at the indoor games, such as nudging a young boy playing a wire loop game, causing him to lose the game. He then plays the game himself, but after failing on the first attempt, he unplugs it and wins; the owner only realizes it has been unplugged after giving Bean his prize. Afterwards, Bean plays a game called ""Hit the Headmaster"", where he must throw wet sponges at the ""headmaster"" (George Webb) in which gets a bit carried away by throwing random objects, such as canned peas and cereal boxes, at the ""headmaster"". He almost throws a chair, but a nearby teacher stops him.

Later, Bean participates at a pet show by entering Teddy into the competition. In the competition, Bean cheats his way through everything using Teddy despite winning easily due to the other kids' dogs not being trained well, much to the annoyance of the contest organizers. At the end of the show, two kids are awarded a ribbon each while Bean is awarded a huge bone by one of the contest organizers. However, Bean does not want it, so he instead takes a jar of honey to his satisfaction. Following this, he throws the bone back into the tent, inadvertently creating chaos off-screen involving the children and their dogs, who are presumably fighting for the bone. As the chaos ensues, Bean promptly exits the tent with Teddy.

Act 3: The Railway Station Following the pet show, Bean gets off a train at London St Pancras railway station. Unfortunately, he has lost his ticket on the way, so he decides to sneak past a security guard (Robin Driscoll). After several failed attempts, he hides inside a mail bag and crawls towards the gate. When the guard leaves once the clock bell rings, Bean climbs onto the gate, but two station workers turn the gate around to which Bean crawls off the gate (while celebrating that he has made it through) and ends up falling onto the railway tracks. Two station workers appear and put the mailbag (with Bean still inside) on board a train carrying cargo and mail that is destined for Moscow. As the end credits roll, we see short clips of a ship sailing through a rough sea (most likely carrying the mail and cargo from the train earlier), and then of a French steam train and of marching Russian soldiers in Moscow's Red Square (indicating that Bean indeed ended up in Russia)."

He had some light exercises and prepared himself for the day, when he noticed his reminder. Bean panics, grabs his toothbrush, and his clothes and rushes to his car.

The young man (Peter Gordeno) takes pictures of the craft and the three are ambushed by orange-suited aliens. The young woman cornered and the man is shot. Still in 1970, a USAF Colonel (Ed Bishop) lands at a small airfield and is met by government Rolls Royce and motorcycle outriders. The Air Force officers brief a minister but while en route are attacked by a low flying UFO. The Rolls crashes, destroying the evidence, but the colonel is thrown clear.

The time is now 1980. The young man is Captain of the Sky-Diver and pilot of Sky-1, a submarine launched fighter aircraft, a team of astronauts, male and female, man a lunar base, an ever-vigilant Space Intruder Detection satellite monitors space, and Colonel Straker is now a movie producer, and secretly in overall command of SHADO from a complex built beneath his studios.

It looks like the aliens cannot reproduce themselves, so they have found out a way of becoming immortals in practice by means of constant organ transplants. The water in which they encapsulate their heads allows them to breath in an alien atmosphere (the Earth's) and gives them a bluish skintone. The aliens have been kidnapping humans for some time, in order to extract the organs which will they will use later on on themselves to remain alive.

One alien has survived a crash. Nina Barry (Dolores Mantez) has found out a way to track the UFO's even though when they travel faster than speed of light. The SHADO has succeeded in destroying some UFOs, and they have even trapped an alien alive. Somehow, that alien understands the humans, but absolutely refuses to talk or communicate in any way. When the alien dies, he is analysed, and his heart is found to have belonged to the sister of one of the SHADO soldiers.

During an alien attack, Edward Straker (Ed Bishop) and Paul Foster (Michael Billington) watch one of their crewman on the dome. Jim Lewis (Paul Maxwell) denies any knowledge about that, because he was supposed to be somewhere else. Dr Doug, Straker and Foster interrogate him.

Straker and Foster go down to the dome to see what it is for themselves. The green structure kind of swallows them up. Inside, they watch the officer they had just left at SHADO headquarters walking like a robot.

He also has a gardener; an Indian Guru Umesh Varma he met in India when he fled from his wife for three months after the birth of their baby Olivia.

Now a renowned poet Quinton invites Father Brown to this strange household. Lady Felicia and Mrs McCarthy also accompany him. Also at the house is Harris, an admirer of the trouble Martha. Quinton asks Father Brown to look after his wife, a lapsed catholic, because Umesh has predicted his death from the sign of a mysterious poisonous plant growing in the garden.

While touring the garden Harris, Father Brown, Mrs McCarthy, and Lady Felicia who trips over the dead body of a poisoned cat owned by the Quinton's. Nearby Father Brown discovers a small unmarked grave.

A scream from Violet leads them to the conservatory to find the hanging body of Leonard Quinton having, from a note he left, committed suicide.

Inspector Valentine initially arrests Umesh but he is alibied by Lady Felicia. Harris confesses to the murder by strangulation because he wished to protect Martha he feared would herself murder her husband.

Father Brown realising Quinton had poisoned himself, testing the poison on the cat, and was already dead before Harris strangled and strung him up. The first suicide note had been faked by Harris and Brown discovers the real note expressing his remorse and love of Martha.

Martha realising her husband still loved her is prevented from killing herself by Father Brown and a sad confession reveals the she and her husband had difficulty in conceiving and when pregnant suffered from terrible morning sickness. Leonard treated her morning sickness with a new German wonder drug, Thalidomide? This resulted in the birth of a severely deformed baby, limbless and the wrong shape. Her husband fled to India while she sold up in London and moved to the present house in the Cotswold. Three months later he returned with Umesh just as the baby died and they buried the baby in an unmarked grave in the garden and hardly spoke to each other again.

Father Brown conducted a private burial service in the garden for the baby, with a named headstone for Olivia, on which Martha scattered the ashes of her dead husband on the grave.

She's 28 years old, speaks six languages, her last serious relationship ended two years ago. (Flash back to them frolicking in the surf in Sri Lanka and buying matching bracelets from a local boy.) The examiner asks if it ended badly. Flash back to her waking up to a note saying ""The truth is complicated, forgive me.""

He asks if she joins the CIA, will she be able to separate her work from her personal life. The machine goes nuts as she says ""absolutely.""

Jump to Camp Peary, the CIA ""Farm."" In a plane, 2,000 feet off the ground, she volunteers to jump first. She soars through the air and floats down to the target area. Perfect landing. Two serious men meet her on the ground, with orders to bring her with them.

Orders from Langley, her language skills are needed on a case.

CIA HQ, Langley A dude named Conrad welcomes her and escorts her in. She fills out a bunch of forms and gets her credentials.

In the office of the Director of Clandestine Services The director Arthur (Peter Gallagher) is peeved because someone leaked info to a reporter. Annie takes her oath as Conrad listens to Arthur promise to find the leak.

A tech guy named Augie Anderson (Christopher Gorham) greets her. He's blind and uses a high tech electronic device instead of a cane. He leads her on a tour - including Starbucks - and lays out some of the rules, including that they can't date foreigners. Dating within the agency is encouraged, to further the ""circle of trust.""

Augie takes her to the Domestic Protection Division Center where Joan greets her and tells her how she'll be outnumbered there by men four to one. She learns about Stanislav ""Stas"" Orlovski, a top Russian operative who just turned to the CIA. She's been assignment as his handler. Joan tells her she has to go in with a two way device, swap bank codes for secrets and pass for a call girl. There was someone else who could do that, but she's gone.

Augie offers up that he was blinded in in Iraq. They bond over Mingus.

At the Capitol Grand Hotel, Annie unbuttons her top button and goes in to the lobby to wait for her page. A slick Spaniard chats her up, but she turns him down. She gets her page and goes up to the room.

She lets herself in and looks around. She finds Stas passed out on the couch in his bathrobe. She asks if he has his PDA and they sync. Then he's shot through the window right through the head. Annie ducks for cover as bullets from a sniper rifle across the street destroy the room. Listening in, Augie calls for back up.

Annie makes it to the door as the room is slowly shredded. Her handler takes her to the waiting van and they drive off.

Joan and Arthur sit through a tense negotiation that turns out to be marriage counseling. Joan is called away. She's not upset to hear Stas is dead, since he's one less assassin they have to keep tabs on. But she's not thrilled Annie left the PDA there for it to get taken into evidence by DC police. Annie volunteers to go back.

She preps, this time looking the high priced hooker part. Augie gives her a PDA to sync with the others that'll get their info and replace it with harmless numbers.

She strolls up to the crime scene and her giggliest voice tells the FBI guys she was there when it happened. She gets into the scene and tells the FBI guy the john was Boris. She tries to show him where she was standing when it happened and moves a scene tech out of the way to get near the PDAs. She syncs her device from in her purse.

The FBI guy says she can go, but he asks why she really came. She collects the shoes she kicked off before. Christian Laboutins don't come cheap.

When she leaves, the FBI guy calls the escort service number Annie gave him and Augie answers.

Annie returns to Langley. They check out the info. It's useless. That's the end of that. Annie's incredulous. She saw a man get killed, lied to a federal agent, got shot at. Big first day.

Augie gives her a pep talk and invites her to happy hour. He knows every chick there. Conrad's there. Annie wonders why Stas sold them bad intel. He asks why she joined the CIA. She talks about traveling and the guy she met in Sri Lanka and the fact she let her guard down. She liked that in the CIA, she wouldn't get burnt again.

A sultry looking Joan walks into a bar and finds Arthur with a woman, who he says is legal counsel for somebody. She says it's innocent but Joan wants to talk to him. She presents him with phone records and reservations which she says prove the affair. He asks her to trust him, but she's an agent, she can't.

Back at the bar, they take turns observing a woman and making up her background and life story. Annie realizes she's late for her sister's.

Annie drives off, but is followed - aggressively. She notices. She slams on her brakes and the BMW blows by. She plays catch up. The car doesn't have any plates. It stops in front of her and does a 180. She follows. They both drive against traffic. She follows through city streets and pedestrians and jumps on the sidewalk in her red VW. Her car finally dies.

Later, she arrives at her sisters to find a dinner party in full swing. Her nieces greet her. Her blind date is waiting. He has mustache. She thinks Annie works at the Smithsonian. He rambles about traffic, chugs his wine, babbles about racketball and oyster shucking.

The next morning, her sister apologizes for trying to set her up and says she can't believe he tried to ""kiss you."" Something about the words sounds like something that rings a bell for Annie.

At the CIA, Arthur meets with the reporter, Liza Hearn, who talked to the leak. He offers to be her source instead. Liza calls it a ""shameless sitdown"" and says she can lighten up with her stories a little of he lays off her sources.

Annie visits her old Russian professor (Clarke Peters) at Georgetown. She tells him she's dating a guy from Moscow and he calls her ""Kitsu."" She asks what it means and he responds by asking her not to work for the CIA. He doesn't believe her when she says she's not. Kitsu means ""kitten"" in Estonia, but it's not the most common way to say it.

Someone from Moscow wouldn't use it.

Back at Langley, Annie flashes her badge and is immediately surrounded by cars with sirens. Inside, Joan chews out Annie for involving her professor in CIA business. They're following everyone after the leak.

She tells Joan the real Stas is still out there. The fake guy used the wrong word, hit on her too much and stood by a window plus she was followed last night. She tells Joan about the kitsu thing and Joan sends her away, telling her she might be washed out of the whole program.

She runs into the bathroom, pissed. Augie finds her and tells her how freaked out he was when he joined. He tells her if Joan was going to fire her, she would have done it. The agency likes people who take initiative. She asks Augie for help.

At the Medical Examiners office, she asks an orderly to take a picture of her with Augie. She uses a Listerine breath strip to lift his print and get in the building.

They find dead Pseudo Stas, who doesn't have the prison camp tattoos the real guy should have. Annie's proud of herself for proving it, but suddenly FBI guys bust in, including the same guy from before, Agent Vincent Rossabi.

She sticks with the call girl story and says Augie was her John and wanted to see the dead body. Augie tells the same story.

The FBI guy steps out and takes a call from his boss's boss's, who tells him to let her go. He thinks she's CIA.

Joan gets an NSA report. Wire taps on her husband show he was telling the truth.

Conrad brings Arthur the next day's story, well-sourced.

Joan tells Annie she was right, they checked DNA. They think Stas did the shooting, because if people think he's dead no one will look for him. So he's there to kill someone. They check the threat matrix. An outspoken Russian journalist named Petrov is speaking at the Smithsonian that night.

At the museum, a man dressed as a waiter hides a gun on his cart and approaches Petrov. Outside, Joan, Annie and a team pull up outside. Stas is carrying his gun under a napkin and near Petrov when he sees them and pulls away.

Joan hustles Petrov out of there as Annie makes her way through the crowd. She's stopped by Ethan, the blind date from hell. In the distance she sees the ""Spaniard"" who chatted her up in the hotel lobby. He runs. She chases.

He leads her through the kitchen, knocking over people and carts as he runs. He throws a liquor bottle on the gas stove and sets off the fire alarm. He races down the stairs and outside to an alley with Annie still on his heels. He runs for the Metro.

Annie reaches the platform in time to see a train pull away. She's looking around for him when suddenly there's a hand on her throat. It's Stas. He marches her down the platform with a gun to her head. He tells her to kneel.

Instead she whirls around and pushes his hand aside. She kicks him, jumps on him, punches him, kicks him, gets choked by him, gets up, keeps fighting but eventually he gets the better of her.

He's choking her against the wall when a train starts to pull up and through her fuzzy vision she sees her long lost beach love, dressed in black, walk up, pull out a gun, and fire twice into Stas. Then he boards the train and is gone. She sees him ride away.

Back at Langley, Arthur gives her the Intelligence Commendation Award, for neutralizing an enemy spy. He tells her she's staying at the DPD.

Annie talks to Joan and tells her she thought the man who killed Stas was someone she knew from traveling. Joan says it was Agent Baldwin, a similar looking guy. She takes Annie's award back - they stay there in the vault.

Joan meets Arthur in the hall. ""He"" is back. He surfaced as soon as they brought Annie in. Ben Mercer. ""They must have had a hell of a time in Sri Lanka,"" Arthur says. He wants her to keep Annie working to try to draw Ben in.

Back at her sister's house, Annie goes for the ice cream. Her sister comes to say good night. She can tell something's wrong and says Annie's a terrible liar.

In her place in her sister's guest house, Annie takes out her scrap book from Sri Lanka. She remembers her romantic nights on the beach there and still has the bracelet.

In a car outside Annie's house, Ben holds onto his bracelet. He drives off."

In the morning, her sister Danielle nonchalantly asks Annie to sign her will agreeing to be the kids' guardian if anything happens to her. Annie wants to think about it.

At work, Auggie tells Annie they're moving into a state of the art facility. Joan greets her with an assignment. She has to debrief the ""walk-ins,"" people who come in with tips. Nutjob duty.

Annie goes to a trailer, gets her mace and listens to wackos' conspiracy theories. She hears a a bunch then a woman says her college student son Walter decoded a number station, which are supposed to be unbreakable. The clues led him to PO Box and he saw a man take a blue airmail envelope out of it and the man saw him. Walter is now totally freaked out.

The woman takes Annie to her son, a young teenager. He gives Annie his numbers station info.

In HQ, Joan greets Jai Willcox, who she doesn't think works for her. He tells her he has orders, she refers to him as CIA royalty.

Annie asks Auggie to look into the numbers station. In return, she gets to fetch lunch. Jai sidles over. Auggie bristles. Auggie explains Jai went to Yale, works for Arthur and his father is Henry Willcox, the former head of clandestine service. Jai's the special liaison new initiatives.

Auggie listens to the station with a tech. They hear music at first, then numbers. Auggie recognizes it as a sophisticated code permutation. Walter might have found an active spy transmission.

Helen Newman calls Annie, saying she's being followed since she left Langley.

Joan briefs the troops. There's a missing person's alert on Helen. The broadcast originated in Belfast. They traced it to the IRA. MI-6 thinks the code is for Michael Cahill, who got out of jail six months ago. He planned previous attacks during Lent, which is on day 20 now. They think something might be imminent.

Annie is assigned to go to the Newman's house with an MI 6 operative. They need Walter's tapes.

Auggie pulls a 1960s piece of equipment out of the CIA vault.

Joan interrupts Arthur meeting. She thinks Arthur sent Jai to spy on Annie, but he assures her it's just for division transparency.

Annie goes to the market and prepares to follow her protocol to authenticate the MI 6 spy. She has an innocuous conversation about honey with a stranger and he gets in her car. He's James Elliot, charming British spy.

They go to the Newman's apartment. They have a fancy door lock, which James picks. That day's mail is unopened.

They find old spy novels on the shelves and in Walter's room, tons of electronic equipment and tons of tapes - except from last week.

James goes to check out the other room. The doorbell rings. Annie looks through the peephole and gets the door slammed in her face. A man throws her around and has the best of her until James comes and shoots him in the forehead.

They're about to leave when Annie goes back to rip out the computer hard drive.

At HQ, Joan is alerted about the shots fired. Annie and James race to the lobby but it's full of people, a cop (or CIA guy disguised as a cop), clears their way out.

In the car, Annie worries about Helen and Walter. She asks James how he stays calm, he says he's just focused. She asks him if the life of a spy is worth giving up a family. He wouldn't know, he never had one. Annie arrives home and sees her nieces.

Out at dinner, Arthur and Joan mix business with their personal life. He tells her he wants things to work between them. Her phone rings.

At home in the morning, Annie examines her bruises. Danielle drops by and Annie tells her she can't be the girls' guardian. Danielle responds by telling Annie she only cares about herself and storming out.

Annie beats the crap out of the heavy bag in the CIA gym. Auggie stops by. Annie's angry she keeps losing hand to hand fights. He gives her some pointers.

In HQ, Joan tells them the guy James killed worked with Cahill and Cahill is on his way in to the city and they plan to pick him up. Annie asks Joan what they're missing about Helen and Walter. His hard drive was useless but Annie thinks they're still in danger and his tapes are key. Joan pushes back, but Jai - who was listening nearby - asks what the harm is in letting Annie follow it up. Joan relents.

After Annie leaves, Joan explains to Jai that she's in charge.

Annie goes back to the Newman's apartment.

In the train station, teams surveille Michael Cahill then escort him away.

Annie goes through everything in the apartment. She picks up the picture of Walter with his dad in front of a sign for a nature cabin. She calls and confirms they're there.

CIA HQ Joan talks to Cahill. He tells her he's a peaceful man now.

Annie drives to the nature cabins. She finds Helen and Walter. She tells Walter he was right and they need his tapes. She apologizes to him and promises he'll be safe. She gets the tapes and plays them for Auggie over her cell phone. He puts them through the ancient machine.

Annie waits and chats with Helen. She mentions they contacted the British intelligence last week. Annie goes to her phone. James said they had no info on them. She remembers James' Nicotine patch and him saying they're halfway there, as in through Lent.

She remembers him messing with her phone and examines it. She finds the bug. He pulls up with two other guys.

Annie hides in the cabin with Walter and Helen. Annie grabs the light bulbs Walter used to rig his hard drive and pulls the gas line out of the stove. Helen and Walter go out through the crawl space. The bag guys open the door and there's a blast. James shoots at them. Annie tackles him.

She gets on top and maces him. Then she knocks him out with a rock.

Later, the cavalry has arrived. Annie talks to Auggie on the phone. He says the plan was for a car bomb outside a British bank and James was a double agent. He set Cahill up, and the guy in the Newman's apartment that he shot to build Annie's trust.

She gets in the police car with James. She asks him if what he said about being a spy and having a family was true. He says it was the only true thing he told her.

Back at HQ, Joan apologizes to Cahill and tells him he's free to go.

In Arthur's office, he asks Jai about Annie. He says she's smart. Arthur wants Jai to get as close to him as he needs to in the hopes they'll get info on Ben Mercer, her mystery man. Arthur says he'll handle Joan.

Annie thanks Walter for his help and Auggie rewards him with top of the line headphones.

Back home, Annie microwaves dinner. Danielle comes in and says Annie's an amazing aunt and she doesn't need a piece of paper to prove she'd be there for her kids. Annie gives Danielle the will she signed 20 minutes ago."

Caracas, Venezuela A group of kids play soccer in the street as a bald dude watches. He approaches another guy and asks who's winning. Suddenly, he's surrounded by men who tell him only the government wins. They shoot at him but he runs. He makes it to his car, where he's quickly garroted to death by his own medallion necklace.

Back on the soccer field, Annie's team loses to a young Latin man who can't stop staring at her. Diego asks her out after the game, saying he'll do anything she asks. She tells him she needs his help getting to his sister Julia.

In Caracas, one of the killers brings his mistress the same necklace.

Annie tells Diego she knows all about his sister, including that she's Victor Ponce's mistress and his personal banker. Over the past few years she's helped skim over $100 million in profits owed US oil companies. She tells him they need to look into the account and see where it's going because they're worried it's going to people who want to destabilize the government.

She tells him they'll protect him and his sister and pay for his education, otherwise his student visa might get canceled. She needs an answer tonight. Auggie sits down on the bench next to Diego after Annie leaves.

He reports back to Joan at HQ and she reminds him he's not supposed to do field work. Annie tells Joan her Smithsonian ID is in place. She wants Annie to escort him to Caracas. Jay reports to Joan that their agent Lopez there is out of touch.

Then he checks in with Annie and reveals he was watching her at soccer.

Diego calls.

At home during morning madness Annie takes in the scene before packing for her trip. She tosses her long lost boyfriend bracelet in, then her sister joins her and tells her to let him go.

In the Caracas airport, Annie looks for Lopez, who she says will be wearing a Bolivar medal around his neck. A woman bumps into her and puts a phone in her hand. It rings, it's Auggie, who points out their agent Rodriguez at the door. Lopez has been out of contact for 72 hours and the station chief is worried. He tells her she might be on her own.

At HQ, Joan and the team try to decide what to do. They're worried they don't have much time if Lopez is dead because it means someone is on to them. They decide to let Annie go ahead.

Diego and Annie go meet his sister, where he introduces Annie as his girlfriend. The sister thinks Annie's too old for her 20 year old brother, but Annie explains she's there for her.

At Julia's house she says Victor is a good man. But Annie tells her he's married, with many mistresses. Annie says Victor will be taken down but she doesn't have to go with him. They want her to tag his account to give them access. Annie gives her a US passport. Julia doesn't like the idea of leaving her home, where she's known as the mother of the neighborhood. Annie cautions her not to get burned by love.

At HQ, Auggie waits to hear from Annie.

Rain pours down in Caracas. Julia doesn't want to prove Victor's guilt, but Annie tells her to do it to prove his innocence.

Annie calls home, saying the account has a password that changes every minute. Victor carries a coded fob and they need it to access the account. She says they're switching Julia's for Victor's the next day after their afternoon delight. Annie and Diego meet up with them. When Victor hears Annie's Smithsonian cover story about looking into a letter Simon Bolivar wrote to James Monroe, he suggests he go look at it with her and Diego drive Julia home, foiling their plan.

One of the agents watching Annie sees that Julia is wearing a Bolivar medallion that he recognizes as belonging to Lopez (who we know Victor had killed). Joan gets a report that Lopez' body has been found in pieces.

Joan and the team decide to proceed. Victor tests Annie's cover story and she proves to know plenty about Bolivar. She and Julia go to the bathroom. Julia tells Annie that Victor gave her the necklace Sunday. Annie tells her she's pretty sure it means Victor killed her colleague. She tells Julia to wait for her at the bank. Julia still doesn't think Annie's right about Victor.

Victor drives like a maniac and asks Annie what she sees in Diego. He thinks she should be dating someone older. He wants her to drive. She grinds the sports car's gears, stops and starts and generally appears like an incompetent driver. He tells her his men searched her car at lunch and found the Bolivar book with relevant parts highlighted.

She comes to a roadblock and can't help but handle it capably. She realizes her cover is blown. She stops and he pulls a gun on her. She unbuckles his seat belt and drives donuts that pin him to his seat as she swats at his gun. A shot rings out, nicking her and shattering her window, then she opens his door, tosses him out and drives off.

Annie calls Auggie. She's bleeding on Victor's car. Auggie directs her to a cabbie with a beard who will take her to the airport. She goes in the bank to get Julia. They sit down at the computer with Victor's code fob as he pulls up outside with his men. The cabbie sees them go in and makes a call. Auggie calls Annie. Julia tags the account and the CIA gets access.

Diego hides from Victor. Julia is having a hard time believing she was wrong about Victor and Annie reminds her he shot her.

At HQ, they see that the money is tied to terrorist groups.

Victor heads for the back as Annie and Julia go out the side door, triggering the alarm. Annie tells her someone else will get Diego. After one last moment of indecision, Julia gets in the car with Annie.

Back in Georgetown, Annie watches soccer with Diego. Julia's having a hard time adapting but Diego isn't worried. They're being moved tomorrow. He joins his sister.

Auggie reassures Annie it was a job well done. He tells her he thinks Joan envies her being able to do field work. Annie watches Diego and Julia and back at HQ she asks if they were able to trace all of Victor's money. He says there were some small accounts in the Caymans they couldn't get into. Annie wants to know where Diego's tuition money comes from -- Julia's account that traces back to the Caymans.

At the safe house, Julia lifts the phone of the agent guarding them.

Auggie and Annie tell Joan that Julia was giving money to kids in the slums and she moved money as recently as yesterday, when she wasn't supposed to have access to phones. They wonder if she would contact Victor.

Cut to Victor coming into the US on a fake passport and receiving a text from Julia. She tells the agent guarding her she's going down for coffee.

Annie arrives at the safehouse to find Julia is gone.

Julia pulls up to a public fountain in a cab. Auggie traces cabs and finds her. Joan tells Annie to stand down, that there are people nearby, but Annie's not listening.

Julia runs up to Victor, saying she knew he'd forgive her. He has her passport. Annie lets the agent go after Julia but Diego bolts, too. She runs after him.

Julia gets in Victor's car as she sees Diego running toward her. Victor's goon in the back seat starts garroting Julia as Victor tells her there's no going back - and then an agent shoots the goon through the back window. Victor tries to drive off. A shot rings out and the car crashes. Victor is dead.

Back home, Annie contemplates her bracelet. She puts it where she can see it, not ready to let go yet."

Annie (Piper Perabo) lands and spies the man she thinks is her contact in the airport. He's carrying a silver briefcase just like hers. But then she sees another man carrying the same one. One is a blond white man and the other is middle Eastern. A smoke bomb goes off and in the confusion the blond man tries to grab Annie's case. She fends him off and his suitcase explodes. It's chaos.

Watching TV at home, Arthur (Peter Gallagher) sees Liza Hearn (Emmanuelle Vaugier) demands more transparency, saying she was assured by Arthur they'd get some. He's still irked by the leaks. Joan (Kari Matchett) makes him shut the TV off and brings him breakfast and newspaper in bed. She redacted everything about geo-politics and redacted the sports page - the Nationals make him crazy.

He starts showing his appreciation, but both of their phones start ringing like crazy. They turn on the news to see the scene in Switzerland. No one was hurt, but they worry they sent Annie into the field too soon.

She calls Auggie (Christopher Gorham). She's in a hooded sweatshirt and carrying the suitcase in a shopping bag. She tells him there were two briefcases in the airport. She's spotted by the police. She tells Auggie she's not going to make it to the Turk's, the secondary drop off.

She wanders into a hotel lobby and hides her suitcase somewhere inside.

Auggie tells Joan that Annie had to drop her package - not their first choice.

Annie walks into the jewelry store and has a conversation with Fatima (Kathleen Gati), the woman behind the counter, to prove herself. The woman says she has a safe house she can take her to and asks for her passport and anything which can ID her.

Joan goes to Arthur's office to show him photos from the scene. Annie was set up. Eyal (Oded Fehr) made it out with his package, too. Arthur hands the extraction off to someone else, telling Joan they can't risk the op being compromised by the leak in her division.

The woman takes Annie to the safe house. She'll bring Annie her new passport soon.

Annie has hair dye and instant mac n' cheese to keep her occupied. In the safe house she's jumped from behind. She quickly realizes it's her contact Eyal. Both wonders what the other is doing there.

Annie doesn't understand how the simple brush-by went bad. He's outraged she dropped her package. He hacks a police scanner.

Arthur meets with Liza in a park. He tells her she broke the rules by mentioning his name on air. She thinks he's making empty threats, but he says she can be the judge if she breaks any more rules.

While Eyal is in the shower, Annie calls Auggie to brainstorm where he might have hid his suitcase. Auggie checks his file and thinks the brush pass is beneath his pay grade.

Eyal gets out of the shower and breaks her phone in two, pointing out someone in one of their agencies spoiled the op.

In Langley, Auggie works to locate Annie when one of Arthur's leak detectors orders him to take a polygraph. Joan tells him to go with it.

Annie is preparing to cut and dye her hair when Eyal calls for her from the other room. He whipped up a little hanger steak with charred eggplant and pine nuts. She won't eat until he tastes it first. He stowed away on a food service truck from the airport.

He looks at the shrapnel cut in her neck and says it needs to be stitched.

Arthur tries to talk to Joan, who's mad at being kept out of the loop. She doesn't even know what's in the briefcases. She says she's the only one he can really trust and he's doing his best to alienate her.

Eyal stitches Annie up. He doesn't know what's in his briefcase either. He says they're just cogs in a wheel. He finds the black leather S & M gear she found earlier.

He asks her where her package is and if she left it with the Turk. They look out the window and see guys arriving in a power company van, but it's Sunday and their shoes are all wrong. One of them is the blond man from the airport.

Soon, they're going through the safe house with guns drawn.

Annie uses the leather gloves from the bondage gear to slide down the elevator cables. The car starts moving and Eyal presses against the wall as it passes. It stops and Annie hears gunshots and sees Eyal running away.

At Langley, Auggie sits for his polygraph. He's not happy about it. When the examiner asks if he's blind, he says no. It doesn't say he's lying. He says he knows how to beat the machine. He's subjected to a lot of questions about his satisfaction with his job.

In Switzerland, Annie goes back to the jewelry store. She finds her initial contact dead. Eyal comes in and she handcuffs him. He swears she was dead when he got there.

She remembers in the airport he put his sunglasses on before the flash bangs went off. She calls Langley but gets one of Arthur's guys instead of Auggie. Eyal tries to convince her to use him, even if she can't trust him. He has her passport. She hangs up.

Auggie's examiner asks him if he wants to punish the agency for what happened to him. He asks if he's Liza's source. Auggie says no. The machine doesn't budge.

Annie and Eyal go to get her briefcase. He keeps trying to guess where it is. She takes him to the hotel ballroom where she hid it. There's a wedding underway and it's under the bride's chair.

Arthur tells Joan the Zurich operation was compromised on the Mossad side by the blond guy, a former agent.

Annie and Eyal mingle. He recognizes an off-duty police officer. They dance to blend. Eyal breaks off to ask the bride to dance so Annie can grab the package. But she says no, she's in a cast from a biking accident. Annie sees the bride glaring at the groom, who's on his way to drunken idiocy.

Annie takes the groom to the bar to do shots until the bride comes over to yell at him. Annie walks away and finds the package is gone. She thinks Eyal has bailed, but he pulls up outside with both packages.

In the car, he tells her he was sent on the mission because he missed a ferry so the guy he was escorting could say good-bye to his kid. He didn't follow protocol.

He's driving to another safe house out of town - when their car is nailed by a speeding SUV.

The bad blond Mossad and his guys get out. Eyal and Annie are OK and he comes out shooting, taking the blond guy out. Annie grabs her suitcase but the two are quickly surrounded by cops.

The officer runs up and tells them they have planes to catch.

At the airport, Eyal says he knew the bad guys were Mossad by the way they stormed the safe house. Annie says he owes Langley an apology. He agrees. ""Plus, I'm horribly embarrassed by their inability to take us out, it's a national disgrace that you and I are still walking.""

With their flights called, they finally make their exchange. He suggests the beaches in Israel next time.

At home, Joan and Arthur lie in bed. She asks him if he read her in about Zurich as her boss or husband. He doesn't know how to answer.

Annie lands in the U.S. and hands off her suitcase, mission complete."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1695468/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,Annie is given the difficult task of asking a reclusive former officer for assistance as the agency tries to track down an African arms dealer who is trying to enter the United States.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jonathan Glassner'],"['', '', '']",[],"['woman wears a red dress', 'arms dealer', 'fly fishing', 'brooklyn shipyard', 'sniper', 'double barreled shotgun', 'fishing', 'shell bracelet', 'title based on song', 'reference to led zeppelin']",[],"Annie (Piper Perabo) brings Auggie (Christopher Gorham) coffee on her morning run and gets her a spiffy new cell phone in return. An agent races by her into Joan's office.

They've got a line on three surface-to-air missiles on a container ship from South Africa. They'll be in the US in the next 24 hours. They don't know where, but the shipper is Hassan Walid.

On a cargo ship, the captain demands more money for bribes but Walid shoots him dead and asks other crew members if they want more money as well. Understandably, none do.

Joan (Kari Matchett) and the team brainstorm. Jai (Sendhil Ramamurthy) suggests checking in with Amsterdam. Someone suggests McAuley. There's a pregnant pause.

Joan tells Annie to track down ""McAuley."" ""You're new, you might have a shot,"" Joan says.

Later, Annie asks Auggie what she meant. Christopher McAuley (Eriq La Salle) was a deep cover officer for 15 years and knew everything about east Africa. He retired five years ago, meaning he had a nervous breakdown. Auggie tells her pretty much every senior person has tried to bring him in. Annie realizes she's on a fool's errand.

Jai greets his dad, the former director Henry Wilcox (Gregory Itzin).

Auggie generally disapproves of him, saying he ran more dark ops than anyone since the Cold War. He tells her the story about Henry and Jai's mom. She was his asset when he was in India, her cover was blown, he married her and then he left her for a younger woman.

She says the press called him ""the Prince of Darkness."" Jai walks up in time to hear. Auggie excuses himself. Jai asks her for coffee, then it becomes drinks and talks of dating.

Annie drives down a country road until her tire blows - or more accurately, is popped by spike strips. Dogs come after her. Then the presumed Chris McAuley comes out. He guesses she's from Langley and tells her to get off his property. She says she has a flat tire. He replies he hopes that she has a spare. What a gentleman.

Back at Langley, Jai reports Hassan's cousin worked at the Johannesburg port which is how the missiles got on the ship. Worse, they now know Hassan is on the ship himself.

Annie changes her tire on Cauley's property. She's about to leave but goes looking for him. She subdues his dogs with treats.

She finds him fishing in a stream in waders. He ignores her so she takes off her heels and wades in. He guesses she's new. She tells him about the weapons shipment. He ignores her and works on his fly casting. She takes it and ties it for him.

She tells him it's for the greater good. But he says the only mud he likes is the kind he's standing in. When she asks what he means, he tells her to ask Henry Wilcox.

Annie drives back to the city. She remembers her time on the beach with Ben (Eion Bailey), as he taught her how to tie lures. She tells him about growing up as a military brat and wanting to be the master of her own destiny.

Khartoum, Sudan A man walks into his house and sees Ben Mercer waiting for him. He reaches for his knife as Ben asks where his boss is: Hassan Walid. The man draws his knife and Ben fends him off. They fight all over the house until Ben gets him in a chokehold. He asks again where Walid is but the man passes out.

Annie gets drinks with Auggie and he calls her out for staring at the Wilcoxes across the room. Annie decides to go join them, based on what McAuley said. Auggie playfully whines about being left alone. Annie assures him another girl will join him as soon as she leaves. Sure enough, a girl sits and says, ""Hi"" before Annie even takes 5 steps away.

Jai's clearly irked she's butting in, but she orders scotch and makes herself at home. They're several rounds in when Henry calls her out for disapproving of him. He gives a little speech about things not being black and white.

Annie asks why people leave the company. Henry says it's always for money or love.

Annie goes back to Langley and reads up on McAuley. She sees he was station chief in Khartoum. She looks at the agents he was stationed with and finds Vanessa Sinclair, killed in action in 2005.

Annie's sitting in the lobby when Auggie joins her. She asks about the girl. He says she couldn't remember the title of the last book she read, which was a deal-breaker. She asks him how he feels about what they do. She wonders if it's worth it. She thinks he might have something she can use with McAuley, but she's torn.

Annie wakes up and sees her Ben bracelet. She wears it when she goes again to see McAuley. She tells him she wants to talk about Vanessa.

She tells him he's trying to scare people off, but she thinks it's an act. She knows Vanessa worked for Henry's dark ops group. Every vacation he took for 10 years was in the same area where Vanessa as stationed.

""I know what it's like to hang onto a memory,"" she tells him.

He sees the bracelet and the knot and asks if she loved the person who taught her that. Very much, she says.

She recites Vanessa was killed five years ago in Sudan, her death was tied to Hassan Walid. She tells him to work his contacts for her, if not the greater good. He's impressed.

""You're talented enough to go very far in this business, and foolish enough to want to,"" he tells her.

Joan reports to Arthur (Peter Gallagher) that Annie got McAuley, but he wants to take her to see his contact in New York. He also needs $250,000 for the contact. Arthur tells her to send Jai and $100,000 should work.

Arthur's secretary tells him Henry Wilcox is there to see him.

Arthur stalls then finally sees him. Henry knows one of the cases they're working is Hassan Walid. He suggests they turn him rather than locking him up. ""There are some stories that will do no one any good to have out in the open,"" Henry says.

Auggie gives Annie and Jai a suitcase full of money, explaining each bill has an RFID signal and many together can be traced.

New York City Jai, Annie and McAuley wait for his contact. McAuley offers up out of nowhere to Jai that his father is an ""a--hole."" Jai doesn't argue. McAuley goes to meet his contact, contrary to the plan. Annie whips out her smart phone to show Jai the video she just took of everyone walking by. She calls Auggie to have him trace the people.

Annie chats with Jai until McAuley comes back, with the case. He reports his contact said he didn't trust him, then excuses himself to go to the bathroom. Annie thinks his demeanor was all wrong. They open the case and find phone books. They go in the coffee shops to look for him and discover he's gone.

They check in with Langley. Annie thinks McAuley got info he could use. They trace the money to a restaurant owned by a guy named Sadiq. Joan gives them the green light to go in.

Jai finds a secret door then a brick wall with loose bricks. He pulls out a piece of the wall and finds drugs and guns and their money.

Annie and Jai sit down with Sadiq.

Joan reports to Arthur that Walid is on the SS Andromeda docking in Brooklyn. She's ready to send in the FBI, but Arthur says they're going to run the op.

Jai and Annie get orders to go back to Langley. But Annie feels responsible. She hails a cab to the Brooklyn shipyard.

When Annie and Jai pull up, a team is already on the scene. Auggie gets a report. Annie and Jai are there. They find McAuley with a rifle. She tells them this isn't his fight. She thinks the FBI is coming. He tells her the CIA gave Hassan his start and he killed Vanessa when she brought him guns and money - and the CIA went on working with him until he turned on them.

Joan gives the command for them to take Hassan alive. McAuley tells Annie to get out of the way, but she won't. He gives in.

They hear a shot ring out. Hassan falls. Back in Langley, they try to figure out what happened. Arthur demands to know who fired.

We see who it was: Annie's mystery lover Ben Mercer.

Ben tosses his rifle and scales the boat to escape. He runs down the dock, coming up right behind Annie. She doesn't look his way but Jai does. He takes off after Ben. Jai has nearly caught up when Ben gets the drop on him. With gun drawn, Ben stares down Jai but lets him go.

McAuley examines the missiles: US made, the same ones the CIA sold him.

Arthur leads the dedication of the new ops center in Henry Wilcox's name, pledging transparency.

Auggie hears Jai giving an interview and says he's a blowhard like his dad. But Annie defends him, saying he's just trying to figure this place out.

Joan confronts Arthur, saying he knew those weapons were theirs. He admits Hassan was an asset who built his entire operation on their guns and money. They sent Vanessa Sinclair to deliver a shipment. He killed her, then used the weapons they'd given him to build a terrorist cell. Arthur said he didn't know until Wilcox told him. They were both there when Wilcox started the op.

They know it was Ben Mercer who killed Hassan.

Cut to Ben wounded and drinking Scotch by himself. He looks at a picture of Annie on his cell' phone."

They're also not going to the Greenbriar next week like they planned.

At work, Annie razzes Auggie (Christopher Gorham) for wearing the same clothes he was wearing yesterday. He won't tell her who he spent the night with.

Joan (Kari Matchett) tells Auggie he's on a special assignment this week.

In the conference room, Joan shows the team footage of a drone - the compromised third mission in two weeks . They've narrowed the leak down to a member of the Senate intelligence committee.

The briefing rooms they use are secure, not even note-taking is allowed. Jai (Sendhil Ramamurthy) says the mission is completely off-book. They're using the young agents because they'll blend on capitol hill.

Annie has Gil Jarvis (D.W. Moffett), the committee chair. They're pretty sure he's not the leak.

Annie reports to the senator's office with her Smithsonian cover, saying she's there to switch out the art. Gil says his wife Madeline (Lauren Holly) does all the decorating. She meets Gil's very young chief of staff Ashley (Anna Camp) and listens to her telling Jarvis she has to brief him on Pakistan.

Later, Annie takes a painting off the wall with the help of a maintenance guy. She recognizes his accent as Brazilian and butters him up speaking Portuguese. He mentions the senator works late on Tuesdays. She takes note of his key card.

Annie riding back to Langley when she goes by a hotel and sees her brother-in-law coming out.

At Langley, Annie tells Jai about the secret Tuesday meetings. He tells her to go back and dig, but avoid getting caught.

Annie goes to the storage area, claiming she needs to get a priceless painting she left there. She goes to Frederico's locker and takes his time card and goes up to the senator's office.

She finds a light on inside and opens the door. She sees Ashley with her shirt off climbing onto the senator's lap.

Back at Langley, she asks Auggie how to get a duplicate swipe card. Army guys bring computers in for Auggie. She tells him about seeing her brother-in-law coming out of a hotel.

Jai has found Jarvis' charges at restaurants that indicate Ashley isn't his first mistress.

Annie hears Auggie talking with his old Army buddies on video conference.

Annie jogs down to the docks to ""run into"" Ashley after she rows. They go get coffee.

Annie comes home in time to see Michael leaving with another excuse. Danielle tells Annie he's working out of Baltimore this week, every day.

Joan tells Auggie she needs him back from his special assignment. He asks her to leave him on it because it's guys from his old unit.

Annie arrives at the senator's office to see Madeline chatting with an old college friend who's now married to the Indonesian ambassador. Before they leave, Annie watches Madeline take a flash drive from a staffer's laptop.

Ashley comes in and Annie convinces her to blow off work.

At the bar, Annie butters up Ashley with girl-talk bonding, then offers up she thinks the senator likes Ashley. Ashley tells Annie their marriage isn't what it seems and she's in love with him. She says he's going to leave his wife.

Later, Annie reports in to Jai about Ashley's dish. She thinks Ashley wouldn't have blabbed if she were the leak. She asks Jai to look into Tina Varma, the wife of the Indonesian ambassador.

Annie sneaks back in the senator's office. A security guy does a late night check. Annie finds a letter supposedly from the senator about Ashley selling secrets and snaps a picture. It's a resignation speech. Madeline wrote it, planning to frame Ashley.

Joan holds a conference, telling everyone they'll pick up Madeline and have her feed bogus intel to her contacts to flush them out.

Annie tells Auggie she's sure Michael is lying to Danielle. Auggie's bummed because he thinks his old buddies don't have confidence in him. Annie gives him a pep talk.

Annie tails Madeline with a team of agents. She goes into a book store and leaves something in a book then hails a cab.

Annie goes to hail a cab and runs smack into her brother in law. He tells her it's not what she thinks and asks her not to tell.

Annie watches as Madeline has lunch with her old friend Tina. Tina tells her she knows it's been hard, but she did the right thing.

When Tina leaves, Annie sits down with Mrs. Jarvis, asking her to come to Langley.

Joan meets with Madeline at Langley. She says Tina told her no one would get hurt. She says she helped get her husband where he is, but he changed.

Joan tells Annie that Ashley has to take the fall so the Indonesians will buy that their contact is still safe. Joan says workplace romances are always complicated, and the camera meaningfully shows Jai.

Auggie leads his mission and Annie sees him and is convinced to look at the bigger picture. Annie goes to see Ashley.

At Langley, Gil meets with Madeline. Jai asks to speak to Joan outside.

Jai points out if they frame Ashley the Indonesian will want to tie up the loose end. Joan sends him after her.

On the dock, Annie explains how Madeline framed her. She took notes from the senator after his briefings and he divulged classified information. Her notes and Internet searches are the only paper trail.

Gil tells Joan the names of the operations his wife leaked. One of them is Goliath, the mission Auggie is currently running. Joan goes to tell him, but he says they're already radio silent.

Auggie scrambles to re-establish contact.

Annie waits for Ashley as she puts away her rowing gear, then realizes a guy she saw earlier on the dock left his skull on the water. From her car, Annie watches as he comes up on Ashley with a syringe and the garage door closes in front of her.

Annie runs around for another way in and uses an oar to take out Ashley's attacker. But he gets free and runs after Ashley, knocking Annie down and dazing her. The guy is choking Ashley with a chain when Annie shoots a flare gun at him, then essentially beats him up with a racing skull, bouncing him off it.

Back with Auggie, they're out of ways to contact the team until Auggie suggests they smash the drone into the compound his guys are approaching. He says they'll get the warning.

They crash the drone and wait to hear. The mission abort signal comes through from the guys. They're OK.

At the racing club, Jai pulls up and is relieved to see Annie is OK. Annie tells Ashley with her attacker in custody she won't need to take the fall.

Cut to Senator Jarvis's resignation press conference.

Back home outside, Michael tells Annie he lost his job two months ago. He was at a job fair at the hotel. Annie urges him to tell Danielle the truth.

Jarvis apologizes to his wife and Ashley in a press conference as we see Ashley packing up.

From her room in the guest house, Annie can see Michael telling Danielle and her hugging him."

At Langley, dozens of analysts try to figure out what has just happened to their computers. Traffic lights all flash red.

At home, Danielle (Anne Dudek) complains about the internet not working. The TV is out, too. She's got a photo shoot set up to launch a catering business and gets Annie (Piper Perabo) to pose.

Liza Hearn (Emmanuelle Vaugier), the reporter who's been aggravating Arthur (Peter Gallagher) and writing things about the CIA, tells someone in the other room the cable is out. It's Auggie (Christopher Gorham). She says he's not the only one he knows at the CIA (so maybe he's not the leak). He's ready to stay and play house more when he hears his phone is out, too. He wonders if it's the 13th already.

At work, Auggie tells Joan (Kari Matchett) it wasn't an accident. The Data Tech conference starts today. He wants to go in. She tells him it's already set up.

Data Tech is 1,000 hackers sitting down with law enforcement to swap ideas. Joan briefs the troops on the cyber attack. The hack looks like one in 2007, except it took advantage of something they'd never seen before.

They think Natasha Petrovna (Liane Balaban) might be behind the attack. Auggie explains she's his ex-girlfriend.

She's from Russia. She just spent two years in prison for a hack.

They want Auggie to negotiate a consulting deal with her. Auggie thinks Natasha is an idealist and won't go for money.

Auggie points out to Joan if he makes the deal, she'll know he's a spy. Joan realizes.

Jai (Sendhil Ramamurthy) brings Annie photos security wants taken down from the Internet. They're the ones Danielle took that morning.

Annie takes Auggie to his place to change into a Super Mario Bros 1Up t-shirt. At Data Tech, Auggie briefs her on what the various types look like.

The people on the dais are former criminals now consulting. Natasha asks a question of the FBI about warrantless wiretaping.

Annie narrates for Auggie, telling him Natasha appears to be turning down money from fancy Europeans.

Auggie stops her. Natasha slaps him. ""I didn't see that coming,"" he says. When she says he should have, he explains he meant it literally, because he's blind.

She says she waited for him at Kincaid's but he never showed and two days later she was arrested. He tells her he wants in on her hack.

Outside, he offers her the $2 million and she's surprised he doesn't know her well enough to know she's not in it for the money. He says he has to offer, for his company.

She says his company can have her code when she releases it wide tomorrow.

He has to tell her he works for the CIA. She walks away.

Driving home, Auggie tells Annie that he and Natasha dated for over a year. He loved her. He says he asked permission to keep dating her but the bosses told him no. The FBI had her in a sting and he couldn't protect her.

Auggie and Annie return to Langley. Joan tells him he has to go back tomorrow.

Joan says what she's asking is the right thing for Natasha. He agrees.

Back home, Annie tries to talk about her day. She is surprised by Auggie's ex. She also thinks he's sleeping with someone he hasn't told her about.

Danielle shows her the catering website, with Annie's face all over it. Annie asks her to take the pictures down. She says she wants the people at work to think of her as professional. Danielle is put out.

Annie arrives for Auggie at his house. His phone rings, the voice announces it's Liza Hearn, the reporter. Annie waits for an explanation. Finally he says they're dating. She thinks he's the leak.

He says he's running an op on Liza, working her to get to her source. He hasn't told Joan because he doesn't want her to give the ""job"" to someone else.

""James Bond was a lonely, sad old man,"" Annie says. She doesn't believe Auggie's the kind of guy who would exploit a woman for intel. He points out that's exactly what he's being asked to do with Natasha.

Outside the conference, Auggie sits down with Natasha and openly shows her the wire he's wearing and points out Annie and Jai across the street.

Auggie tells Natasha the CIA made him break up with her. It was the hardest thing he ever did and after he went to Iraq to get away and ended up blind.

Annie feels odd listening in, but Jai points out he could be lying. Annie sees FBI approaching.

Auggie tells Natasha he can't protect her if she walks away. She gets up to walk away and an SUV speeds toward her. Auggie calls for her hand to pull her out of the way and they narrowly miss the car.

But when Auggie gets up to dust himself off, Natasha is gone.

Back at Langley, they have traffic cam footage of the guys driving, the Europeans who were arguing with Natasha. They're Russian mob, which means it's FBI jurisdiction. Auggie can't believe he's about to be forced to bail on Natasha again.

Auggie goes home to find Natasha there. She suggests maybe he might want to change his locks after giving her his key.

She tells him she got wrapped into the Russian mob doing small jobs at first. Now they want the hack. They think they own her code.

She wants to take her in, but she takes his phone apart.

He tries to convince her to trust someone.

The next day, Auggie is late to work, which is strictly against the rules.

Annie and Jai go to his house and find his phone, ID and keys on the counter. They also find Natasha's scarf.

Cut to Auggie on a train with Natasha. Jai and Annie report in to Joan. Annie finds a receipt for a pre-paid credit card. They search the area and find a card nearby was used to buy tickets on Amtrak to Montreal.

Auggie continues to try to convince Natasha to go in to the CIA. He also listens to find Canadian passengers because he needs their pass. They approach a couple.

Back at Langley, Annie argues Auggie left the clues for them to find. Jai thinks he's actually helping Natasha get to Canada.

Joan wants them to find Auggie before the FBI does. She sends Annie and Jai to the plane.

The FBI stops the train, but doesn't find them. We see Auggie and Natasha on a passing train. She reminds Auggie he used to be buttoned down and asks what happened. He winks at her.

She doesn't believe he broke up with her because the CIA told him to. He reminds her she didn't want to move to DC and didn't want kids. She kisses him. Luckily, they have a private sleeping car. They make use of it.

Jai reads a flight mid-air reporting Auggie wasn't on the train. Annie reiterates she trusts Auggie, she's sure she's right. Jai reminds her what Auggie's doing is against protocol. Annie remembers protocol is to travel unpredictably and the track splits at Albany.

Annie and Jai check the other train.

There's a knock at Auggie's compartment. When Natasha answers, two thugs bust in. Auggie tells Natasha to hit the lights and fights the men off in the dark. A gunshot takes out the window.

Annie hears it.

Auggie fights until one goes out the window and the other is knocked out. He and Natasha are fine. He tells her to get dressed to jump off the train.

The FBI is lined up waiting to search when they stop.

Natasha tells Auggie she'll go on her own, but he won't abandon her again. She asks what if she doesn't have the code? He says he'd still help. She gives him a flash drive with the source code, saying it's everything he needs. She kisses him and tells him she loves him. Then she jumps off the train.

She walks away safely and watches him pull away. He's helpless to find her.

He finds Annie and Jai in the hallway. Jai asks where Natasha is, but Auggie hands him the flash drive in response. Annie says I told you so.

Auggie tells Joan he's not sure he was always just working the situation like an op. She says emotions are part operations, a compliment. Then she warns him not to do what he did ever again. He doesn't expect to hear from Natasha ever again.

Annie's waiting in his office. She asks what he's going to do about Liza Hearn. He says he's going to get as much info as he can, then he's going to end it. She says it's OK with her, she trusts him.

Back home, Annie apologizes to Danielle and shoots photos of her for the site.

Auggie comes home. Liza Hearn is there."

Annie (Piper Perabo) is on the ground next to a woman's body. She's holding a gun. She's trying to figure out what's going on when police approach her and take her into custody.

Back at Langley, Joan (Kari Matchett) is mad at Arthur (Peter Gallagher) for putting Annie in harm's way to draw out Ben Mercer (Eion Bailey). She just wants Annie out of federal custody.

Cut to Annie shackled to a desk. The same FBI guy she met while playing hooker comes in to interview her. He recognizes her.

She says she works for the Smithsonian.

Outside the room, the agent is upset to learn Annie's lawyer is there despite the fact Annie hasn't been allowed to make a phone call. We see the lawyer. It's Joan. The fed isn't buying it and tells her he wants intra-agency support.

Joan talks to Annie, asking her why she's there. She wants details. Annie's in shock. Joan tells her to start at the beginning.

Two Days Earlier Annie attends an auction at Bramble's as part of her Smithsonian cover. An attractive private art buyer flirts with her. The bidding starts, he's up to $3 million and Annie thinks something is amiss. A man blurts out $10 million and gets the piece.

Annie looks at her notes again, trying to figure out why it went for way more than it was worth.

Back at Langley, Annie asks Auggie (Christopher Gorham) if she should report it given someone circled the item in her notes. He tells her to.

Jai (Sendhil Ramamurthy) checks with Annie they're on for her family bbq.

Later, at the bbq, Danielle (Anne Dudek) peppers Jai with questions. He says he's just a suit.

Inside, Danielle declares Jai ""the George Clooney of where ever's he's from."" and comments on his cheekbones.

Later, Jai walks Annie to the door. He says he understands some relationships take time to get over and he'll be around.

Back in her place, Annie's aglow as she takes her shoes off. She turns around and there's Ben.

He tells her that he was in love with her, and leaving her is the hardest thing he ever had to do. However, she would have been in danger if he'd stayed. He tells her he was with the Agency. She realizes it was Ben who saved her on the train tracks. He's on his own now.

She ask why he's there. He tells her to look into the painting. He says the guy who bought the painting is named Hillburn, the number two for an arms dealer, they use the auction to move money.

""So just to be clear, you're not asking for forgiveness, you're asking for a favor?"" Annie asks. She asks him what he wants her to do. He tells her to ask Bramble's director Sophie Jaclin (Sienna Guillory) about specific lots from February and bring her into Langley. He tells her to use his name and mention Mona Lisa if she doesn't believe her.

He says the agency is using her to get to him. He tells her not to trust Joan and Arthur. ""Maybe I don't deserve this, but I'm asking you to trust me,"" he says.

The next day, Annie looks up Ben on the computer. She gets an access denied message. Auggie hears. She tries Sophie Jacklin and gets the same message.

Back in custody, Annie tells Joan that Sophie told her about the auction.

Cut to Annie going to see Sophie, and asking about the lots Ben told her about.

Sophie makes a call as she shows Annie into her office. Annie mentions the arms dealer, Mourrat. Sophie asks what agency Annie is with. Then she pulls a gun on her.

Annie tells Sophie she's there to help. She mentions Ben and calls her Mona Lisa. Sophie believes her. Ben was her contact at the agency, but she thought he was dead.

Annie asks Sophie to come with her. Sophie says they have to hurry because Hillburn is on the way - that's who she was on the phone with.

They're going out a back door when Hillburn's two men stop her. A security guard surprises them and after one of Hillburn's men shoot him, Annie and Sophie run into the warehouse.

The men follow.

Sophie offers Annie her gun, but Annie tells her to take it and head for the dock. Annie grabs a vase from the shelf and throws it for a distraction. She makes her way until she's on the other side of a shelf of art from one of the goons. She pushes it on him and the shelf hits an electrical box, which starts a fire.

She goes down an aisle but runs smack into another goon. A shot rings out and he falls. Sophie announces her gun apparently works. Another man comes up behind Annie and grabs her. She fights him off for a while and he socks her in the jaw. She's knocked down and groggy. She reaches for the gun on the floor near her. The other goon approaches Sophie and they shoot each other.

The sprinklers kick in. We're back at the beginning with Annie getting up with a gun in her hand and Sophie lying on the ground.

In interrogation, Joan clarifies Annie says Sophie tipped her to the overbid and then denied anything was wrong. Annie says she was worried she was being watched.

The FBI agent comes in and shows Joan a file. It confirms two men in the shoot out were Turkish, which is why she's in federal custody.

At Langley, Auggie tells Jai only that he's found Annie deleted her browsing history.

In interrogation, Annie pauses before she answers Joan's question. Joan thinks Annie's stalling. Annie says the overbid was for a Russian missile guidance system - what Ben told her. So what were the Turks doing there?

Joan asks if Sophie told her who her first handler was. Annie says no.

Jai waits outside Annie's place for Danielle to leave then he breaks in. He goes through Annie's stuff and reports little findings to Auggie. Auggie says Annie was looking into pretty classified stuff. He asks Jai if he's ever heard of anyone named Ben Mercer. Jai says no as he finds a photo of Ben with Annie in her album.

Jai makes a call.

Joan answers but says nothing. She asks Annie what she was searching for in confidential databases. Annie says art. Joan tells her she doesn't believe her and says she'll leave her to federal prosecution if she doesn't tell the truth. She asks about Ben Mercer.

Jai watches security footage from the auction house, including Sophie pulling a gun on Annie in her office.

Annie asks if Ben was why she was recruited. Joan asks if she's seen him. Annie says yes.

Joan steps out to meet with Jai. He tells her Annie went to Sophie. They know she looked into Ben.

Joan goes back in to talk to Annie, announcing no more games. She says Ben is a liar. She wants the name of the buyer or she'll leave her there to be prosecuted.

Cut to Annie coming back to work with Joan.

Joan tells Annie that Ben went rogue. Annie wants more information and Joan shouts her down, saying she could be fired or tried for treason for what she did. Annie asks again if they're using her to get to Ben.

Annie goes to see Auggie. He says even if he knew about Ben, he couldn't tell her. Annie tells Auggie she has to work with the FBI on the shooting. Auggie says that's a huge break and that Joan must like her.

Annie feels guilty about Sophie.

Outside the auction house, Annie pulls up with Agent Rosabi (Noam Jenkins). They check out the crime scene. He tells her not to get lost in the guilt. Rosabi knocks over a statue and they agree the bad guys left it teetering.

They check out the painting and find its box is empty.

The security guard sees someone carrying it out on the footage and goes to investigate. Annie and Rosabi follow the trail and find the security guard, shot dead. They realize they just missed the painting.

Back at Langley, Joan sends Annie home.

Back home, Annie lights a candle. She remembers Ben left it there. It has a marina and boat name inside, Casablanca II.

Annie goes to the boat. She finds the hot guy from the auction and the old guy who overbid. The hot guy is Hillburn. She sees the missile plans.

Hillburn tells his guys to kill her. They march her down the dock, she head butts one and uses a spare oar to take out the other. She makes a run for it onto another boat. She leaps from boat to boat as they follow. She leaps onto one boat and misses, ending up holding onto the prow. The goon jumps behind her and lands in the water, but grabs her leg. Hanging on, she grabs the anchor and drops it on the guy's head. She's swimming back to the dock when the other guy has a gun on her.

But Jai and other agents come up behind her. Joan had them follow her.

Joan reports to Arthur. She thinks Ben wanted to make sure Sophie was brought in before he took down Hillburn. ""Sometimes men can be misguided when they think they're helping women,"" she tells him.

She says they're not using Annie as bait anymore. He says it's not her call and Annie is in it whether she wants to be or not. Joan isn't pleased."

Inside, one of them stuffs papers into his waistband and zips up, ready to leave when another comes back with take out. The first guy leaves, saying he's going to go workout. He manages to evade the very large Iranian watching him and makes a run for it.

At Langley, Annie (Piper Perabo) works late. Joan (Kari Matchett) checks on her. Annie says she's fine but Joan asks about the note the tech division spent six hours analyzing this week. It's the one Ben left her saying: ""The truth is complicated. Forgive me.""

Joan tells her she needs to accept and move on.

Annie takes a bath at home when Danielle (Anne Dudek) busts in on her, hiding from Michael. Danielle is upset Michael scheduled a golf trip at Hilton Head over their tenth wedding anniversary. He says it's with his new boss and he has to. Danielle begs Annie to go with her on their anniversary trip instead.

Meanwhile, the Iranian hails a cab and asks how close his $63 dollars will get him to America.

Danielle and Annie head to Niagra Falls for their getaway - the honeymoon suite.

Reporter Liza Hearn (Emmanuelle Vaugier) hangs around Auggie's apartment as they dress following a sleep-over. She asks him why a nice guy like him works at the CIA. She mentions a shipping company called the Albion group. He reminds her about their deal: she doesn't pump him for information and he doesn't ask her about her sources.

Arthur (Peter Gallagher) and Joan sit in marriage counseling at Langley. They start arguing and then ask their therapist what his security clearance is. Later, he waits outside while they continue discussing Annie. Joan thinks Annie is stressed and they might lose her. She mentions Annie's days off and Arthur tells her about the Iranian who just contacted them. He's at the border and Arthur wants him vetted - Annie's closest.

Annie and Danielle enjoy their fancy suite on the Canadian side. Danielle mentions again Annie can't hold onto her Sri Lanka love affair forever.

Annie is thinking wistfully about Ben when Auggie (Christopher Gorham) calls. She tells Danielle she's going running and picks up the guy, who introduces himself as Yahya. He doesn't have his passport because the delegation holds onto it when they travel.

He's a big fan of all things American, including loud music and spy movies, and that he wants to defect, and to get a big house in West Orange, New Jersey. Annie demands some identity proof, he says he had to leave his passport at the embassy, and shows her a picture of two teenagers, a boy and a girl side by side. She asks if they're his children, he looks embarrassed and returns to a fast speech about something different, eluding an answer.

Annie demands to evaluate what he has to offer, and Yahya shows a thick envelope hidden under his zipped sweater. Annie calls Langley and says Yahya claims it's evidence of Iran buying military technology in violation of UN sanctions. Joan asks Annie to fax the info. Jai (Sendhil Ramamurthy) says he's not a high priority target. They don't have any info on his family.

Annie is reminding them she's on vacation with her sister when she hears Danielle yelling in the parking lot. Danielle had seen Yahya in her car, eating her bar of candy, and is yelling as if he was going to rob her car sitting on the passenger's seat. When Annie gets to them, Danielle is threatening to call the police. Annie explains Yahya is an Iranian dissident helping the Smithsonian Museum to recover art pieces that were looted when Tehran fell. Yahya goes along with it, and says something about romantic encounters at Niagara Falls.

That changes Danielle's mood; she apologizes and suggests she and Yahya go sightseeing. Annie tries to keep Danielle away from Yahya and says he and her have to send some faxes. Danielle practically sends Annie away to fax whatever she has by herself. Yahya understands not to blow her cover, and seems happy with the company of the smiling blue eyed blonde.

Annie buys a fax machine and starts feeding pages through. She remembers market shopping in Sri Lanka with Ben (Ian Bailey) and seeing him yelling at a dark skinned man in the market. Then Ben suggests they go to the beach to hide from the world.

At the Falls, Danielle unloads her marital woes on Yahya. He tells her he was arranged to be married when he was 14, tells his bride name, shows Danielle the picture of him with his betrothed - the same photo he had shown Annie in the car - and that he knows she moved to the US, married, and he just saw on Facebook that she was divorcing, so he's hoping to see her again soon as that's the reason he's defecting.

Jai brings Joan Yahya's translated information, which shows they're smuggling booze and cigarettes, not weapons. They think he'd make a great asset and want him to go home. Annie doesn't think he's up for it and says so. Joan says it's not her call.

Yahya worries what will happen to him if he goes back. Annie tells him he knew what could happen when he contacted the agency and seems to be talking about herself. Yahya runs away from Annie, and robs a small fluffy bear from a man in the street who doesn't even notice it.

Joan tells Annie she looked for Yahya at all the hotels. Joan says they're sending up people from the Iranian delegation and Annie did all she could.

Arthur brings Auggie into his office, mentioning a photo. Auggie guesses what it's about (we see a compromising photo of Auggie with Liza) and tells him he's working Liza as an op. He tells Arthur that Liza mentioned the Albion Group. Arthur likes that Auggie refused to help her at first request. He wants Auggie to tell her a story only 17 people in the world know it's a lie. If she finds out quickly it's bogus, the leak is one of those 17. Arthur doesn't want Joan to know what he's doing so she can't get hit by the fallout of whatever happens.

Annie joins Danielle at the pool. Danielle mentions Yahya's betrothed and she helped Yahya call her. Rutaba is on her way up from Jersey to meet him on The Fall's observation deck in an hour.

Annie calls Jai, who's worried Yahya is a plant. She doubts Iran has that much of a sense of humor.

Joan goes looking for Auggie and is told he's meeting with Arthur. She's not pleased.

Auggie meets with Liza on a park bench and tells her about a ship in 2007 which left Marseilles with something in its hold. He gives her the name Joaquim Kuyper, in Maputo, Mozambique. He tells her Kuyper is CIA, and a member of the Albion Group. She asks why the change of heart. He says maybe he just needed a friend outside the agency to question him.

Annie looks for Yahya on the observation deck and remembers a thunderstorm in Sri Lanka with Ben. She's supposed to fly home the next day. He tells her to change her ticket. He sees a mysterious figure and seems about to tell her something, but he stops. Instead, he goes to talk to the man, leaving her displeased.

Annie finds Yahya on the deck through the paid binoculars. Down on the deck, a woman approaches him, and hugs him hello. Jai calls Annie and tells her they talked to Rutaba. She had a change of heart and is still in Jersey. Down on the deck, an Iranian goon with the woman pulls a gun on Yahya. Joan tells Annie to stand down and the Canadian authorities are on the way. Annie hesitates between following the order, or protecting Yahya herself, but mumbles ""Yes,"" to Joan before cutting the mobile off.

Annie runs down the steps, darting sideway glances to the observation deck; first she sees the three going together in the crowd of visitors leaving the place in their yellow waterproof vests, then she loses sight of them. The three are going through the corridors, Yahya talking loud in English trying to call some of the guards' attention, but fails. The Iranian pair forces him through an underground passage closed to the public.

Annie arrives at a crossroad, having lost her targets, but on the floor she sees the fluffy bear she had seen being taken by Yahya. She darts through the closed portion of the underground, trying to see or hear the fugitive, and finally sees Yahya being held by an arm by the man with a gun pointed at him. Then the Iranian woman jumps her from behind a corner. The women fight violently, with karate punches and kicks, and eventually slip on the wet floor of the narrow corridor, and continue fighting on the floor.

Annie stands free, and the man aims the gun at her. Yahya whacks his arm away as he fires and the two men start fighting, and then tumble off a footbridge.

The Iranian woman is coming back to the fight, and pulls a knife on Annie, but the blonde knocks her out after a second round of karate moves. She runs to Yahya who's hanging from a rail over the side of the foot bridge, many feet above the rushing water below. She fashions a makeshift ""rope"" with a piece of metal chain, and eventually convinces him to grab it. Bracing herself, Annie hauls him to safety.

Later, the National Resettlement Operation Center (NROC) agrees to take on Yahya. Annie tells Yahya that Rutaba didn't betray him, her phones were illegally tapped. Annie gives him an iPod with tunes.

Annie returns to her hotel room to find Danielle is half packed. Annie's about to feel really guilty when Danielle comes out of the closet in a bathrobe with bed head. Danielle tries to hide men's shoes under the bed and Annie seriously wonders what's up until Michael, who had come up to surprise her, pokes his head out of the closet.

Back in town, Liza sits down angrily with Auggie at the bar - telling him Kuyper in maputo is a dead end, and that she almost bought his conflicted conscience routine. Lisa leaves, and Annie joins Auggie for a beer, not noticing his troubled mood for the revelation Liza has brought to him.

Annie looks at Jai across the bar and sees him in his baseball hat, he shapes the rim - just like the mystery man on the beach in Sri Lanka did. Annie realizes Jai is also the guy she saw Ben arguing with in the market there. Annie looks at the note from Ben again and remembers him arguing with Jai on the beach. Now she bagan to understand - and she burns the note."

She tells Annie her third grade daughter Chloe needs a fast replacement field trip and so she wants to bring 30 kids to the Smithsonian - where Annie doesn't actually work - in two days.

She wants to meet Annie's boss. At first Annie cringes, but then she decides it's a good idea - when she's not busy wincing from tooth pain.

JFK Airport: Don Ridley is pulled out of line at the airport over his protests that his medical supplies were cleared in London. Joan (Kari Matchett), Arthur (Peter Gallagher) and Jai (Sendhil Ramamurthy) watch on a surveillance feed as security goes through the ""supplies"" which they think might trace back to Angola. They find rough diamonds.

Don runs. He's finally caught by security.

At Langley, Arthur tells Joan the bosses want to ""read in"" Henry Wilcox (0411857])) on the Angola connection. Joan doesn't like the idea of Arthur's old boss roaming the halls.

She also tells him he can sleep in their bed tonight; she'll be at work.

On the phone, Annie confirms the Smithsonian field trip with Danielle, who urges her again to go to the dentist. Annie had a few bad experiences with military base dentists as a kid and is putting it off.

Jai, Joan and others watch the feed of the FBI with Don the smuggler. He swears he thought it was just medical supplies. He's been back and forth between London and the US 20 times in eight months, all with a pre-screened manifest signed by the US Embassy in London.

Joan likes the idea of replacing Don as the courier.

Jai comes for Annie. Joan wants to send her to London.

Annie is briefed on Don's ""expediter"" Vivian Long (Anna Chlumsky). She helps US businesses abroad. She's involved whether she means to be or not. She applied to the agency, but couldn't pass the physical.

Annie's Smithsonian cover makes her a great fit because they import stuff back and forth all the time. They're going to make her appealing to the smugglers by giving Annie Walker of the Smithsonian a gambling problem. It'll be deep cover, Jai will be there, but with no contact.

London: Annie calls Danielle to tell her she's in London, bringing pre-Colombian artifacts over and the field trip is a go without her.

As Annie is checking in with customs, a highly-caffeinated Vivian finds her. She certainly doesn't seem like a diamond smuggler.

Vivian drives back from the airport, barely getting the wrong-side-of-the-road correct and swerving all over. She offers to show Annie around and knows of a casino they can hit that night.

Jai checks in with the US Embassy. They have surveillance footage of Don meeting with Vivian but before he got the diamonds. They're still not sure how she's involved.

At the British Museum, Annie swaps her art, which Vivian has totally brushed up on. She tells Annie she'll get her papers so she doesn't have to worry about customs.

Annie calls Auggie (Christopher Gorham), telling him she likes Vivian. Meanwhile, Vivian tells someone on the phone that Annie will be going back and forth twice a month, but she likes Annie and wishes it could be someone else.

Auggie tells Annie this'll be their last open call and she's to use her encrypted phone strapped to her thigh for emergencies only. Auggie reminds her to lose at craps, without looking like she's trying.

At Langley, Henry visits Arthur, who reminds him he doesn't like him.

On the FBI interrogation, Don agrees to give up an address for some food for his low blood sugar.

At the embassy, Jai and the embassy CIA guy walk by and Annie plays dumb. Vivian says they're ""spooks"" who work in the basement.

Jai and the dude go to the address Don gave up - it's an ancient looking stone building renovated to a club. Inside, they hear a noise and go upstairs. They find a jeweler's scale. And then a shot rings out. Jai watches as she gets way.

At Langley, Henry joins the Langley viewing of Don's interrogation. He's newly married, to a Brit. They're waiting on a green card for her, which would be Vivian's territory, indicating she might be involved.

Henry reads the transcript quickly and notices Don hasn't mentioned his wife. They look at a photo - of a young cute brunette, Patricia Ridley.

Cut to her, all doled up, waiting for Annie and Vivian at the super fancy casino. Vivian says a quick hello to Jonathan Turnbull, a hot guy at the bar.

Annie declares her plans to turns $10,000 into $20,000. She gives Vivian her purse to hold and she lets Turnbull lift Annie's phone and hotel key.

Outside, Turnbull gives Annie's key to someone and goes through her phone. It rings to Auggie, who answers ""Smithsonian.""

Inside, Annie drinks up and keeps betting. Vivian tries to caution her to slow down, but Annie says gin is a cure for tooth aches.

Back at the hotel, a guy goes through Annie's room.

Losing at the tables, Annie gets a line of credit and keeps drinking. Jai reports on the room search to Auggie. In turn, he tells Jai that the prints from the mystery woman match Don's wife Patricia, who we see walk up to Annie's table.

She's down to her last bet and Vivian tries to talk her out of a risky one. All they need is for her to lose to be a good smuggling target.

But the whole thing goes awry when her bet hits and Annie wins $30,000.

Annie is stunned to see she's ruined her plans. Joan and Auggie wonder how she'll salvage the op. Annie gleefully announces she'll let it ride and plays snake eyes again. A man at the table lets his bet ride with Annie's.

This time, she loses. Observing at the table, Patricia and Turnbull are pleased to see her crap out.

The pit boss tells Annie she won't be allowed to leave the country til she repays her $8,000 loan.

Later, outside, Annie goes through the motions of freaking out. Finally, Vivian says she might have another way, but it's something she probably shouldn't do. She tells Annie about the smuggling, and it's not drugs but she can't meet the people she'd be working for. Annie jumps at the chance, but Vivian tells her it's a really bad idea and to sleep on it.

Annie comes back to the hotel and signals Jai it's a go.

Annie wakes up hungover to a call from Danielle, freaked out on the steps of the Smithsonian because she's there with the 30 kids and no one knows about the tour.

Annie calls Auggie, who then calls Cover Operations and reams them.

Joan briefs Arthur and Henry on Patricia, who's actually Lara Kormen, a former Turkish intelligence operative now a mercenary, maybe working in human trafficking.

They conference with Jai and the embassy dude, who say Vivian has processed dozens of visa applications which trace back to Kormen's people, so she's in deep. Jai wants to flip her, but Henry says they have to get Annie in first.

Annie comes late to her meeting with Vivian and before answering, she asks Vivian why she's working with the smugglers. Vivian talks about being a dork with no life and wanting to impress Turnbull, and now she can't get out.

She tells Annie again not to do it, but Annie won't listen of course. Her meeting is later that day.

In London's Hyde Park. Annie meets with Patricia, who's waiting for her on a bench. She tells Annie the less she knows the better, but Vivian won't be her contact. She tells Annie she'll be paid with a line of credit at the casino.

Patricia takes a call, she slips into Turkish, saying Annie is a strong woman, with a weakness they can exploit.

Annie gets a call from Chloe, who is really enjoying Auggie at the museum. As she's on the phone, she hears Patricia telling someone they need to eliminate Vivian. She tries to look like she's not listening.

Annie calls Vivian and tries to keep her at the office, but she says she's late for a meeting and runs. Annie pulls out her encrypted phone.

At Langley, they take Annie's call in conference. She tells them Vivian is in danger, they recognize the woman Annie describes as Kormen.

Henry says saving Vivian would tip their hand and argues Kormen is setting Annie up to draw her out when she makes a move. Arthur ignores him and tells Jai to have the Marines stop Vivian at the door.

Jai says Vivian has already left, so Joan sends him after her.

Vivian meets with Patricia and a couple goons at the old warehouse.

Despite orders to the contrary, Annie goes to there. She's greeted by a gun to the head.

A goon marches Annie in. Patricia tells Annie she could tell she was listening. Patricia and one goon leave, leaving Turnbull to finish off Annie and Vivian, who's still not clear what's happening.

""I'm one of the basement people,"" Annie explains. ""We got flushed out.""

As Turnbull aims at Vivian, Annie chops his gun arm and punches him. Jai and the embassy guy turn on the old club's music and light system so a disco party breaks out in the dark as Annie and Vivian make a run for it.

Jai shoots at Turnbull and Patricia.

Vivian falls down on a catwalk and freezes so Annie goes back to get her as the goons keep shooting. Annie hustles her outside, where they run smack into Patricia and her gun. Annie steps in front of Vivian and a shot rings out. But it's Jai - he hit Patricia in the back.

Back at Langley, Henry tells Arthur he may have saved a life but he blew an operation. But Arthur and Joan say the director is pleased: the Angola chatter has died down, Komen is dead, Vivian knows more than they thought and they're getting lots of intel from the men Jai captured.

Again, Joan tells Arthur he should sleep in their room and indicates that she'll be there this time.

Vivian enplanes with Annie and Jai. She's relieved to be out from under her own lies. Annie looks like she wishes she could relate.

Annie calls Auggie and asks him to have a dentist waiting."

Meanwhile, in Hong Kong at St. Andrews' School professor Anton Sabine kindly helps a young student with a lesson. After the kid leaves, the professor is alarmed to see two dark-looking men come into his room. He turns and runs.

He only makes it as far as a window with no escape. The men corner him. One tells him Ben Mercer can't save him now.

Elsewhere, a man walks down the middle of a street. We only see his feet. Joan comes seriously for Annie.

The man keeps walking toward a battery of people with guns. It's Ben Mercer. He identifies himself and says, ""I want to come in from the cold.""

Inside Langley, Annie and Joan watch Ben strapped to a polygraph answering basic questions. He says Annie didn't know he was CIA. Ben skips ahead, explaining that two years ago he was in Sri Lanka with his handler Jai Wilcox trying to get in good with an arms dealer. He was going to bring them a chemist, Anton Sabine. Then he met Annie and ""admired her spirit"" and thought better of trading Anton's life for access. The examiner says that's when Ben ""went rogue.""

""I refused to submit an innocent man to a life of making weapons for terrorists,"" he corrects.

He says he brought Anton to Hong Kong and gave him a new life. He says he trusts Annie.

Joan dismisses Annie. In the hall, she stops Jai, but he can't answer her questions about Ben.

Arthur joins Ben, turning off the machines and monitor.

Ben tells him he's there because Anton was abducted and he thinks it was Felix Artigas, an arms dealer, and that he's taken him to Sri Lanka to develop virtually undetectable IEDs. He has a contact, but he needs agency resources.

Later, Jai tells Joan and Arthur the science teacher story checks out.

Arthur decides they'll assume Ben is telling the truth, but they won't trust him. He wants to send Ben with Annie as his handler, because Ben will trust her.

Annie tells Auggie what they're asking. He thinks it's too dangerous, but she wants to go.

Auggie gives her a GPS tracker and an emergency number that rings directly to him.

Arthur returns to his office to find it full of lawyers. Alex, the general counsel, tells him Liza Hearn is about to print an article about something he shows Arthur on a piece of paper. They're crafting strategy.

Ben meets with Annie outside and tells her he doesn't want her to go because it's too dangerous. But she's adamant about going.

At home, Annie packs for her trip. She looks at her puka shell bracelet which matches the one that Ben has. She puts Auggie's teeny tiny GPS sticker tracker inside one of the wshells and puts it on.

Colombo, Sri Lanka They fly separately where she follows him to a square, making sure they're not followed. He leaves a chalk mark for his contact, ""Lonestar.""

Ben joins Annie, explaining Lonestar was a Tamil warlord who buys weapons from Artigas. There's a loud noise and Ben hits the deck, grabbing Annie to protect her. But it's only fireworks for a Hindu festival.

Ben takes Annie to a food stand where he feeds her with his hands.

At Langley, Arthur tells Auggie that Liza is about to publish an article that will ""damage the agency."" He wants Auggie to persuade her to hold the article. He says it'd affect missions on the ground and put operatives in jeopardy.

Joan comes into her office to see the general counsel there. He warns her Arthur might have to resign after the story comes out. He asks her if she'd be willing to take the job -- her husband's job. She'd be the highest-ranking woman in the history of the agency. He reminds her the conversation is classified and not to mention it to Arthur.

Jai drops by his dad Henry's house for advice. Henry (Gregory Itzin) tells him to distance himself from Arthur. Jai asks if Ben was taking orders from anyone else, but his dad says Ben was a great agent who couldn't take orders. He tells Jai to show some initiative.

Annie and Ben check out the mark for his contact and find it marked. They're quickly blindfolded, as Ben expected. Ben tells her Lonestar has always been paranoid.

Blindfolded in the back of a car, Annie says she knows nothing about Ben, but he says there's nothing to know.

They arrive at their destination, a Buddhist temple where Lonestar is hiding out, drinking tea. Ben brings him $50,000 cash and a can of Pringles.

He tells Ben that Artigas has the professor at ""biggest house."" That's all he knows.

Then he starts coughing and clutching is throat. The tea was poisoned. Gunmen arrive and start shooting.

Annie and Ben make a run for it. Ben gives a local cash for his motor bike and they hop on and take off with men with guns in Rovers after them.

They make their way through markets and crowds of people, finally losing one Rover in a food stall. With the other still after them, Ben makes a turn on a cliff tightly and intentionally drops the bike. The Jeep sails past and off the cliff.

Ben drives to safety, which happens to be the hut on the beach where they spent their romantic time together. But he tells her it's the safest place to be until they can get back to town at dawn. Annie's still very bitter.

Liza goes to meet Auggie. He apologizes for lying to her and says he's glad he got to know her. With the charm laid on, he asks her to hold off on the article for 72 hours. She agrees.

At Langley, Joan tells Arthur that Ben and Annie missed their check-in. Arthur's worried about his job. Joan tells him he's done a fantastic job.

At night in their love shack, Ben says tomorrow they can call in to get an ops team to Indonesia where Sabine might be. Ben couldn't sacrifice him back then.

Annie asks if he ever thought about telling her the truth. He tells her he joined the CIA because he felt it was important. But he says she's the most important thing that ever happened to him. He shows her he still has his shell bracelet. She kisses it, then him.

Then, after two years they're back in bed in their beach hut together.

In the morning, Annie wakes up alone again....But only for a minute. Ben comes in from checking the beach and says they have to go. Teams are approaching by sea and Jeeps on the beach. They barely have time to make it anywhere before one vehicle stops them.

Jai gets out of one. He was worried.

Annie remembers Auggie's GPS. Ben figures out that Jai came unsanctioned.

On Jai's orders a team takes the house in Bali where they hope the professor is. But it's empty.

Back in the market in Colombo, Ben and Jai argue over what to do next. Ben wants to travel up river for more intel and Jai wants to go back to Langley. Jai argues it's too dangerous and Ben agrees quickly. He leaves, saying he's going to pull the truck around.

Liza meets up with Auggie so they can swap their stuff back. He thanks her for holding off the article, saying she helped with a number of missions. She's surprised and tells him the article was purely about Arthur. Auggie laughs, realizing Arthur played him. But now he figures Arthur owes him.

Auggie warns Liza to be suspicious of whoever her source is, he doesn't know a spy who's in it solely for the greater good. Liza leaves and Auggie opens the bag she gave him. He finds a toothbrush that isn't his.

Outside, Liza gets into a car with Henry Wilcox. He tells her their next talk will get her the Pulitzer.

Joan walks into Arthur's office, confessing they asked her to consider his job. She doesn't want it, saying their marriage comes first. But he immediately tells her she has to take it.

She says the agency needs them both there and they should fight the ""witch hunt"" together. He's game.

In Sri Lnka, Annie and Jai realize Ben's gone. Jai thinks Ben has his own agenda. Auggie calls, asking what Annie is doing. Her GPS shows her in a bad part of town. She's wearing her bracelet, but realizes she and Ben ""must have switched bracelets after...""

Auggie gives her the location -- 500 feet in the air. They see a nearby half-built sky scraper. Auggie checks into it and finds Artigas is a silent partner. Arthur tells them they have to assume Ben is working his own angle. He gives Jai permission to take down Ben if necessary. Annie is sure Ben's not playing them.

Annie and Jai climb stairs in the skyscraper. They see Ben talking to Artigas, offering to take the professor to Indonesia and taking a wad of cash from the arms dealer. Annie tries to process what she's seeing. Jai puts a silencer on his gun. Ben comes downstairs with the professor and he and Jai end up pointing guns at each other.

Artigas comes down and Annie tells Ben she trusted him. He tells her, again, that the truth is complicated. Then Ben shoots a goon.

Ben takes on one with a piece of rebar. Annie whacks another with something but he grabs her. Jai fights off another, throwing him down an open stairwell.

Ben skewers his opponent on a piece of rebar.

Annie dragged across the floor to the ledge but grabs a nearby spike and jabs it into her goon's leg.

Jai gets the professor and heads for the roof, where their helicopter is supposed to meet them.

Ben grapples with Artigas, but they both roll off the side of the building. They land on a platform in front of Annie. She jumps down below to help Ben fight off Artigas. She whacks him with something and he tumbles over the side.

On the roof, Jai and the professor get in the helicopter with Ben and Annie a few steps behind. But one of the goons survived and follows them up on the roof. He shoots Ben twice in the back. Annie pulls him into the chopper and holds onto him. He's not doing well. The chopper flies away as he holds him. They're both wearing their shell bracelets."

A dog belonging to one of his neighbors has been run over by a car and is wailing on the curb. Francis tells his bodyguard Steve (no surname) to notify the neighbor and, while he is alone, strangles the injured dog to death to put it out of its misery. He returns home and dresses for a party.

New Year's Eve celebration in a hotel ballroom. Speaking to the viewer, Francis introduces newly elected President Garrett Walker (Michael Gill), Vice President-elect Jim Matthews (Dan Ziskie), Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), the presidential Chief of Staff; Francis identifies himself as House Majority Whip, with 22 years in Congress.

Riding back home from the party, Francis's wife, Claire (Robin Wright), tells him that ""this is going to be a big year for us."" Her NGO, Clean Water Initiative, will get a large donation as soon as he is nominated as Secretary of State, Francis tells her.

In the newsroom of The Washington Herald, executive editor Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) and city editor Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) are wondering what the new administration's priorities will be. Cub reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) approaches them and, after Tom leaves, asks Lucas to reassign her from the Fairfax County Council beat to Capitol Hill. He turns down the idea.

Rep. Peter Russo (D-Pa.) (Corey Stoll) arrives in his office and is told by his secretary, Christina Gallagher (Kristen Connolly), that a constituent is waiting for him. The man, builder Henry Chapman (Steven Beckler), presses Russo for action on a zoning bill. Apparently Russo cannot do that, so he distracts Chapman by pretending he is receiving a call from the President-elect. The call is actually coming from Christina.

In the office of the White House chief-of-staff, Francis is told by Linda that the President-elect will NOT appoint him Secretary of State, as promised, and has chosen to keep Francis as Majority Whip. Instead, the president will nominate Senator Michael Kern (D-Colo.), (Kevin Kilner). Francis is offended and disappointed but outwardly accepts the President's decision.

At the offices of Clean Water Initiative, which Claire directs, Claire is telling her office manager, Evelyn Baxter (Maryann Plunkett), that CWI is expanding to an international dimension and will need 6 or 7 more employees.

At The Herald, Zoe offers chief political correspondent Janine Skorsky (Constance Zimmer) to be her researcher on the Hill. Jenine is despective and brushes Zoe off (""I don't have time to be anyone's training wheels"").

Francis returns home at night, to tell Claire that the Secretary of State job is not his. He is quietly furious. So is Claire, who had been counting on a big donation for CWI from the SanCorp corporation, a natural-gas provider, if Francis became the U.S. foreign secretary.

At dawn the following morning, they chat over coffee. She reaffirms her support for him. He is grateful and in an aside says ""I love that woman more than a shark loves blood.""

At Francis' office, his secretary Nancy Kaufberger (Elizabeth Norment) and chief of staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) watch the nomination of Michael Kern as secretary of state. Francis arrives and hints at the future, revealing his anger and frustration. (""We are no longer bound by allegiances. We serve no one. I hold [Walker and Vasquez] accountable."") ""Retribution?"" asks Stamper. ""No, no, it's more than that,"" Francis replies. ""Look at the bigger picture.""

Stamper realizes that Francis is going to go after his enemies' political careers. ""Kern first?"" he asks. ""That's how you devour a whale, Doug, one bite at a time,"" Francis answers. To torpedo Kern, Francis will ""need a buffer, someone we control completely.""

At a church service, the minister tells politicians in the audience to deal positively when faced with defeat. Leaving service, Felicity Holburn (Francie Swift) commiserates with Claire about Francis not getting the Secretary of State job. Felicity's husband, Senator Charles Holburn, (Karl Kenzler), tries to console Francis.

In Russo's bedroom, the Congressman has sex with his secretary, Christina. They've had an affair for six months.

Francis and Claire attend a concert at the D.C. Center for Performing Arts. Francis steps outside and is photographed by a paparazzo oggling a petite concert-goer in a tight white dress.

The woman turns out to be Zoe Barnes, who lives in a dingy walk-up in a less-than-affluent D.C. neighborhood. Upon returning from the concert, she sees the picture of Francis leering at her, sent to her over the Internet by the paparazzo. She Googles Francis' official Congressional website to learn more about him.

On Capitol Hill, Francis is visited by Linda, who brings him two tickets to the presidential ball and tells him that Donald Blythe (Reed Birney), is drafting a new law on education. Blythe is a liberal and Linda asks Francis to review the draft and make it more moderate (""We need a bill that we can pass."") All that within 100 days, she says. ""I can do that,"" Francis assures her.

Later that day, Doug gives Francis a list of possible legislators who could replace Kern as Secretary of State. Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) appeals to Francis and he asks Doug to set up a meeting.

At CWI, Claire tells office manager Evelyn that the SanCorp donation fell through and that Evelyn will have to make a list of employees who can be let go. Evelyn is shocked.

That night, Zoe shows up at Francis' house. She tells him that she needs access to Capitol Hill through him. (""I protect your identity; I print whatever you tell me and I'll never ask any questions. I promise absolute discretion."")

She guesses that education will be the first issue that the new administration will deal with. He does not confirm that guess but tells her that they will meet again.

On a Washington street, a police car stops Russo's car. He is accompanied by a woman other than Christina, an unnamed call girl (Rachel Brosnahan). The policeman arrests him on suspicion of driving while intoxicated.

Stamper learns of the arrest and notifies Francis by phone. Then Stamper approaches the D.C. police commissioner, Barney Hull (Chuck Cooper), and asks him to release Russo, no questions asked, no paperwork filed. Stamper offers Hull endorsement from Underwood and fund-raising for a run as Mayor of D.C. Russo is released.

Over breakfast, Claire aks Francis for two tickets for the Holburns to the presidential ball. She explains that she needs a donation from them for CWI now that the SanCorp donation fell through.

On Capitol Hill, Francis ostensibly shreds Blythe's education bill telling him that it's too liberal. He asks Blythe for a rewrite.

Meeting later with Catherine Durant, Francis hints that he will torpedo Michael Kern's nomination for Secretary of State if she's interested in the job. She appears to be receptive.

Francis summons Zoe to an art museum, where he gives her Blythe's draft bill. She takes it home, studies it and writes an in-depth article about it.

Francis invites Russo to his office and tells him that he rescued him from jail. For doing that, Francis asks Russo for his ""absolute, unquestioning loyalty."" ""Anything. Name it, Frank,"" Russo replies.

Zoe delivers to city editor Lucas her story about the Blythe bill and photocopies of the half-shredded bill. Executive editor Hammershmidt approves its publication and orders Janine to assist Zoe with further research. Janine, who is clearly Zoe's senior but now is in a subservient position, is insulted but complies.

President Walker is inaugurated. In his address, he stresses his education reform bill. At the inauguration ball, Francis dances with Cathy Durant.

The following morning, Francis goes to Freddy's Barbecue Joint for breakfast. He opens a copy of The Herald, which carries Zoe's story on Page One, blasting Blythe's educational bill as ""far left of center"" and tying a ""massive funding package to liberal mandates.""

A kitchen faucet drips. Frank (Kevin Spacey) breaks it with a hammer blow, then stalks away angrily, obviously in a bad mood.

Later, at his office, Frank meets with Remy Danton (Mahershala Ali), a lobbyist for SanCorp, the natural-gas producers. Frank tells Remy that President Garrett Walker (Michael Gill) is considering multimillionaire Raymond Tusk (Gerald McRaney), a nuclear-energy proponent and the owner of many nuclear power plants, as his new Vice President.

""You and I cannot let that happen,"" Frank says. ""SanCorp does not want a pro-nuclear-energy man in the White House. SanCorp needs to initiate a hostile takeover"" of some of Tusk's subsidiaries, Frank proposes, companies that refine and ship the uranium Tusk's plants need. Remy sounds doubtful but promises to ""make some calls.""

In her office at CWI, Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) is talking to her lawyer, Oliver Spence (Michael Warner), who tells her that her former associate, Gillian Cole (Sandrine Holt) is suing Claire, claiming that Claire fired her because she was pregnant. Claire denies the accusation. The lawyer recommends offering Gillian a settlement.

Slugline reporter Janine Skorsky (Constance Zimmer) tells fellow reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) that, to investigate the death of Congressman Peter Russo (Corey Stoll) they need the arrest record from January, when he was detained for driving while intoxicated. ""We need to know who got him off,"" she says. ""If Underwood was involved, we're talking abuse of power and corruption."" Zoe counters that ""there are no files, no arrest records, nothing."" Zoe proposes enlisting Herald city editor Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) to do some research.

In bed that night, Zoe asks Lucas for help in her investigation but he is not receptive.

In the Oval Room the following morning, President Walker asks Frank about his visit in St. Louis with Raymond Tusk. Frank says he wasn't able to convince Tusk to accept Walker's offer of the Vice Presidency but suggests that Walker invite him to the White House and do it personally. Walker's chief of staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), sides with Frank. Walker agrees to a meeting that Friday.

Lucas arrives at Zoe's apartment looking agitated and secretive. Closes all windows, turns off all lights, takes Zoe into a hallway and says that a cover-up of Russo's arrest and release goes all the way up to the Police Commissioner. Through a contact in the Police Department, Lucas has obtained mugshots of Russo's companion at the time of the arrest, a prostitute named Rachel Posner (Rachel Bresnahan). He gives Zoe the pictures and a copy of the woman's previous arrest record. If Zoe investigates further, her life may be in danger, he says. She insists that she'll go on.

Remy phones Frank to say that Scott Cunningham (Armand Schultz), CEO of SanCorp, cannot immediately engage in a corporate takeover of Tusk. Frank asks for a meeting with Cunningham. Remy refuses the request. Frank decides to fly to Atlanta anyway and meet with Cunningham.

Janine, Zoe and Lucas go over Rachel Posner's record. Janine recommends going to Lynchburg, Va., the woman's hometown, to gather more information. Zoe notices that the woman's previous arrest record placed her at the District Grand Hotel.

In Atlanta, Scott Cunningham gets into Frank's car against his better judgment. Cunningham claims that Remy did not speak to him about Tusk and refuses to talk any further with Frank. Frank suspects double-dealing on Remy's part.

Doing research at the District Grand Hotel bar, Lucas notices a call girl (Kellyn Lindsay) picking up a hotel guest. He decides she might be a good source for information about Rachel Posner.

At home, Claire describes her nightmares to Frank. She talks of seeing ""the kids"" and seeing ""the girl"" being taken away from her by a clinging vine. Apparently, that's how she visualizes the three children she conceived but aborted.

Later at night, working out in the basement, Frank falls on his back when the rowing machine string breaks. Remy phones him and says he's on his way to Frank's home for a conversation. When Remy arrives, Frank berates him for not telling Cunningham that SanCorp should attack Tusk's holdings. Remy says that he'll deal with Cunningham ""my way.""

Claire's lawyer tells her that Gillian doesn't want a settlement and wishes to go to court.

In Lynchburg, Va., Zoe meets with one of Rachel's guidance counselors (Carlyncia Peck), who says that Rachel dropped out of school and ran away. The counselor intimates that Rachel was abused by her father.

In Frank's office, Linda tells Frank and Doug that Tusk and the President will meet the following day. Frank asks her to set a meeting between House Speaker Bob Birch (Larry Pine) and the President. She's puzzled but agrees.

Leaving the school, Zoe phones Janine to tell her she's ""got something for you."" The ""something"" is an off-the-record schedule for the President, which shows that Walker will meet with Birch on Thursday and Tusk on Friday. That apparently means that the President is going to offer the Vice Presidency to one of them. Janine publishes the item.

The press, alerted by Janine's blog, pounces on both Birch and Tusk. As coached by Frank, Linda tells the President that the leak was the result of a clerical mistake and that the clerk has been fired.

Frank goes into a church and berates God for not aiding his plans.

Claire confronts Gillian at the latter's home. Claire tries to mend fences but Gillian refuses.

Back at home, Claire tells Frank that everything they're doing will go for naught if they have no children to leave it to. Clearly, she has been affected by the fact that Gillian is expecting a child.

At the District Grand Hotel bar, Lucas shows the local call girl a picture of Rachel. The girl says Rachel quit ""the business"" and is serving tables at a restaurant in Georgetown.

Claire visits an ob-gyn, Dr. Larson (Theresa McCarthy), to inquire about the chances of having a baby after three abortions. Dr. Larson is doubtful.

At the office, Doug warns Frank that Tusk is making a play for SanCorp stock. To Frank, that means that Remy is now serving Tusk, not SanCorp, and has tipped Tusk of Frank's plan. Everything is now backfiring.

At the restaurant in Georgetown, Zoe steals an employee roster that contains Rachel's telephone number. She calls Rachel to make an appointment. The two meet that night at the entrance to a federal building. Zoe says that she knows that Rachel was with Russo when he was arrested for DUI.

Rachel walks away and into Stamper's car. Lucas sees the car drive away and takes down the license number.

Frank gets a call from his barbecued-ribs provider, Freddy (Reg Cathey). When he arrives at Freddy's, he finds Remy and Tusk inside. Remy confirms that he has defected to Tusk (""SanCorp is a big fish but Tusk is a whale."")

Inside Freddy's, Tusk tells Frank that he has bought 3 percent of SanCorp's stock and within the week he will own 10 percent. Tusk wants to stay in good commercial relations with China and needs Frank to help him in Congress. Frank refuses to be an ""indentured servant"" to Tusk; he wants an equal partnership.

In Zoe's apartment, Janine, Zoe and Lucas try to figure out what really happened to the late Peter Russo. Janine says that Frank wanted Russo to win the Governorship of Pennsylvania, but Zoe realizes that the opposite is probably true: ""Maybe he wanted Russo to self-destruct."" Her trust in Frank wavers.

Arriving in the Oval Office, Frank is greeted by Walker and Tusk. Walker confesses that he sent Frank to St. Louis so Tusk could vet him. Walker offers Frank the Vice Presidency. Frank accepts.

Frank returns home, tells driver Ed Meechum (Nathan Darrow) that he'll need him to continue to be his bodyguard. Meechum accepts. Inside, Claire congratulates her husband on the appointment.

In a cafeteria, Stamper asks Christina Gallagher (Kristen Connolly), Russo's former aide and mistress, if Zoe Barnes has harassed her. She says that Zoe knew something about the President's withdrawal of the nomination of Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) as Secretary of State (SEE CHAPTER ONE.) Doug seems concerned.

Claire and Frank leave the house at night for a jog through the neighborhood. Inside their home, Frank's telephone rings. It's a call from Doug. (END CHAPTER)"

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0547051/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,Clair is upset when Theo brings home a bad report card and claims he has no plans to attend college; Cliff is horrified to meet Denise's date.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jay Sandrich'],"['', '', '']",[],"['doctor', 'family relationships', 'father']",[],"The Huxtable family has gathered around the breakfast table before the kids have to go to school and the parents have to go to work. Clair, the mother, is making eggs and serving cereal while the children dance around the kitchen and the table as the radio plays jazzy music. When the family's only boy, Theo, says that he wanted his eggs scrambled, his mother obliges by scrambling the sunny side-up eggs right on Theo's plate. The second-youngest child, Vanessa, asks her mother if they could get a dog (a recurring request of Vanessa's throughout the series' run), to which her brother replies ""We already HAVE a dog; YOU!"". Vanessa counters by mentioning that Theo's report card, which he will get that day, will likely have grades with the first letter of the word ""dog"". Clair tells Theo that she hopes his report card this term will be better than last term. Clair's husband, Cliff, comes downstairs to the kitchen and serves himself oatmeal in a silly manner before he leaves for work.

In a hospital delivery room, Cliff follows a would-be father out to the waiting room. The man has been scared off by his wife's attitude in during what appears to be a painful delivery -- the man says his wife had yelled at him to leave the room. Cliff comforts the father and tells him to buck up and to cheer for his wife as she goes through the birth. Cliff's words are very inspirational and the father enthusiastically returns to his wife's side.

That evening, while the family, minus Cliff, eat dinner, the children have the usual spate of arguments, bickering and minor physical altercations, especially when Theo won't stop teasing his youngest sister, Rudy. Clair reminds Theo that he's already in very hot water for bringing home a report card with D grades in every class. Clair orders Theo to his room to await his father's return from work and also orders Vanessa and Rudy to go upstairs and get ready for bed. As they all walk upstairs, Clair has to yell at them again to stop fighting.

Cliff arrives home, cheerful that the birth he was performing was a success. Clair immediately asks him in a cross tone why they had to have four children (a small error in the series, since it's revealed later that Clair and Cliff actually have five children). Clair hands Cliff Theo's report card and tells him to go upstairs and talk to their son about becoming a better student. When Cliff suggests he get something to eat first, Clair glares a bit and he tells her he'll ""be meaner on an empty stomach.""

Cliff enters Theo's room, which is a complete mess of strewn-about clothes and personal objects and talks to his son. Theo's attitude is one of indifference; Theo feels he doesn't need to do better in school or go to college. He tells Cliff he wants to get a job like ""regular people"", say driving a bus or working in a gas station. Cliff then demonstrates what life would be like for a person who earns the lower wages of a ""regular person"" using the money from Theo's nearby Monopoly set. Theo expects that he'll earn $250 per week; Cliff says he'll give him $300/week, $1200 per month. Theo is excited, until Cliff subtracts $350 for taxes, saying ""the government comes for the regular people FIRST."" Cliff tells Theo he'll have to find an apartment (emphasizing that he cannot live in his parents' home) and that one in Manhattan will cost $400/month in rent. Theo counters, saying he can live in New Jersey for $200. Cliff takes another $200 for a car; Theo takes back $100 saying he'll get a motorcycle. Cliff takes an additional $50 for a helmet. Cliff subtracts a further $100 for clothing, Theo gives him another $100 saying he wants to ""look good!"" Cliff takes $100 a month for food; Theo takes it back claiming he can ""get by on bologna and cereal"". When Theo cheerfully says he has everything he needs and $200 extra for the month, Cliff asks him if he plans to have a girlfriend and when Theo cheerfully says ""For sure!"", heartlessly takes Theo's last $200.

Cliff hears an argument out in the hall and finds Rudy and Vanessa have been kicked out of the bathroom by their older sister Denise, who needs to get ready for a date. Vanessa describes a desperate situation where shampoo from the shower has run into Rudy's eyes & may blind her. Cliff catches Denise as she comes out of the bathroom and objects to Denise's going out on a date and the outfit she's wearing. Denise tells Cliff that she'd gotten permission from her mother. Denise retreats to change her outfit and Cliff goes downstairs to talk to Clair.

When he asks Clair ""how ugly"" Denise's date is, the young man hears him and Cliff invites him to talk while they sit on the family couch. The young man has a fairly haughty attitude. Cliff notices that he has one ear pierced, a tradition the young man partook of when he was a merchant Marine & crossed the equator. When Cliff asks the guy if he's shipping out any time soon, the guy tells him that he's out of the merchant Marines and back in school -- TWO years behind Denise. He also tells Cliff that after being in a Turkish prison, ""everything else is easy."" Cliff is flustered a

In the kitchen, Cliff fills Clair in on his conversation with their son. When Cliff tells her that Theo's responded with a mere ""I'll try"" to Cliff economics lesson and his lecture about doing better in school, Clair isn't satisfied and tells Cliff to talk to Theo again.

Back upstairs, Cliff approves of Denise's new ensemble but questions her about her makeup and her date's personal history. Humored, Denise kisses him and goes off to meet her date. Cliff then remembers he has to finish his talk with Theo. His son gives a heartfelt response to Cliff's earlier lecture, saying that if his father wasn't a doctor & earned less, he would still love them. Theo believes that Cliff should accept Theo's belief that he was meant not to excel in school or go to college and that he can live like a regular person. Cliff considers this for a moment and then tells Theo, in a raised and angry voice that Theo's impassioned reply is ""the *dumbest thing [he's] ever heard in [his] life!"" He tells Theo unequivocally that he will try harder in school and will be successful. Cliff also tells him in a softer tone that he loves him very much and wants him to do the best he can. Theo agrees.

Down in the kitchen, Cliff gets something to eat and fills Clair in on what he told Theo. Clair is critical at first but then realizes that Cliff had properly lectured Theo on success in life starting in school.

Later that evening when Cliff and Clair get ready for bed, Cliff begins to get amorous with Clair, who reminds him that ""this is how we got the children in the first place."" Cliff still does but there's a knock at the door; it's Vanessa and Rudy. Following a brief lesson on proper etiquette for entering a room, Vanessa tells her parents that Rudy can't sleep because the Wolf-man is in their closet. Clair invites them to sleep with their parents that night and all four crowd into the bed. When Cliff turns out the light and says ""Goodnight, dear"" all three comically tell him the same."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0771683/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,Cliff forces the entire family to hold a funeral for Rudy's dead goldfish Lamont.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jay Sandrich'],"['', '', '']",[],"['doctor', 'family relationships', 'father']",[],"Cliff comes home from a long day at the hospital. He lies comfortably down on the living room couch for a nap but is soon wakened by Vanessa. She tells him there may be an emergency with her younger sister Rudy but is unable to convey just how serious the situation is. She tells her father that Rudy's goldfish, Lamont, is dead. At first Cliff merely says ""I'm sorry"" but Vanessa convinces him to go upstairs with her and talk to Rudy, whom doesn't understand that her fish is dead.

When they arrive, Rudy is blissfully sprinkling food into Lamont's bowl. Cliff investigates, first shaking the bowl slightly, poking the body with his finger and then flipping it in is hand. He sits down with Rudy and, with some ""help"" from Vanessa, tells her that Lamont is dead. Theo has also joined the conversation but is mildly admonished by his father when he insensitively confirms the news. Cliff tries to soften the blow for Rudy by suggesting she remember how much fun Lamont was. After Rudy and Theo go downstairs for dinner, Vanessa suggests that Cliff make her a special dinner to cheer her up.

At dinner, Rudy, now feeling the loss of her pet, doesn't want to eat. Claire tries to tell Rudy about the loophole she was able to crack in a legal case at her law firm but Rudy doesn't want to hear about it. Claire takes Rudy out of the kitchen to console her. Cliff seems slightly appalled at the lack of empathy from Theo, Denise & Vanessa. Denise tells him that it's just a dead fish and Theo jokingly says they should have a funeral. Cliff hits on the idea and takes things a few steps further, picking up the phone when Theo suggests they have their local reverend deliver a eulogy. The kids try to stop him and Cliff blackmails them all into attending the funeral on Saturday morning. He also coerces them into wearing black and doing whatever he orders. With the reverend still on the phone, Cliff covers up by asking if Christmas will still be at the same time that year. After he hangs up, he sticks his tongue out at his kids.

Later, in their bedroom, Cliff picks out one of Claire's dresses, a fancy dark blue one that's the closest she has to a black one. Having been rebuffed by most of the family about her great day at work, she refuses to tell Cliff about it at first but finally does when Cliff promises to give her his undivided attention. She begins to tell him but his pager goes off. He shuts off the alarm a couple of times but when a long beep is heard, he finally calls. One of his patients is on her way to the hospital. He then listens to Claire's story, which turns out to be rather pathetic.

On Saturday morning, Cliff calls everyone to the family bathroom, where the funeral will be held. The kids assemble: Claire is wearing her fancy dress, Vanessa wears a black leotard, Denise is in frumpy clothes she dressed in to meet up with friends, Theo is in a sharp blazer and Rudy is wearing a little sailor's dress, Lamont's favorite since it is nautically-themed. Theo brings Cliff the fish on his little net and they all gather around the toilet. Cliff begins to eulogize about Lamont with Vanessa kicking in a few unintentionally silly remarks. Rudy suddenly says she wants to watch television. Denise hears a car horn and leaves, saying her ride has arrived. Cliff is again appalled at the lack of sensitivity and starts yelling. Barely able to keep from laughing, Claire tries to calm him down, saying that the spectacle he's created is mostly ridiculous. She also reminds him that he never went to the hospital to check on his patient. When he goes to check his watch, the net holding Lamont tips and he falls into the toilet bowl. Cliff flushes the toilet. Moments later, Rudy reappears. Cliff asks if she wants to mourn a bit and she bashfully tells him she needs to use the bathroom. Smiling widely, she closes the door after her parents leave."

Theo has gotten something of a boost from the experience, having done the shopping in the store by himself and using his father's charge account while Claire waited outside. Theo is also excited about the shirt he bought; it's from a popular new designer named Gordon Gartrelle. Theo shows his father the shirt and points out some of it's finer features like the silk it's made from, the collar, hidden buttons and its front pocket. When Cliff asks how much the shirt cost, Theo evades the question with further admiration for the shirt. Cliff looks at the sales receipt and sees that it cost a steep $95. Cliff tells Theo he's going to return the shirt, prompting protest from his son. Cliff gives Theo a generous $30 for a different shirt but Theo is disappointed.

Up in his bedroom, Denise joins him and Theo tells her what happened. She reminds him that a $95 price tag is more for the brand than the actual value of the shirt and that the profit goes to paying for the designer's extravagant lifestyle. Theo tells her their father gave him $30 to buy a different shirt and Denise offers to make him a replica of the Gartrelle shirt for him. Thrilled, Theo gives her the money.

Denise finds that making a shirt is very difficult. When she asks her parents for more money to finish it, they give it to her. Cliff and Claire both realize that the situation will end in disaster because they know Denise's tailoring skills aren't up to the job. Meanwhile, Cliff is fighting off a severe cold that he tries to hide from Claire.

On the day she promised to give Theo the shirt, he explodes, complaining about how badly it's turned out: it's too big, the sleeves are uneven and of two different designs, the collar is crooked and it looks like it was assembled from a patchwork of fabric. Furious, Theo goes to his father in the kitchen and shows him the shirt. His father tries to stifle his laughter but tells Theo he's learned his lesson about expecting more than someone could promise him. Theo begs his father for the chance to go back to the store and get a new Gartrelle but his father, amidst Theo's panicky state, tells him he can find the original Gartrelle he'd bought in his father's room. When Theo asks him about it, Cliff laughingly tells him he never took the first one back knowing that something like this would happen.

Theo goes out the kitchen door to the living room and finds that his friends and his date have arrived. When they see in Denise's shirt they seem a bit shocked and Theo is very embarrassed. Cliff walks in and tries to cover for Theo, saying it's his shirt and that Theo can't wear it. Theo steps up and tells his date that it's his. His date is unexpectedly excited; to her it looks like another new, hot designer, Idgy Amorata. Theo is thrilled and confident, saying he'll go out anyway. When Claire tells him to put on a coat, Theo scoffs at the idea of covering up his new, stylish shirt. Claire then turns her attention to Cliff, who still refuses to admit he's sick."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0547014/?ref_=ttep_ep14,,Theo gets an earring without permission.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jay Sandrich'],"['', '', '']",[],"['doctor', 'family relationships', 'father']",[],"Theo returns home from a weekend stay at his friend Cockroach's house. He sneaks into the house and quickly runs up to his room. Asking Denise to join him, he shows her that he's gotten his left ear pierced, saying that he had Cockroach's sister Tilly do it in their garage. Theo boasts a bit about how he's a man now and free to make his own decisions. Denise is at first giddy about the piercing but notices that it may be infected; when she tries to touch the earring, Theo recoils in pain. Theo makes her promise not to tell their parents, wanting to reveal it to them later.

Worried about her brother, Denise talks to Cliff and Claire and drops hints about everyone's earlobes. Cliff goes up to Theo's room to investigate and finds Theo listening to his headphones. However, when he unplugs the headset, Theo at first is reluctant to take them off and only does when Cliff orders him to. Theo sits with his left ear facing away from his father. When his father tries to look at his ear, Theo cleverly maneuvers himself to avoid any notice but soon can't hide it from his father any longer. Cliff looks him over and determines that Theo's outer ear is infected. He says he'll treat his son's ear; when Theo asks if he can expect a punishment, Cliff eagerly says yes.

Down in Cliff's office, Cliff disinfects the wound and sits down with Theo to have a talk. When asked, Theo tells his father that he had the piercing done as a sign of independence. Cliff isn't fooled and asks what girl Theo is trying to impress. Cliff suddenly shifts gears and tells Theo he won't punish him but will subject him to a morality lecture from his grandfather, Russell, who's due to arrive for dinner in a few minutes. Theo is frightened but thinks that his grandfather won't notice. Cliff insures that he will by putting a large bandage over the wound.

When the grandparents arrive, Theo tries to give them a short greeting and sneak away. Before he can, his youngest sister Rudy notices the bandage, calling his grandfather's attention. Cliff eagerly tells his father what happened and leaves Theo to Russell's devices. Russell surprises his son and grandson by stating that he has no intention of lecturing Theo, especially since Cliff once tried a crazy idea when he was about his son's age to impress a girl. Russell tells Theo the story of how Cliff tried to straighten his hair by mixing up a tonic that used nitroglycerin to relax the curl. The solution burned Cliff's hair and scalp and left him temporarily bald. When Theo asks his father who he was trying to impress, Cliff tells him it was Claire. Overjoyed, Theo runs for the kitchen to share the story but Cliff stops him short. Theo agrees not to reveal Cliff's secret but then asks his grandfather to tell the story. Russell jogs Claire's memory, prompting her to tell everyone. Russell then tells Claire that Theo had his ear pierced but then bids Claire not to come down hard on Theo because he'd already talked to him and had taken the same tone with Cliff when he was younger and acted just like his son.

Everyone gets a good laugh over the conversation but Cliff's mother Anna chimes in saying that Russell was not so understanding or patient in dealing with Cliff. She mentions a tattoo that Russell had gotten when he was a teenager. Russell had wanted to get Anna's name tattooed on his chest to impress her but when he went to the tattoo parlor he had a severe cold and mispronounced Anna's name, saying ""Adda"", the name of another girl from their neighborhood who was also attracted to Russell. When the tattoo came back misspelled, Russell had it removed, leaving a large scar on his chest. Cliff suddenly remembers how his father told him he'd gotten the scar during combat in World War II, a story Russell had made up to avoid embarrassment. The ladies leave the men behind in the living room, Denise telling them they're all crazy. After they leave, Cliff gives them all nicknames: Skinhead for himself, Scar Chest for his father and Hole-in-the-Lobe for Theo."

But this episode is very dear to me because it taught that you always need to reach for your dreams and goals. Do not let anything hold you back. Your happiness is too important for that. Believe in others, and most importantly, believe in yourself. There will always be obstacles in your ways, but if you want that goal, you have to get through those obstacles. As the speech in the end concludes, ""This is my American family, and I hope that nothing gets in the way of their dreams."""

She always said that when people believe you, you will always have your integrity to fall back on. The issue of this episode is does Theo smoke marijuana. I love what his dad said, ""You done many things, some good, some bad. But one thing you are not is a liar. So if you say it isn't yours then we believe you.""

Diana reminds her she just has to have another member of the circle present. She tells her to be thankful things are under control and hope Sally doesn't remember she almost killed her.

Diana asks Cassie if she wants to hang out later, but Cassie doesn't think they should be friends. She doesn't like lying to Sally about what happened.

Melissa and Nick finish up some midday bonking. She asks him if he wants to go to the dance, she doesn't care if Faye knows. He tells her they're just about sex and if she wants more, it's over.

In school, Cassie asks Sally what happened to her arm. Sally says it's a blur, but she keeps getting flashes of Faye, like she did it. Sally remembers Faye giving her her ""bitch stare"" and then waking up on the rocks.

A cute guy named Luke asks Adam about Cassie.

Charles reports to Dawn that Henry's body is in the lake house and won't be found. Charles says he brought it on himself. Henry was Faye's grandfather.

Dawn says they have to move fast before people find out what they're up to. Diana sees her dad leaving Dawn's office and finds it weird.

Adam introduces Cassie to Luke and he asks her to the dance. She says she has to help Sally decorate and asks for a rain check.

Sally and Cassie review dance plans at the boathouse. Sally notices her staring at Adam, who works there.

Adam asks Cassie if she's going to the dance with Luke. She's not, but says maybe. Then she finds Luke and takes him up on his offer.

Outside, a man named Zachary approaches her. He says she looks like her mother. He didn't know she died. He asks if she's going to live there and seems concerned when she says she is. He tells her her mother vowed never to come back and then accuses her of being a witch like her mom. He grabs her when she tries to walk away. Diana comes out and uses magic to shove him aside. ""I'm not going to let this happen again,"" he says.

Diana and Cassie go to the house and find Faye. Adam and Melissa join them and they tell her about Zachary. Cassie tells them Sally might be onto them, too.

Melissa and Faye are irked to have lost their individual powers. Diana assures them they can work together.

Diana's dad wakes her up to ask about Zachary. He asks what he was saying. Charles says he went to school with him and urges her to stay away from him. She asks what's going on with him and Mrs. Chamberlain. He says they're dating (even though they're not, just evil plotting). She's all for it.

Cassie goes through her mom's old things and finds a yearbook, with photos of Amelia Blake and Zachary Larsen and a woman named Heather.

Cassie and Diana look at the yearbook. They wonder if he meant the fire. Diana thinks it was witchcraft and they covered it up, but none of their parents will talk about it. Diana wants to find out what he meant.

Melissa and Faye concentrate on trying to move a phone together. It works. Faye can't believe Melissa wants to go to the school dance. She pointedly says, for Nick's benefit, that she likes dancing.

Dawn meets up with Charles. He tells her Zachary approached Cassie. Dawn mentions that Zachary was friends with Amelia. He wants the crystal to go talk to Zachary, but she suggests they can't kill everyone who asks questions. He briefs her on their dating cover story.

In the abandoned house, Faye looks for an old spell to practice with. She tries to light a candle using magic, but can't. She turns around to see Zachary Larsen watching her.

He says the six of them are witches, saying he knows their families. He asks if they've bound their circle and taunts her to stop him. He sees she has no power and the circle is bound. She runs off.

Cassie meets up with Luke at the dance, but can't stop looking at Adam. Melissa is happy to see Nick when he arrives, even though he's cool to her.

Diana talks to Mrs. Chamberlain, letting her know she's happy she and her dad are dating. Mrs. Chamberlain goes along with it.

Luke goes to get punch and Adam talks to Cassie. He tells her she looks nice, but she tells him no compliments. Sally tells them to start dancing so other people will. Faye comes to the school.

Nick rolls a joint in the hall and Melissa tries to get him to dance, but he's rude to her. Finally, he asks her why she likes him, since he just treats her like dirt. She's about to walk off when Faye finds her and tells her about Zachary.

Adam and Cassie dance and he tells her they have to make things work. Diana interrupts them with news about Zachary. Faye suggests they look him up in school records, she has her mom's master key.

Luke finds them and Cassie makes up a story about them working on dance committee stuff.

Charles finds Zachary on his boat. Zachary immediately tells him his daughter is a witch and he knows what he is. ""Now that Cassie Blake is back it's happening all over again,"" he says.

Charles denies anything is going on. Zachary think Charles knows they're practicing but isn't stopping them because he's up to something. Zachary says he has no choice. He whacks him with a crow bar and beats him into submission. He grabs a knife, saying all he has to do is kill one of them.

Adam and Diana log on to Faye's mom's school computer and look up Zachary Larsen. He was suspended for fighting. He skipped school with his girlfriend Heather Barnes. Diana recognizes the name.

In the hall, Melissa tells Faye she thinks Nick hates her. Faye says he hates himself and has issues since he lost both parents.

Adam sees that Heather and Amelia were on a million activities together. They check the story about the fire that killed their parents and see that Heather Barnes was among the victims. They think Zachary blames what happened to Heather on their parents, but he's taking it out on them.

Luke asks Cassie to dance, but she says no. He says never mind, since he can tell she's distracted and not into him.

Faye finds Nick and chews him out for treating Melissa poorly.

In the hall alone, Cassie runs into Zachary. She runs.

Charles finds Dawn and warns her Zachary is coming for the kids.

Adam, Diana and Nick go looking for Cassie. Everyone stalks the halls.

Cassie hides and sees Zachary walk by, so she steps out. But he's right in front of her. He grabs her. The others see her. They're all together and decide to see what their full power is.

Zachary holds Cassie down with a knife when they walk up on him. He says Heather didn't die, ""what Amelia did to her was far worse.""

The boys arrive and help lift him into the ceiling then drop him to the floor, knocking him out. OK, now what? Faye wonders.

Dawn walks around the corner and they quickly compile a lie, that they found lockers open and papers everywhere and the man was already there. They say he slipped and fell. Dawn says he's an addict and has been breaking in and vandalizing the place for years. She tells them she'll deal with it.

She calls Charles.

Later, outside, Faye reports that her mom had Zachary arrested and asked them to keep it quiet so it doesn't reflect badly on the school. Cassie thanks them for saving her life.

Cassie wants to know what her mom did to Heather, but Diana assures her that can wait till another day.

Melissa leaves, with Nick following. He invites her over, but he says he just wants to hang out and watch a movie. She says okay.

At Cassie's house, Diana tells her she thinks they're better together than they are apart. She tells Cassie she sees the way Adam looks at her. Cassie assures her it's nothing. Diana says she hopes Cassie is right because she's loved Adam for as long as she can remember. She tells Cassie she wants them to be friends.

Charles and Dawn pull over with Zachary in the trunk, bound and gagged. They put the crystal in his pocket and Dawn cuts her hand and recites a spell. She tells him he's marked and she can find him anywhere he goes. If he ever hurts any of their children, she will turn his life into a living hell worse than Heather ever knew."

Cassie thinks they still need him for the circle. Diana thinks he made his choice when he left with the witch hunters.

Diana suggests a distraction. She has a dress picked out for the Fire/Ice dance, but she's only allowed to wear white or red and it's spotted. She suggests they use their magic to change the color. They try a spell together. Instead, the dress bursts into flames. Cassie realizes she did it.

Adam's dad tells him he volunteered to chaperone the dance. He says it's been a few weeks since he last had a drink. Adam admits he feels a connection with Cassie.

At school, Melissa offers to help with the dance. Diana's bummed to learn her cousin Holden went back to school. Cassie gets distracted when she thinks she sees Jake walking by. She follows the kid, but it's someone else.

In school, Cassie tells Adam she wants to learn more about her father. Adam suggests the city records and offers to go with her. Diana watches them walk away together.

Outside, Faye sees her voodoo guy Lee waiting for her. He IDs the other members of the circle and says he thinks she lost her powers when they bound the circle. He offers to help. She tells him to get lost.

At the city records, the woman tells Cassie she needs a birth certificate to look up her father. Adam makes up another issue and the woman goes to research. Cassie gets on the computer, but comes up with nothing. She checks tax records and finds a deed under his name. Adam recognizes the address and takes her to it.

It's a sign covered up in the front yard of the abandoned house. They originally found it from a map in Diana's book of shadows that showed it as a confluence of energy, where magic is at its strongest. Adam shows her the stuff they put in the basement when they found it.

Adam suggests he pick her up for the dance, but Cassie doesn't want to hurt Diana. She doesn't want to think about the idea that maybe they're meant to be together. ""It's funny, because these days I can't think about anything else,"" he says.

Faye tells Melissa about Lee's claims.

Cassie is leaving the basement when she hears a noise. She turns on a light and sees a symbol burned into the ceiling.

Melissa and Diana get ready for the dance. They remember when they were friends as kids. Then Faye happened, then Adam. Cassie runs in and updates them on her dad and the abandoned house. She finds the same symbol in her mom's family book, but notices a page is missing. She knows it wasn't missing before. Faye had it last. They look at Melissa for answers.

Faye goes to Lee's voodoo garage. He says the spell she gave him is designed to extract dark magic. He says he can take the magic and put it into her. He asks who has the dark magic and she tells him it's Cassie. He warns her dark magic can turn on you. He says they need something of Cassie's and she has to be nearby. She tells him he's not getting laid, but he assures her when they have sex it won't be because of a deal. He just wants a future favor in return.

Cassie calls to confront Faye about the missing page. She tells Faye she's sick of her jealousy and she should stop being pathetic and just give back the page. Faye tells her to meet her at the dance.

At the dance Cassie and Adam make goo-goo eyes across the room. Cassie follows Adam's dad into the hallway and asks about her dad. She asks if her dad had anything to do with the fire that everyone died in. She asks what if she's just like him. He says he didn't start the fire and tells her she's defined by her own actions, not her parents. She's resolved to find out about him, even when he says it's not what her mom would want.

Diana stares at Adam at the dance. Melissa sympathizes about the difficulty of moving on and urges her to ask someone to dance. She picks a cute guy she's never talked to before.

Faye and Lee snoop through Cassie's house and pick a locket out of her bedroom. Faye thinks she sees someone in the house across the way.

Adam watches Diana dance.

Lee puts Diana in two triangles to draw Cassie's power. He unzips her dress, because apparently that's part of it. Cassie tells Adam about the symbol and Faye stealing the page. She shows him and he recognizes it as a symbol used for channeling dark magic.

Lee draws an animal tooth down Faye's spine and draws a little blood, then rubs something in it. He dabs at the blood and pockets the Kleenex.

Adam finds Diana in the hall and complements her on the dance. He tells her he's glad she's having fun, and he gets that it's not their time. He says other people are having a hard time adjusting to their break up, like Cassie, who wouldn't even accept a ride to the dance. Diana offers to talk to her. Adam says that'll simplify things. He tells her to have fun and walks away. She chokes back tears.

Lee steps into the triangles with Faye and puts Cassie's necklace on Faye's wound, tethering her to Cassie. The triangle busts into flames around them.

On the dance floor Adam, then Diana, then Melissa all get woozy.

Faye walks out to her locker and finally is able to open it with a spell. She goes to the dance floor where a girl bumps into her. Faye freezes her glass in return and it shatters.

In the bathroom, Melissa passes out and hits her head on the counter.

Faye dirty dances with Lee and then runs into Cassie, who asks for her page. Faye says she forgot it. Cassie makes her angry so Faye goes a little bit Carrie on the dance. She turns fake fire displays into real fire, giving Diana a dizzy spell. Cassie seems fine. Faye keeps lighting and Diana slumps to the floor. Cassie realizes Faye is doing it and confronts her. Cassie tells her she's messing with power they don't understand. Cassie tells her that everyone else is affected.

Faye takes Lee into the hall and asks him how to sever the connection. He tells her to drop the necklace into oil and light it. She does, but the flames she lit in the displays only burn higher. The decorations from the dance start falling from the ceiling, nearly hitting people as they run for the exits. Adam's dad herds people out.

They all make it out, but realize Melissa's missing. Cassies goes back and uses her powers to clear a path through the fire to get to Melissa in the bathroom. Cassie makes it to her but passes out from the smoke. She sees a pair of men's boots in front of her as she closes her eyes.

Melissa and Cassie wake up on the lawn outside.

The circle confronts Faye. She points out Cassie released a demon that killed Nick and let witch hunter Jake into the circle and nearly choked Adam. ""How does this bitch get a free pass and I get burned at the stake?"" Faye asks. She storms off.

Adam's dad finds him, but is suspicious of Cassie.

Diana drives Melissa home. Melissa confesses she feels bad for Faye. She's worried about how much she thinks about power. Faye's starting to scare Melissa and Diana says Cassie is starting to scare her since she can't control her dark magic.

Faye goes back to Lee's.

Adam finds Cassie in the basement of the house. She wonders if her dad was trying to take away his own dark magic. She's looking for a spell in her mom's book. He playfully grabs for her book and they end up close. He kisses her.

The boots come down the basement stairs. Jake's back."

Cassie hides her dad's medallion in the secret compartment in her fireplace. She goes downstairs to leave and finds a woman at her door. ""You look so familiar, have we met before?"" Cassie asks. ""Sixteen years ago in the boatyard fire,"" the woman tells her.

Last week, her memory changed where she now recalls seeing Cassie back in the cafeteria telling Cassie to get out. She's Lucy Gibbons, a psychic. She says she helped Cassie's parents' circle and that Cassie's dad was a hero that day and his death was a tragedy.

Cassie tells her he escaped.

Lucy is jumpy and on edge and tells her witch hunters are coming for both of them. She says she owed it to Cassie's parents to warn her. She gives Cassie the name of her hotel and leaves.

Dawn unloads groceries and notices deep scratches on her hands, some of them scarred.

Charles knocks and immediately yells at her for sending Ethan to deal with him. Now Ethan has the crystal. Dawn laments them being on opposite sides.

""When you threatened to kill my mother it occurred to me that you and I aren't exactly on the same page,"" Charles says.

Dawn says she's just trying to get their powers back. Charles warns her he's going to get the crystal and the next time she crosses him will be her last.

At the Boat House, Ethan asks Diana for help planning a birthday party for Adam. She remembers a time she stuffed his locker full of cookies.

Cassie tells Jake about Lucy's warning. She's trying to find out how her dad's medallion works. They head down the basement where the symbol is carved. Cassie heard her dad recite a spell on the boat, but she can't remember it.

She stares at the medallion and becomes fixed to the spot. The house starts shaking around them. She tells Jake to leave, but when she says she can't move, he tackles her to the floor. The house stops shaking. Adam comes downstairs and sees them together on the floor. ""What the hell is going on?"" he asks.

Adam storms off and Cassie tells him about Lucy's warning. She wants to figure out how the medallion works, but he tells her all she needs is the circle.

Inside, Jake is surly, waiting to see what Cassie will do next. She wants to see Lucy.

At the Bout House, Faye shows Melissa the Devil's Spirit drug she got.

Cassie and Jake go to Lucy's hotel. She knows Jake has powers. Cassie asks about the medallion and Lucy tells her it could protect her, but it has to be unlocked by her circle. Lucy offers to meet them later at the abandoned house to help.

Cassie and Jake leave and there's another knock at the door. It's Dawn. She reminds Lucy that after the day Lucy ""betrayed"" them she told Lucy never to come back and marked her. She shows Lucy her torn up palm.

Cassie keeps Jake out as she goes for the medallion in her mantle hiding place. It's gone.

Dawn blames Lucy for letting John Blackwell die. She suggests a way Lucy can make up for her mistakes, by helping her locate the family crystals.

Cassie tries to figure out where the medallion could have gone and realizes only one person knew the hiding spot.

Cut to Adam's birthday party at the Boat House. Adam thanks his dad, who gives all credit to Diana.

Outside, Melissa and Faye wait to feel the effects of the Devil's Spirit. Melissa suggests they do more. Faye pours some out and the wind blows it away. Melissa tells her to get more.

Cassie joins the party. Diana suggests Ethan make a toast, then he passes it off to Diana. She says something heartfelt that clearly shows how much she cares. She hugs Adam as Cassie watches.

Charles talks to Ethan, saying they used to be just like the kids and apologizing. Then he drops something in Ethan's coffee and leaves.

Cassie confronts Adam about taking the medallion; he says someone has to stop her from hurting herself. She tells him about Lucy's offer to help unlock it so they can all be protected. Adam still doesn't trust Jake. She claims he's changed, but Adam thinks that's just what she wants to believe.

Faye's dealer Callum shows up. Melissa makes goo-goo eyes at him and he announces his plans to stay. Jake comes over and tells him to leave. Callum leaves, warning Jake to watch his back.

Adam brings Cassie her medallion back.

Ethan starts to feel the effects of whatever Charles put in his coffee. He goes to get some aspirin. Charles watches.

Jake finds Cassie outside. She asks him point blank if he's ever murdered a witch. He doesn't say anything and she has her answer.

Lucy comes to Dawn's house, where Dawn gathers photos to help them tap into each family's energies. Lucy smiles, saying they won't need them. Then she wheels around and stabs Dawn in the stomach.

Lucy says the witch hunters are coming back to Chance Harbor and, after tonight, the circle won't have any power to stop them. ""I've always been on the right side, Dawn, and it was never yours."" She leaves Dawn bleeding on the floor.

At the Boat House, Cassie tells the circle about activating the medallion. Everyone's in favor, so Adam goes along. Cassie tells Adam he was right about Jake. He says he can accept her dark magic, but doesn't think it defines her.

Charles creeps around Ethan's room and reaches into his pocket. He gets Ethan's crystal.

The circle waits in the woods behind the house for Lucy. She tells them to stand around the fire and hold hands.

Ethan wakes up and realizes the crystal is gone.

Lucy guides the circle through a spell. Cassie feels the medallion get warm around her neck. Melissa doesn't feel so good and wants to stop, but Lucy guides them on.

Faye starts to feel sick, too. Then Cassie can feel something's wrong. Melissa says it feels like it did when Faye took their magic at the dance.

Lucy admits the medallion is taking their powers.

They realize she's working with the witch hunters.

Cassie suddenly remembers what her father chanted on the boat. She recites a spell and the fire leaps out after Lucy. Cassie stalks her and says that if Lucy was really a psychic she'd know if her father was alive. Cassie taunts her with the fire to force her to answer.

Lucy says he is alive, but no one knows where he is.

Cassie tells Lucy to leave and never come back, and to tell the witch hunters she has the medallion and knows how to use it. Then she lets her run off.

Later, Jake offers to help Cassie find her father. She doesn't want his help. He tells her they're not so different and she'll need her anger to beat the witch hunters. She says she's not like him at all.

Charles goes to Dawn's house. When she doesn't answer, he looks in the window and sees her lying there, dead. He uses the crystal to get in and recites a spell to revive her.

Melissa drives to a shady part of town and meets Callum. She wants more Devil's Spirit, saying it made the night a lot easier. He warns her she went through the last bag quickly.

Faye responds to Jake's text and goes to his place. He grabs her and they start making out.

Adam opens a closet at the Boat House and bags of cookies pour out, just like Diana arranged in his locker once.

Lucy reports to the head witch hunter from the boat 16 years ago, who's angry she failed. He says she's left open the door for Blackwell's return by leaving the medallion behind. Lucy says Cassie was too strong. He slits her throat.

Down in the house basement, Cassie tries using the medallion again, this time in control. She feels the house begin to shake and breathes deeply. She opens her eyes. ""Daddy,"" she says."

They immediately start arguing, swearing it'll never happen again, and then they do it again.

At school, Cassie tells Diana about feeling a connection with her father through the medallion. She thinks he's trying to find her.

It's Valentine's Day. Faye tells Melissa about her night with Jake and that she got the power back in the relationship. Faye suggests a horror movie marathon for Valentine's Day. The girls are all in.

Cassie runs into Adam, who asks her out. She tells him about the slumber party and he suggests another night that's less pressure- filled. She likes the idea of a date.

Cassie runs to her car to get a book and doesn't notice the shrouded, reaper-like figure lurking nearby.

Lee shows up at Faye's house with a kind of voodoo doll that he promises will restore her power if she leaves it under her bed. He asks her to dinner, but she says no.

Issac shows up at Jake's. Jake is angry that Issac lied about how his parents died. Issac swears Eben wanted peace, but John Blackwell made the circle think the witch hunters were going to double cross them. He says Blackwell led his parents to slaughter.

Issac tells Jake that witch hunters are coming for Cassie and the circle, but he can stop it by giving them Cassie's medallion. He says the medallion brings evil.

Jake runs him off.

Cassie takes the medallion back to the basement of the house. She sees the shrouded figure standing there and she screams and runs.

She runs into Adam upstairs, then goes back down and looks around but no one is there. She recognizes the robe as the same one her father wore when the witch hunters tried to kill him and that they wore on Halloween. This one had a symbol on it.

Adam wonders why she'd want to look for a father that hasn't tried to find her in sixteen years.

Adam suggests Cassie asks Jake about the symbol.

At Faye's house, Faye gets knocked onto her weird voodoo stick and it breaks. Melissa pulls out her Devil's Spirit and takes some, offering it to Diana, who also takes it.

Jake tells Cassie the symbol belonged to the Nadaros coven, really old blood. They were destroyed years ago.

Stoned Diana suggests they do a spell on the pizza guy to make him hot. Diana promises to make out with him when he gets there. They hold hands and imagine. The doorbell rings and Diana answers, immediately kisses the guy standing there. It's Lee. Faye called him to fix the broken voodoo stick.

Still at home, Cassie gets the text from Diana to hurry up. She sees her medallion slide across the table and grabs it. Two shrouded figures stand outside her window.

Lee can tell Diana is tripping and warns Faye again how dangerous Devil's Spirit is. Meanwhile, the hot pizza guy comes and Diana kisses him, too.

Cassie finally arrives. Melissa does more Devil's Spirit on the sly.

Jake meets with Isaac and tells him Cassie is being hunted by dead Nadaros. Isaac says John Blackwell killed them and used the medallion to steal their powers. When she took the medallion she alerted every dead witch. Isaac warns the Nadaros are just the beginning. He says the medallion will end up killing the circle.

The girls sit around and eat pizza. Cassie tells them about seeing a ghost and the medallion moving.

Faye pulls out a Ouija board. Cassie asks what the person trying to contact her is saying. The medallion starts moving. It spells out ""SACRED."" They don't know what it means, but Faye and Melissa dissolve into giggles. Cassie isn't in the mood. Adam texts and asks if she wants to come over. Melissa busts her.

Cassie leaves and Jake arrives looking for her. Melissa tells him she went to Adam's.

Cassie drives by a ghost witch on her way. The medallion starts working its way up her chest, finally choking her. She struggles against it, swerving wildly. Her car flips and crashes.

Jake finds Adam on his boat lighting candles. Jake thinks she's in trouble. Adam grabs a knife and follows.

Cassie climbs out of her totaled car and rips the medallion off. She sees a shrouded figure nearby and runs to confront it.

Adam calls Diana, looking for Cassie. ""Maybe she found a third boyfriend,"" Diana says, hanging up.

Faye hears and asks her how it feels to be replaced by Cassie. Diana accuses Faye of being jealous of her friendship with Melissa, but Faye points out it was Diana who bailed on Melissa in junior high when she met Adam. They realize they haven't seen Melissa and find her on the floor, convulsing next to an empty bag of Devil's Spirit.

Jake and Adam find Cassie's car flipped over. Jake tells her the witches are after their power in the medallion. They were killed in a church nearby and spirits have more power near where they were murdered. If they lead her there, she's in danger.

Cut to Cassie racing through the woods after the witch ghost. She arrives at an old church.

Diana holds Melissa's hair while she throws up. Diana and Melissa blame each other.

Cassie goes into the church and sees a plaque that says ""Sacred Heart."" She runs in, yelling at whoever to come out. A figure appears. Then another. Suddenly she's surrounded.

Jake and Adam come in. Adam takes out his knife and runs to help, but Cassie tells him to run. The witch ghosts surround Adam and close in. Suddenly, the shrouds drop to the ground, empty, and Adam twitches.

The witches went into him. He advances on Cassie with his knife, possessed. He wants the medallion back. Jake explains that her dad killed them.

Adam starts to slice his own wrist as the witches make him demand the medallion. Jake yells at her that if they have it, six witches will have the power of thousands. Cassie doesn't feel like she has a choice.

She holds the medallion out to Adam, then grabs onto it. Adam stands frozen. Cassie crushes the medallion with her bare hand. Adam comes to and she rushes to him.

Jake takes the compressed medallion pieces back to Isaac. Jake wonders why he'd want it if he can't use it. Isaac says he can't protect Jake anymore.

Faye contemplates her weird voodoo stick and puts it under her bed. Diana comes for her stuff. Faye tells her to stay. Diana promises never to bail on Melissa as a friend again.

Lee takes his voodoo stick to a comatose girl hooked up to machines. He thanks Faye and tells the sleeping girl he found a way to make her better.

Back at anti-Valentine's Day central, Diana tells Melissa she has to quit the Devil's Spirit. They devolve into a pillow fight.

Back on Adam's boat, Cassie finally gets to see the spread he made for her. Cassie thinks Adam was right about her dad, and he should stay gone. Cassie worries that her dad being bad makes her bad. Adam assures her she's amazing. He kisses her.

On a pier somewhere, a man looks over the water. He has the image of the medallion in scar tissue on his hand."

Cassie got a job at Java Brew. Diana tells her dad about Jane coming home and he tries to look glad. Charles says he'll be sorry to see her go.

""Why do all the men in your life like you more than me?"" Diana asks. She's kidding.

Cassie comes home and finds the door open. She creeps around and finds Jake already inside. He thought he saw someone from his place and came to check. They notice dirt on the floor.

Jake checks outside. There's a ring of ash and salt around the house -- the kind of stuff witch hunters use to block a witch's power. Jake breaks the line. He didn't expect the witch hunters so soon. Jake and Cassie wonder why Isaac wanted a medallion he couldn't use.

Jake wants to stay and stand guard, but Cassie zaps him to prove she can take care of herself.

At the Java Brew, she brings a table their very complicated orders, but they haven't ordered yet. She packs up. Adam intercepts and shows her how to hold the tray and serve. She tells him witch hunters were in her house. Her grandmother isn't back yet, she just didn't want to impose on Diana anymore.

Adam invites himself over to Cassie's empty house.

Melissa and Faye have coffee in a booth. Melissa urges her to move on from Jake and try for Lee, but Faye doesn't want to ""date below her station."" Skeezy Callum, the drug dealer, wanders in and invites them to a party. Melissa considers it.

Back home, Cassie calls her grandma and says she's still with Diana and is eager for her to get home. She gets off the phone and hears steps on her porch. She sees someone at the door and goes to answer it. It flies open.

""Hello, Cassie, I'm John Blackwell. I'm your father,"" the man says. He tells her she can sense it.

He says no one could know he was alive, but when she activated the medallion he knew she was in trouble. She asks him to leave, saying she doesn't need his help. He says she does. Adam pulls up outside.

John asks her to meet him in an hour and promises to leave when he knows she's safe. He tells her not to tell anyone he came, because everything he's done since the day of the boat yard fire was to keep her from the situation she's in now. He leaves.

Adam comes in. She tells him ""something came up"" and then can't continue the lie. She tells him her father was just there.

He doesn't want Cassie to go meet him, but she wants the truth. She's sure he won't hurt her and wants to help. Adam thinks he's had a lot of chances to help and is there for something else. She wants to find out what.

Diana calls Faye, looking for Melissa, who is late to meet her. Faye tells her she's at Callum's. Diana convinces Faye they should go get her.

Lee sits over his girlfriend's bedside when Faye knocks at the garage. Diana doesn't remember kissing him. Lee is alarmed they let Melissa go to Callum's.

Callum practices left-hand voodoo, which is evil, and he uses people, Lee explains.

Cassie meets John Blackwell on the pier. If anyone had known he was alive, they would have come for Cassie and her mother. He loved Amelia.

Then he tells her to give him the medallion. Cassie is stunned and says Adam was right, he came for something other than her. Cassie yells that she doesn't need him and walks off.

She walks back to her car and gets in, where Ebben, lurking in her back seat, grabs her.

Ebben takes Cassie to his people and they tie her to a chair. He orders them to prepare her for the ceremony.

At a warehouse party with hookahs, skulls, and dozens of people, Lee immediately offers Melissa Devil's Spirit, but she turns him down. He takes out a voodoo totem and tells her to concentrate as they each hold one. He does something and Melissa feels a surge. She likes it and wants to do it again, but he tells her to switch totems first.

Faye, Diana and Lee arrive and split up to look for Melissa.

Melissa rubs her hand on her totem and then slaps it to send a surge to Callum. He is surprised by what he feels and wants to show her something.

At the abandoned house, Jake arrives looking for Cassie but sees John Blackwell and grabs him. Blackwell identifies himself and Jake tells him about the salt-ash. Jake hasn't been able to find her. He suggests Cassie might be with Adam at the boathouse. John leaves. Once gone, Jake runs off.

Cassie is still out cold and tied to the chair when Jake finds her and tries to help. The witch hunters grab him. He tells them about Blackwell and says he'll deliver him if they let Cassie go.

When Cassie wakes up, Ebben tells her the powder surrounding her is taking her power and that she destroyed the medallion John once used to overcome it. They hold her while Ebben put drops of something in Cassie's eyes and mouth.

Blackwell goes to the Boat House. He asks Adam where Cassie is, but Ethan comes out. Ethan warns Adam to stay away from Blackwell. ""Believe me when I tell you he is the last person you ever want to know, you or Cassie,"" Ethan says.

Adam sees Blackwell talk to Jake in the parking lot. Jake tells him the witch hunters have her. Blackwell gets in Jake's car.

Adam watches and calls Diana, asking her for help.

Callum takes Melissa up to his private room and locks the door. He asks what she is. He says he got more power from her than he gave her. He thinks she's a witch. He doesn't let her leave, so she bluffs, asking if he really wants to tempt her given how powerful she is.

He lets her go. She finds Faye. Melissa tells Faye that Callum has a totem just like the one Lee gave her and it doesn't give power, it takes it. Lee is using her. Diana finds them, saying Cassie's in trouble. Faye confronts Lee on the way out.

Jake takes Blackwell to the woods, admitting he has history with the witch hunters.

Ebben comes out with his hand over Cassie's mouth and a knife at her throat. Ebben tells Jake that he wants him rather than John now, to settle old scores. Jake surrenders himself. Ebben looks into Cassie's eyes, which turn black when he looks at them. He tells her to go to her father and she obeys.

Cassie leaves with her dad. Ebben puts Jake in iron shackles to keep his power in check. He says they don't have to kill Blackwell; Cassie will.

At the voodoo party, Callum confronts Lee about the circle. Lee tells him to stay away from them, but Callum says they're both using the girls.

As Cassie walks through the woods with her dad, she stops and picks up a branch. She twists it into a big wand and points it at her dad. He can't move. She doesn't know what's going on. He tells her she's been spelled. She traces a circle around him and lights it on fire. She yells at him to stop her, but he says he doesn't have magic anymore and he refuses to hurt her. He thinks she can overcome it.

Ebben marches Jake roughly through the woods and puts him on his knees. Jake's usefulness has come to an end. Ebben takes out a knife and prepares to kill Jake. Suddenly Ebben is flung backward through the air and impaled on a tree branch.

The rest of the circle arrives.

While they're freeing Jake, Ebben disappears. Somehow with a branch in his gut he got away.

The circle finds Cassie with her dad and tries to break her bond to the spell. Cassie concentrates and they break its hold. The fire goes away.

Blackwell is OK.

Back at the abandoned house, they worry over whether they did the right thing saving Blackwell. Adam has never seen his dad as scared as he was of Blackwell.

At her house, Blackwell tells Cassie that the Elders stripped her mother's generation of their powers after the boathouse fire and it affected him. Dark magic took everything he ever cared about. He doesn't think anyone will ever believe he's changed.

She tells him she destroyed the medallion. He says now she can't protect herself.

Cassie wants to know how Ebben spelled her if he's not a witch. She thinks he must be working with one.

Blackwell says he's staying in Chance Harbor until he finds out what's going on.

Faye comes home to find Lee in her room. He asks for the totem and snaps it, saying they'll find another way to get her power. He kisses her. She lets him.

Back at his house, his ex-girlfriend Eva wakes up. She looks scared.

Blackwell confronts Jake at his house for setting him up. He thanks Jake for saving Cassie's life. He suggests they work together.

Cassie goes to the Boat House to sit in Adam's arms."

He offers to answer whatever questions she has. She asks if he loved her mother. More than anyone in the world, he says, but she didn't talk about him because he hurt her and she probably thought it was best to forget him. He says she was afraid of him, for good reason, because dark magic changed him. Cassie thinks that's an excuse.

He tells her she can't control dark magic. She starts to show off, melting her coffee cup. She says she only uses it to protect people, and he says he did the same, but it made him vengeful and he lost the people he was trying to protect. The more you use it, the more it takes hold.

""Once dark magic takes ahold of you, it's impossible to get free,"" he tells her.

John runs into Jake outside, and checks that he's watching over Cassie.

At the coffee shop, the circle discusses. Jake suggests her dad can help them prepare for Ebben and the hunters. Cassie's not sure she trusts her father enough to ask for help.

Adam asks if they're going to casino night together, a real date out in public. She says hell yes and kisses him.

Lee sits by his girlfriend's bed. She's up and better. Eva thanks him for nursing her back to health. She doesn't want to call her parents because they gave up on her. She tells him he's her family now.

At the Boat House, Diana and Melissa gather party supplies. A hot Aussie offers suggestions, but Diana ignores his flirting.

Outside, Melissa suggests Diana didn't have to shut him down entirely, but Diana doesn't want to date anyone whom she might have to one day have a talk with about the fact she's a witch.

Grant follows them out and introduces himself. Melissa tells him about the fundraiser, but he says he's sailing out tonight.

Cassie goes to the abandoned house, her father's old house, and is surprised to see him there looking around. He removes a secret compartment in the wall and looks around, then he flips a table over in a sudden burst of rage. She hides.

Cassie tells Adam what she saw and that he was looking in the post in the big room.

Faye drops by Lee's, asking him to casino night. She sees Eva's shoes and tells him not to live in the past. He says he can't make it tonight. Faye storms off.

Adam and Cassie sneak into Jake's house. He finds something in the closet that he hid there. He and Jake's brother took it from the post in the house. It's a sway, used to take other witches' powers.

Cassie wants it to ask her father about. She thinks it'll be fine because she'll be the one holding it.

At the coffee shop, Faye tries to make sense of Lee's indifference. Melissa suggests she not take no for an answer.

John comes by Cassie's. She called him. She shows him the sway. He says it doesn't take away powers, it temporarily transforms them to a mortal, which is how Ebben had power on the boat that day. Only another witch could have spelled it for him, someone on the boat that day.

John says he needs the sway to find Ebben and assures Cassie she can trust him. She sends him away without it.

Faye shows up back at Lee's in a low cut dress. She runs into Eva. Lee comes home and kisses Eva hello. Lee pretends he doesn't know Faye and she leaves.

At casino night, Grant shows up with hundreds of dollars for chips. He flirts again and Diana reciprocates.

Adam comes for Cassie. She tells him her dad's theory about someone from his circle helping Ebben that day on the boat. Adam immediately gets defensive about his dad and soon they're arguing. He leaves.

Cassie goes to Jake's, asking if he remembers seeing Ethan that day. Cassie's looking for another explanation of who might have helped Ebben, if not Ethan. Jake says her protecting Adam might put them all in danger.

She leaves and Jake calls John Blackwell. John's walking up to the Boat House when he sees Adam tear up in his car. Inside, Adam asks his dad what happened with John Blackwell. Ethan tells him not to worry about it and to fight for things with Cassie.

Ethan leaves for the fundraiser.

At casino night, Faye is extra surly about Lee. He shows up. He tells her Eva recently got better. Faye is angry and tells him she's not going to wait for him to choose. He grabs her and kisses her.

Dawn sneaks up on John Blackwell in the hallway. She immediately starts flirting with him and suggests they find a way to get their power back. John is looking for Ethan.

Adam arrives and apologizes to Cassie. They both say the other's dad is OK. He suggests they hear her dad out. Dawn tells Cassie her dad is looking for Adam's father.

At the blackjack table, Faye and Melissa use their magic to clean up.

Faye and Lee are giggling and cuddly when suddenly they see Eva standing there. Lee says he didn't know how to tell Eva. Eva calls Faye a ""coping mechanism"" and tells him she's better than her. When Lee doesn't run to her, Eva leaves.

John Blackwell leaves the party. Someone follows him out with a knife in their hand.

Later, Jake walks into the party. He stares moodily at Cassie. Melissa tells Jake not to be so obvious and that Cassie is really into Adam.

Grant presents his winning tickets to Diana and gets two stuffed monkeys in return. He gives her one.

Cassie runs outside in time to see someone stabbing her father. She checks that her dad is OK then runs after his attacker. She uses her magic to turn on the flood lights on the field and trips him up with broken bleachers.

The attacker is knocked out. Cassie runs up to him and wields a piece of the broken wood. She sees it's Ethan. She's about to whack him when her dad runs over and tells her to just let him go. She does.

Back home, John explains Ethan wasn't the traitor, but Ethan blames John for stealing Amelia. Cassie tells her dad he was right about her dark magic, it was pushing her places she didn't want to go. He tells her to stop using all magic because the results of using the dark magic are worse than whatever she might use it to prevent.

Grant walks Diana to her car. He says he's leaving tomorrow morning, but might come back. She kisses him. He says he'll be back.

Lee comes home to a very angry Eva. She asks why he bothered to bring her back if he wanted Faye. She says they belong together and she came back from the dead for him. She calls Faye a slut so Lee turns to leave. Eva shuts the door in front of him. He realizes she has magic now, a side effect over her OD on Demon Spirit or from his using Faye's witch power to revive her.

He tells her he'll help her through whatever she's going through, but they're over. ""You used to say we'd grow old together, that's how it has to be,"" she tells him.

Suddenly he starts gasping for breath and falls to the floor. She watches as he convulses, turns gray and dies.

John visits Ethan and opens by asking him how Ethan could betray his own circle. Ethan says Ebben was only supposed to take John.

John appreciates Ethan having the decency to be haunted by it. John says he'll keep Ethan's secret to protect their children but tells Ethan not to tell the Elders or anyone about Cassie's powers.

Ethan says Amelia helped him, she wanted John dead. He tells John that Cassie and Adam are meant to be together just like he and Amelia were.

John scoffs. For the Blakes and the Conants, ""written in the stars"" isn't destiny, it's a curse, he says.

Adam shows up on Cassie's doorstep. She tells Adam that their dads were fighting and she got caught in the middle of it and lost control.

Adam says he's sick of both their dads when they get in the way of their relationship.

Adam goes to kiss her, but she stops him. She's worried about hurting him, but he's not afraid of her. He tells her he loves her.

They start kissing and stripping.

They bask in their happiness. There are dead crows all around the house outside.

John Blackwell drops by and tells them their knocking boots unleashed a curse designed to keep the Blakes and Conants apart. Amelia told him about it. She was scared of it. The dead crows are just a harbinger. John suggest Cassie's grandmother might know more.

Faye visits Lee's shop and runs into Eva. Eva says Lee was struggling with his feelings and needed time to think. Faye tries to open a door and Eva yells at her, then, when Faye's back is turned, she flings a glass canister at her head with magic. It narrowly misses Faye and she leaves.

Faye meets with Diana and Melissa over coffee and suggests Eva did something to Lee. She wants to search Lee's car.

Cassie and John visit Jane in a rest home. She thinks Cassie is her mother, Amelia, and asks why she brought John. Jane tells Cassie she has to tell Ethan the truth. Generations ago, a seer witch cursed the Conants and the Blakes to stop them from ever coming together. It was done out of jealousy. Cassie asks what would happen if they awaken the curse by getting together. Someone in the circle will die.

At the abandoned house, Cassie and Adam tell the circle, including Diana -- awkward! -- about awakening the curse. Faye thinks it was just something the parents said to keep the kids from having sex.

Jake wakes up at his place hearing voices. Cassie barges in. He's been in bed all day with a fever. His veins look creepy. ""We need to talk,"" Cassie says.

Cassie and Adam try to break the news to Jake. ""It took a curse to figure out being with Adam is a colossal mistake?"" Jake asks.

John thinks he found an elixir in a book of shadows that will reverse the curse, but they need rare ingredients from Calvin Wilson, the antiquities owner. Jake doesn't mention that he killed him.

Dawn invites Charles over to share the news about John Blackwell. She tells him Blackwell visited Jane at the home. She worries Jane will get her memory back and then they'll be exposed for killing Henry, but Charles doesn't want to ever work with Blackwell.

Dawn tells him to remember who killed Amelia and that he's in danger if Blackwell ever finds it out.

At the antiquities shop, Calvin's niece tells them he's been missing for months. They have all but one ingredient, which grows in hollowed out trees. Adam and Cassie go to look for it, but sick Jake insists on going with them. He gets freaked out when he thinks he sees Calvin's reflection in a mirror on the wall.

At Lee's house, Faye, Diana and Melissa look in Lee's trunk and find nothing. As Faye looks for clues, a cop pulls up and asks for registration.

Diana talks to the cop, saying her friend is a distraught ex and blah blah blah. Melissa and Faye use magic to pop open Diana's blouse as she talks to him. They end up in the back of a cruiser, but Eva comes out and convinces the cop to let them go.

Eva tells Faye that Lee took his motorcycle. Diana apologizes and they leave.

In the woods, Cassie, Adam and Jake look for the special ingredient. Jake asks Adam about the sex and tells Cassie she knows he and she should be together.

Jake stops for water and reaches in his bag. He pulls out something that he sees as a witch cruet. He asks if Calvin gave it to them. He throws it, but it's just a water bottle. The black veins are reaching his heart. They have to hurry.

Dawn and Charles visit Jane in the home. She thinks Amelia's just out for a minute. Charles takes out the crystal and waves it in front of Jane. They ask what she told John Blackwell.

Back in the forest, Cassie is feeling guilty and Jake is freaking out, hearing someone whisper ""murderer."" He thinks Adam is Calvin. He sees Calvin taunt him that he's going to die and Jake protests that he was only doing what the witch hunters told him to do, but he's not a witch hunter anymore. Jake lunges at Adam, tackling him to the ground and choking him.

Cassie starts to use black magic, but in the midst of getting choked, Adam tells her not to. She concentrates with him instead. Cassie and Adam realize Jake killed Calvin Wilson.

Back at the house, John works on the elixir. He tells Melissa about learning from her mother.

In the woods, Cassie finds the ingredient they're looking for. Cassie feels guilty that Jake killed Calvin because Calvin tried to warn her. Cassie thanks Adam for preventing her from using dark magic.

Back at Lee's, Faye sneaks in again. She finds his motorcycle. Eva confronts her in the dark. Faye threatens to get the cops, but Eva slams the door shut with magic. This time, Faye sees it's magic. She asks if she's a witch, but Eva says Lee brought her back from the brink of death. Faye realizes Lee gave Eva her power with the totem.

Eva realizes Faye is a witch and suddenly asks her for help. She drags Faye into Lee's room, where his black body lies on a bed.

Faye yells at Eva, telling Eva she killed and it can't be undone. Eva says she doesn't want the magic, she just wants Lee back. Faye tells her Lee's gone. Eva gets angry and starts turning Faye's hand black.

Adam and Cassie bring Jake back to the house. Cassie thanks John for his help, but he ominously tells her there's something she needs to know.

Back at Lee's, Faye puts up a brave face, telling Eva what they need to do to bring Lee back. She tells Eva she's very powerful. She tells Eva to kneel beside the bed and close her eyes. Faye kneels and fishes under the bed for the totem Lee used to take her powers and give them to Faye. She finds it but tries to distract Eva by asking for candles.

Eva catches her reaching for the totem and grabs it.

Faye runs for it, but Eva uses magic to throw her across the room. Faye gets up and grabs the totem. She snaps it.

Eva loses her power. She tells Faye she didn't mean to kill Lee.

Jake is at death's door when Cassie brings the elixir up. She has tears in her eyes. She tells Adam the elixir isn't for Jake, it's for them. They have to drink it to break the curse and they'll forget why they love each other. Adam suggests they could just let Jake die, but Cassie says that'll make them the killers.

Adam tells her there's nothing that can make him forget how much he loves her. He kisses her. They both drink.

The next morning, Jake wakes up feeling better. He heard Adam and Cassie destroy their relationship. He doesn't think he was worth the sacrifice.

John Blackwell tells him he matters as a part of the circle. Jake tells him he killed Calvin. John says that's in the past. He assures him people can change.

Cassie and Adam wake up on the couch snuggled together. Adam says he feels weird, like he's not nervous around her anymore. He doesn't feel in love with her anymore. She says she feels the same. She remembers every minute they spent together, but like it was in a movie.

Adam says it was important to save Jake's life. He kisses her good bye on the cheek. Adam leaves and Cassie hyperventilates a little.

Faye tells Melissa and Diana about Eva and how sad and alone she was.

John visits Cassie, who's been crying. She still loves Adam. John says her power must be too strong to be affected by the elixir. She breaks down crying and he hugs her, saying he had no idea.

She wants to be alone and he promises he's nearby if she needs him.

At night in the home, Charles wakes Jane up. He tells her he's there to make her better. He's going to help her so she'll help him destroy John Blackwell. He takes out the crystal.

Dawn confronts John Blackwell outside Cassie's. There's no such thing as a Blake-Conant curse, but somehow he got Jane to say there was. Dawn says she knows he still has power. She thinks he's driving Adam and Cassie apart because he's afraid of their destiny, just like he was afraid of Amelia and Ethan.

John finally says yes, and asks Dawn if she knew that Amelia and Ethan's love was so strong they were planning on leaving the circle that day, and their absence left Dawn totally defenseless against the witch hunters. The massacre wouldn't have happened if the circle had worked together, he says.

John admits he has enough magic to spell Jane, make Jake sick and kill birds, but not enough to protect Cassie. He can't stop all the witch hunters, who are using magic. Dawn says she didn't know. John warns her not to question him again.

Cassie climbs into bed alone."

Across the room, Melissa says watching them is like an emotional car crash. Faye says the way Adam followed Cassie around was pathetic and she's glad it's over.

Melissa asks Cassie how it's going and she pretends it's no big deal. Adam joins them and asks them to waitress at a hockey function at the Boat House tomorrow.

Cut to a young man running for his life through the woods as he's pursued by men with flashlights. We see Ebben is leading the chasing pack.

John Blackwell visits Cassie at the coffee shop to check up on her. She hasn't told anyone the elixir didn't work on her. He asks her if she wants to go mini-golfing some time.

At the Boat House, everyone gets ready for the hockey function. Grant the hot Aussie comes by and sends Diana a flute of sparkling cider then asks to whisk her away. Diana bails on the hockey function and goes with him.

The boy who was being chased shows up at Jake's place and Jake immediately attacks him, asking what he's doing there. Cassie sees them fighting from her house and races over. She uses magic to help fling the guy across the room, but Jake explains he's a friend.

He's Samuel, a witch hunter. He says he's there to talk to John Blackwell. Samuel says Ebben will kill him to keep him from telling Blackwell what he knows: Ebben is resurrecting demons.

Melissa and Faye wait on hockey jocks and they debate the benefits of dating outside the witchy world. Faye makes a play for Kyle the hockey player before Melissa can. Melissa recruits Adam to help her beat out Faye. He tells her to go talk to him and think hockey.

She shoves Faye aside and Adam talks through her, showing off hockey knowledge and total recall for Kyle's own moves in games. He's totally dumbfounded and impressed, as is the table full of players.

Grant breaks into a hockey rink with Diana. He explains his dad taught him to sail, but they don't get along. She says it must be great to live a life of adventure and he invites her to come with him. She thinks he's being impulsive, but he says he's thought about it a lot. She kisses him. He invites her to his boat, but she says no.

Blackwell comes to Cassie's house to talk to Samuel, who they have tied up in the kitchen. Blackwell talks to him alone.

Blackwell tests Samuel, who passes by saying Ebben is working with a witch. Samuel says no one knows who it is. He says Ebben has become paranoid and is worse than the witches they were trying to stop.

He plans to summon the demons at Harbor Woods, just like Blackwell did 16 years ago. They know Blackwell tried to give the demons bodies of witches so they could walk among people. He was going to use their power against his enemies.

Cassie comes in and hears the end of what Samuel says about Blackwell sacrificing a mortal and burying them at the site of the ceremony. Ebben was going to sacrifice Samuel, which is why he ran.

Faye confronts Adam for helping Melissa. She wants some payback. Faye joins Kyle playing darts and, with Adam's magic help, throws a bulls eye and helps Kyle do the same.

Blackwell admits to Cassie that he summoned the demons, but there was no sacrifice, his blood was enough. He wanted to use the demons to stop the witch hunters, but they wanted to possess the circle. Amelia spelled the demons and trapped them before they took over the circle.

Blackwell says they have to seal the ground where the demons come up. Cassie still doesn't know her dad has magic, so he tells her to gather the circle at the abandoned house.

At the hockey function, Kyle's girlfriend joins them. Adam confronts Kyle for flirting with Melissa and Faye all night and not appreciating having a girlfriend in the first place. Adam throws a punch, but it's quickly broken up.

In the storage room, Melissa and Faye confront Adam, who says he's just on edge. He knows that everything was perfect, but he can't remember the feeling. Melissa says he's lucky not to miss what he had.

Cassie calls, telling them to meet at the house. Cassie goes looking for Diana.

Diana shows up on the dock looking for Grant. She finds him with a man who says he's the captain. Grant is forced to admit he lied to her, he's just the crew. She walks off.

Blackwell leads Samuel out into a field. He sent the circle to the abandoned house to distract them, what they're doing is too dangerous. Samuel stops walking for a second, we see a worm demon slithering under his skin.

Cassie finds Diana staring off into space at the coffee shop. Cassie acts urgent and Diana tells her Faye was right to call her a drama queen. Diana just wants five minutes alone, but mocks Cassie, saying whatever is going on with her is more important. Cassie tells her about the demons.

At the house, they realize Blackwell brought the demons they buried in the suitcase to Chance Harbor. Jake defends Blackwell, saying he's trying to make up for his mistakes. Adam reminds Jake those mistakes killed his brother.

Diana and Cassie arrive and see Blackwell's not there. Cassie realizes he's protecting them.

Blackwell and Samuel reach the charred earth where he brought up the demons. He draws symbols in the dirt, then steps outside the circle. Samuel can't get out.

Blackwell examines the worm demon under Samuel's skin and tells Samuel there's a demon in him; he's already been sacrificed.

Samuel cries that he didn't know and begs Blackwell to get it out. Blackwell explains that the circle will draw the demon out of him to prevent Ebben from completing the ritual. But then Ebben steps out from the shadows.

Ebben taunts Blackwell for not having magic as Samuel contorts in the circle. Ebben plans to raise the demons to kill every witch alive, but he plans to kill Blackwell now. Ebben flings Blackwell through the air then chants and slices his hand.

The circle shows up. Jake sees Samuel and tries to get him, accidentally breaking the circle in the dirt and letting the demon out. With Ebben distracted chanting, the circle tries to keep Samuel in place, but it doesn't work.

Cassie tries alone, turning a metal stake into a flame thrower and lighting Samuel. It seems to be working, but then Samuel douses the flames and picks Cassie up by the throat. Blackwell comes to and yells at Samuel to stop. He offers himself.

Samuel taunts that with no power, Blackwell has nothing he wants. But Blackwell raises his hand and uses his magic to burst Samuel into a thousand firey bits.

Ebben keeps chanting and takes in the demons. The circle goes after him, but Blackwell yells at them to let him go. With the demons in him, he's too strong. Cassie confronts her dad about having magic.

""How could I convince you to stop using your magic if I was using mine?"" he asks. She points out his magic saved them.

But Blackwell says with the demons, Ebben is now more powerful than all of them.

Back at the house, Blackwell gives a pep talk, essentially saying it's time for witches to rally. ""This war has to end now, we can't just sit back and be victims anymore, we have to rise up,"" he says. He says witchcraft is the answer, the only one.

Their circle doesn't have enough power, but they could with crystals. Bound together, they're the strongest magic.

Cassie says she has one. The circle with six crystals can destroy the witch hunters. They could stop hiding forever.

Grant waits at Diana's house. She doesn't want to hear his explanation. He says he wanted to impress her and didn't want to see her walk away. He says he panicked and is sorry, and everything else is true. Diana says in her world, people who lie are dangerous. He jokingly asks if she's a spy.

She says she doesn't have room in her life for liars, but he asks for one more day to prove himself to her. She gives it to him.

Adam drives Cassie home. He admits he was wrong about her dad. She forgives him. Adam says Blackwell was right, they have to go after what they want and be focused on their enemies right now. ""Nothing else matters,"" he says. Cassie says he's right and rushes to get out of the car. He stops her and tells her she was amazing with the witch hunters.

At the house, Faye grabs Cassie's crystal to play with it. She shatters glass until John Blackwell rips it out of her hands. They have to get the crystals from the Elders before the witch hunters attack. He thinks the Elders will be suspicious of them and might strip their powers, too, so they can't just ask for help.

They make plans to go visit their respective grandparents. John urges them to go in groups so they can use their circle magic. Cassie tells her dad that her grandmother will be home tomorrow, she hopes they can get along.

Diana meets with Grant, who brought a big bouquet of tulips. His captain is letting them him borrow the boat for a romantic trip to the San Juan Islands. Diana thinks she has to cancel, but Adam and Melissa say they can go to her grandmother's alone.

Creepy Callum the witch groupie stops Melissa on the street. She's trying to brush him off when Jake joins in. Callum gives Jake a hard time and Jake throws him against a tree, but Melissa diffuses the whole situation.

Cassie comes home to find Jane already there. Jane says she'll try to get along with John.

Cassie waits for Faye with Jake. She says it's hard being around Adam right now, but he wants to know why since she's not supposed to remember her feelings for him after the elixir. Faye joins them and they drive off, none of them noticing Callum following on a motorcycle.

In Melissa's grandmother's house they find she has a boatload of crystals, just regular ones. They go through them.

Jake goes to his grandfather's. His parents kept them away from him, they said he was crazy.

When he doesn't answer, they use magic to get in to his cabin. There are stacks of newspapers everywhere and a giant conspiracy wall ""from Salem to Satan and a lot of weird crap in between."" Cassie notices a piece of paper on the wall with the names of the Circle and their birthdates. Cassie takes a picture of it.

There are drawings and newsclippings.

The last time Jake saw him was when he crashed his parents' funeral screaming about the end of the world.

John Blackwell intercepts Charles, explaining he came back for Cassie. Charles thinks John betrayed them by summoning demons that day. He also thinks John killed Diana's mom, Elizabeth, that night.

Jake, Cassie and Faye are still in the cabin when his grandfather comes home. He doesn't think it's really Jake until they use their powers. He didn't know Jake's brother Nick was dead. He tells Jake the circle will be the death of all of them.

Charles comes to Jane's. He's late. Jane's carving a symbol in the coffee table to immobilize John Blackwell. She has a witch cruet she made 16 years ago to kill him. She underestimated the hold he had on Amelia. They're ready to kill him now.

Jake's grandfather explains: 300 years ago, 18 families escaped from the Salem witch trials. They split into three circles, two stayed east. One went to Chance Harbor. Sixteen years ago a Balcoin descendant named John Blackwell tried to corrupt the circle with dark magic to kill witch hunters.

He never believed that Blackwell could have been outsmarted, he knew he had to corrupt the circle from within. ""What Blackwell really wanted was children,"" he says.

He wanted to ensure the next circle would have dark blood. If the two other circles were turned to darkness like this one and they're brought together, it would tip the balance of power in the war between good and evil.

Jake thinks his grandfather is kooky, but Cassie listens. She asks about the crystals.

He says his crystal is in a mine and spelled so that no witch with dark magic can go near it. The six crystals form a crystal skull, the most powerful form of magic in the world.

Diana prepares for her date with Grant, but Adam calls. Melissa comes to get Diana and she makes an excuse to Grant. Diana goes downstairs to find Melissa and Adam with a bag of quartz. They think Melissa's grandmother spelled her crystal to hide its power, they need her to make their magic stronger to find it. Grant comes down and doesn't really buy Diana's excuse about a school project.

He leaves, they find the right crystal and Diana leaves for her dream date.

Back in the woods, Faye shows Cassie her mom's diary. Faye wonders if Blackwell is her father, too. Jake offers that Isaac once told him Cassie wasn't the only child of Blackwell in the circle. He dismissed it because it was Isaac.

They hear a crash and go in the house and find a window broken and Grandpa's map to the crystal in the mine gone. Callum rides off.

Cassie has a picture of it on her phone and sends it to Adam and Melissa to beat Callum to the mine.

Jake says good-bye to his grandfather.

Cassie tells Faye there's no way she's a Blackwell. Then she reminds Faye that her dark magic didn't come out until Diana's grandmother tried to kill her; she's happy to recreate the experience for Faye.

Diana and Grant head for the boat but she gets a text. She doesn't give him a good answer and he reminds her trust goes both ways. She offers a rain check, but he doesn't know if he'll be coming back. She kisses him then runs off.

Adam and Melissa reach the abandoned spooky mine. They seem to be the first ones there. It's an iron ore mine, magic won't work. ""This is a dangerous place to be normal,"" Adam says. They find lights and head down.

Jane offers John coffee. He sits at her table and Charles approaches him from behind with the crystal. John is immobilized. Charles is ready to light the cruet and kill him, but Jane wants to know the truth about Amelia's death first. Charles is less eager, since he's responsible.

The mine makes spooky mine noises. Adam and Melissa reach an open shaft. Adam grabs a rope and Indiana Joneses across it, leaving Melissa on the other side. He climbs up to the beams and finds the crystal. He swings back to the other side, but comes up a little short. Melissa grabs him.

They're heading for the exit when they see Callum coming. They hide and let him pass and run, but they circle back around and end up face to face with him and he's armed.

He demands the crystal. Adam goes for his gun but doesn't get it. Melissa hands over the crystal and he leaves.

Outside, Jake, Faye and Cassie pull up just behind Diana. They see Callum running. Jake and Cassie go to check on Melissa and Adam, but Cassie and her dark magic can't go into the mine.

Faye and Diana try to intercept Callum as he speeds off. Faye stands in his bike's path, saying she needs to access her own magic. She tries to stop him, playing chicken as she stands there, but nothing happens. At the last second, Diana jumps on her and pushes her out of the way.

Cassie and Jake run out of the mine and Cassie stops Callum's bike.

Back at Jane's, John tells her he knew nothing about Amelia's death. He points out she ran away from both of them and the fact the crystal isn't turning black means he's telling the truth.

Charles wants to go through with killing John but Jane refuses since he didn't kill Amelia. Charles picks up the cruet and drops the match in.

But John is fine.

Jane drops to the floor and her flesh turns color. She's dead.

John says he had days alone in the house remembering how much Jane hated him. He found the cruet and remade it for Jane. He spells Charles so he won't remember what happened and says he has use for him or he'd be dead, too. John takes the crystal.

Jake and Adam pin down Callum. Jake slices his hand and recites a spell, marking Callum. If he ever comes back to Chance Harbor again, they'll know.

Faye finds John at the house, with the crystal. She mentions her mom's diary about him. He says Dawn had a crush on him, but it didn't go beyond that. He says Faye's not his daughter. John says her father loved her mother.

Cassie comes to Diana's. Diana needs to take a break from the circle. Cassie tells her if they don't work together they could be killed. Diana says she'll see the witch hunter thing through, then she's out. Cassie reminds her Adam and Melissa could have been killed at the mine.

Diana says she ran to help them before the others got there but she couldn't get in the mine, it felt like she was choking. Cassie tells her the mine was spelled, keeping black magic out. This means Diana is the other Blackwell in the circle. ""You're my sister,"" Cassie says."

Dawn tells John Blackwell she could help, if she had her power back.

Cassie retreats upstairs. Adam joins her. Cassie's upset over losing the only thing she had left of her mom. Now there's no one left alive who knows her. Adam says he knows her. She kisses him. John interrupts.

Cassie gives him grief about being Diana's dad. He says Amelia was the love of his life and he slept with Elizabeth once when he and Amelia were broken up. He says the tragedy should show her how close the witch hunters are.

""I want to destroy them, now. We need to find those last two crystals,"" she says.

Faye sets her sights on her mom's purse and her happy pills. She gets Jake to help her swipe them.

Diana comes home and asks her dad why he missed the wake.

Then she asks what her mom's relationship was with John Blackwell. She asks if he could be her father. Charles is shocked. He hems and haws, then says he and her mom separated just for a few weeks.

He tells her to stay away from John Blackwell because he'll gain her trust and convince her to do things she never thought she'd do. She promises.

At the abandoned house, Cassie apologizes to Adam for kissing him. Blackwell calls them to locate the last two crystals with Melissa. Their powers and the crystals will locate the others on the map. It shows only one -- in the house next to Cassie's.

Cut to Jake and Faye stripping in his room. She takes out her mom's pills to help her forget what they're doing. She opens the bottle -- and finds her family's crystal.

Back at the house, Faye brings it to the group. But the crystal doesn't have any powers. They figure Adam's grandfather's is cloaked.

Blackwell says there's a spell to re-juice Faye's but they need the whole circle. They make plans to meet up later that night.

Cassie drops by Diana's. She's ignoring everyone. She's not sure doing what Blackwell says is the best idea.

Adam goes through his grandfather's stuff with Melissa. He tells her about Cassie kissing him. Melissa's solution is booze.

At the house, Diana shows up and announces to Faye and Jake that Blackwell is her dad. Jake tells her about his grandfather's theory that Blackwell had two children in the circle. Faye mentions Blackwell's appearance in her mom's journal. Diana wonders if they should be trusting him.

The table with the dead crystal on it starts spinning and suddenly it melts through the table and disappears.

They figure it was the traitor witch, trying to stop them from putting together the crystal skull. Jake suggests talking to Isaac to help them get the crystal to stop Ebben. Diana doesn't want to tell Blackwell the plan.

Charles comes home to find a note from Diana saying she's with Cassie. He calls Blackwell.

Drunk Melissa asks Adam if he has feelings for Cassie. He says he doesn't. He tells her about the curse. Then he sees his grandfather's lucky coin framed on the wall. He takes it down, remembering a trick his grandfather used to do.

He tries to recreate it, and manages to cloak the coin. But he doesn't know how to uncloak it.

Jake, Faye, Cassie and Diana head out to the woods to meet Isaac. Ian shows up instead.

Charles meets Blackwell at the coffee shop. Blackwell reminds him they're in public and asks what he's going to do. Charles decks him and knocks him to the ground. Blackwell gets up and chokes him, but Charles says he's taking Diana away from Chance Harbor.

Dawn goes through her purse and realizes her crystal is missing.

In the woods, Ian says he's there because Isaac is dead. They recognize him as one of the people who kidnapped them and took them to the boat. Cassie thinks he killed her grandmother and starts choking him with dark magic. No one can stop her, except Diana, who shouts at her to stop.

Diana reminds Cassie they don't know Ian killed her grandmother. Ebben killed Isaac because he turned on him.

Ebben told Isaac to kill the witch traitor after the traitor helped them summon the demons, but Isaac refused. The witch escaped, so Ebben killed Isaac instead. Ian doesn't know who the traitor was, but he tracked him to Chance Harbor.

Diana suggests if Isaac could turn, maybe the rest could. Cassie reminds her how well an attempted truce worked for their parents.

Back at the house, Diana says she'll never use her dark magic. Cassie, Diana, Faye and Jake try to find the crystal and see it's near Hudson Fields.

Adam tries to remember the uncloaking words. He does an etching of the invisible coin and recites the words. The coin reappears, as does a secret panel in the wall.

Blackwell visits Dawn, and tells her Diana is his daughter. He wants her to keep Charles from taking Diana out of town. He tells her he needs the whole circle to make the skull and defeat the witch hunters. He promises to get her power back if she helps; he says the Elders won't be around to object because they'll take them out next.

He tells her Faye took her crystal. She agrees to talk to Charles.

Adam opens the secret compartment and finds a box -- but the crystal isn't in it. They need the map.

Faye sees something on a ride. It's dead Ian with his throat slit. They turn on the power to the ride and car after car of dead witch hunter goes by.

They keep looking through the amusement park and find blood. They follow it into the Haunted Mansion.

John Blackwell suggests that when Nick drowned, the demon kept him alive. Melissa is excited he's alive, but they point out it's not really him. ""He definitely more into massacring people than he used to be,"" Faye says.

Jake says the witch hunters were mauled like by an animal. Melissa wants to help him, but Jake insists it's too late.

Diana refuses to talk to Blackwell, saying she doesn't trust him. He sets Cassie on using her Balcoin blood to find the crystal in the high school. He reassures her he just wants what's best for them.

Cassie heads to the school. She draws the symbol on the floor and then immediately sees her young mom walk by holding the crystal, shouting for Elizabeth.

At Diana's, Cassie tells her about seeing her mom calling for Diana's. Cassie suggests that together they might be able to see what happened to their mothers. Diana doesn't want to use dark magic.

""All we need is your blood, so you can keep your moral outrage intact,"" Cassie says, only partly joking. Diana agrees.

They plan to try tomorrow at the prom. Cassie's never been to one before. ""It usually doesn't involve ancient crystals and time travel,"" Diana says.

Faye follows Jake home, suggesting maybe he's over-reacting a little to Melissa's feelings for Nick. He takes out a dagger to protect him from Nick if he comes back.

Charles checks that Diana is staying away from Blackwell. He gives her a present for prom, a gold flower necklace that used to belong to her mother. He offers to give her a ride to school.

At school, Cassie tells Adam the plan. They make plans to meet at the house before prom.

Charles drops Diana off at school. Dawn tells Charles she'll talk to Blackwell. Charles is worried about letting the most evil man they know get that much power.

Later, Melissa is the first to the house. Nick is waiting for her. He looks half dead and wants her help. He wants a crystal. He says he's dying. She promises to help him and tries to reassure him, but he shouts for the crystal. When Adam comes in, Nick knocks Melissa over and runs.

Blackwell talks to Dawn, thinking Charles is the problem. She points out people saw him fighting with Charles and will know it's him if something happens to Charles. Blackwell says he has dirt on Charles that will break his bond with Diana. He leaves and Dawn immediately calls Charles, but she gets his voice mail.

At the house, they pop champagne and try not to think about Nick. Melissa tries to make a case for Nick, but they think he's a threat.

They head to prom. Cassie and Diana go get coffee and Diana sees Grant. Cassie prods her to talk to him but then interrupts when she gets a text about Nick. Diana invites Grant over later.

Charles gets a call -- it's the conversation Cassie had with Amelia the night she died. Blackwell lurks outside his house. Dawn calls Charles again, but all he hears is Amelia and Cassie. Charles starts to freak out. The sinks starts spraying and his stove flames, lighting his kitchen on fire just life Amelia's. He slips on the water and lands on the floor. He asks Amelia to forgive him.

Charles opens his eyes and sees that everything in normal in his kitchen.

The circle finds an empty classroom. Cassie cuts her finger and draws the symbol, then Diana does while the others stand watch outside. They're suddenly in 1995.

Amelia goes to tell Elizabeth she needs to get out of town. Amelia says something bad is going to happen and she should take Diana and leave. It's the day of the boat fire. Amelia knew.

Demon Nick arrives at the dance. A cop tries to stop him, but Nick snaps his neck and goes in.

In 1995, Amelia tells Elizabeth that John isn't what they thought he was and they shouldn't have trusted him. Elizabeth knows John is dangerous. Amelia admits she was wrong about him and just found out a few days ago. Elizabeth can't believe she waited to say something.

Amelia knows Diana is his. She apologizes for letting John into their lives, but urges Elizabeth to leave town. Elizabeth thinks John will tell Charles about Diana if she tries to leave. She tells Amelia she's done listening to her and leaves.

They follow Amelia and the crystal.

Standing guard outside the room, Melissa wallows in self-pity over the fact that they're never going to have normal lives. Adam cheers her up by turning up the music and putting on mood lighting. He asks her to dance.

On the dance floor, Faye reminds Jake about him standing her up two years ago. She waited three hours. She forces him to dance. She knows he feels guilty about Nick, but she tells him the circle are the ones who didn't help him, not Jake.

Still in 1995, Amelia goes to return her crystal to Adam's grandfather. He gave her the crystal to protect herself from Blackwell. She tells him she's planning to take Cassie and leave.

Amelia confesses that Ethan is turning Blackwell over to the witch hunters right now. She says Blackwell made the six girls in her circle get pregnant. He used magic on the other four to make sure they conceived. Mr. Conant says Blackwell is building a circle for himself.

Watching, Cassie realizes her father planned them.

Mr. Conant tells Amelia he'll cloak the crystal and hide it in the trophy case in case she needs it. She tells him to tell Ethan she doesn't love him, for his own safety.

Cassie and Diana now know they're being used, but for what?

They come back to the present. Cassie acknowledges Diana was right. But that's not enough for Diana, who says she needs to apologize to the circle and that it's Cassie's fault he's in their lives at all. Diana compares Cassie's blindness to her mother Amelia's, whom Diana now blames for her mother's death. Diana runs out.

Adam and Melissa come in for a recap. After Cassie tells them Blackwell is using them, they hear a noise in the hall. It's Nick, he's going for the crystal. He rounds a corner and runs into Dawn, then blows by her.

Faye and Jake run into them and head for the trophy case. Adam is unlocking it when Nick body slams him into the case and grabs the crystal. The circle takes off after Nick.

""I knew I should have brought demon-chasing shoes,"" Faye complains.

Diana comes home to find her father huddled on the kitchen floor. He tells her all he ever wanted to do was protect her. He tells her he's done terrible things. He's freaking out and paranoid. He tells her to go upstairs and pack.

He says Amelia is haunting him because of ""what I did.""

Diana realizes he killed Cassie's mom. She runs outside into the street. Grant pulls up and hugs her. Blackwell sees the whole scene as she breaks down.

The circle, minus Diana, follows Nick to a wrecking yard. ""Why is it always spooky old dirty places with him? Why couldn't he hide in a mall or a nice hotel?"" Faye whines.

They have to find the crystal and keep it away from Blackwell.

As they're looking, Jake apologizes to Faye for bailing on prom two years ago. They follow a noise.

Cassie, Melissa and Adam see Nick meet Eben. Nick wants to trade. Cassie sees what's happening and uses dark magic to turn on the junk cars and rip the crystal out of Nick's hand. Eben uses his borrowed magic to fling Cassie through the air. He starts racing scrap cars at the circle.

Faye and Jake are unprotected as a car barrels toward them. At the last second, another cuts in its path, saving them. It's Blackwell, saying he'll deal with Eben.

Eben flips a car on top of Blackwell.

Nick finds Cassie unconscious on the ground and goes for her crystal. Jake sees his brother and tackles him with his knife. They struggle over it but Jake lets up, feeling for his brother. Nick doesn't have the same problem and starts to choke Jake, showing no signs of letting up.

Suddenly, he stops. Melissa stabbed him in the back. Nick drops to the ground, really dead this time. She tells Jake he was right, that wasn't Nick.

The rest of the circle converges as Cassie wakes up. They look for the crystal but Blackwell walks over and picks it up. Blackwell says Eben got away and took Faye. He says they can save Faye by building the skull."
