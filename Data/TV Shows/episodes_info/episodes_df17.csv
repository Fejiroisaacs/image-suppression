https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3143828/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"After surviving a terrifying night lost in a forest, four mismatched teenage boys return home to find that things aren't quite as they left them.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Daina Reid'],"['', '']",[],"['title directed by female', 'live action fantasy']",[],"Four Year 10 students - Andy, Felix, Jake and Sam - are forced to buddy up for an orienteering exercise in the rugged Bremin Ranges, on the outskirts of their hometown, Bremin. The boys are from very different friendship groups and do not really get along, so when they are expected to collaborate they are not happy. Halfway through the orienteering course, they decide to take a shortcut that very quickly gets them lost.

Andy, Felix, Jake and Sam must put aside their differences and work out how best to survive the night. As a freak lightning storm takes hold, the boys' fertile imaginations run amok. But there is really something out there. A ferocious, snarling thing stalks the boys from the undergrowth.

For Andy, a diehard nerd stifled by his family's over-protectiveness, getting lost is an opportunity to prove himself as a man of action and follow in the footsteps of his hero, Bear Grylls. Being an outsider is nothing new to Goth Felix, who is more than willing to embrace the weirdness of the situation. Alpha jock Jake uses a bullying demeanour to cover his vulnerability, while golden boy Sam - for whom nothing ever goes wrong - doesn't see the seriousness in their predicament.

The boys finally manage to make it out of the forest - alive and triumphant - with help from eccentric bushman Roland. Upon their return to Bremin, the boys discover that no one seems fazed by their disappearance. Where are their anxiously waiting families? Where are the TV crews? Something has changed.

Felix is shocked and delighted to discover that his younger brother, Oscar, is no longer wheelchair-bound, but Oscar doesn't seem to know who Felix is. The others also return to their homes and families to find that things are not as they were. Has something happened to Bremin while the boys were lost in the forest? Or has something happened to the boys?"

What proves more difficult is coming to terms with their loss of identity. It's one thing to be forgotten, but it's starting to look like they never existed.

Andy, Felix and Jake break into Bremin High searching for proof of themselves in the school records. All they find is the dismaying confirmation that no evidence exists of them ever being students there. Then the upside dawns: nonexistence means absolute freedom. To celebrate this realisation, the boys run riot in the gym, unaware of a security camera filming their destructive fun.

Meanwhile, Sam finds a romantic carving made by himself and his girlfriend, Mia, only a month before. Buoyed by what he considers to be tangible proof that he exists, Sam searches for Mia to confirm his identity. His hopes are crushed when Mia doesn't recognise him. Nevertheless, the presence of the carving gives the other boys hope that there is still some semblance of them in the world. Perhaps the effects of their 'erasure', if that's what it is, can be reversed? Jake convinces Sam to show Mia the proof in the hope that it will jog her memory.

Sam returns to Mia and shows her a photograph of the carving. When Mia reveals that she made it with her boyfriend, Sammy, Sam is stunned to find himself facing off against a smarmy younger version of himself. A desperate Sam confronts his mother, Dee, but like everyone else, she still doesn't recognise Sam at all and, worse still, suffers a violent physical reaction to him. Gutted, Sam returns to their hideout to join his new, mismatched family.

If these setbacks aren't enough, the 'thing' that stalked the boys in the forest makes a scary return."

It is a terrifying night.

When the boys emerge the next morning, they discover strange configurations of debris scattered around their hideout. Andy's search for a scientific explanation and Felix's belief that magic is at play causes conflict and the group part ways: Andy and Jake head to Lily Lau's restaurant to obtain bait to trap the panther which Andy believes has caused the markings; Felix and Sam head to Arcane Lane in search of more mystical answers.

Using Sam to distract Phoebe, Arcane Lane's mysterious proprietor, Felix discovers an old tome that identifies the hideout configurations as a demonic centrifuge. Disturbed, he buys an amulet for protection - but will it work?

Andy's ninja aspirations fall flat when he is sprung and entrapped by his hostile family while trying to pilfer the bait. Despite his best efforts, Andy fails to convince his father, that he really is his son from another dimension, brought here via a wormhole. His Grandma Lily declares Andy to be the ghost of her unborn grandson. Jake helps Andy make a hasty escape before the police are called.

Andy desperately continues to search for other possible answers, only to convince himself that he and the other boys are actually in a state of unconsciousness. Driven to test his new theory, Andy sets out in search of a stimulus powerful enough to jolt them all back into a state of consciousness. Andy decides to throw himself in front of the local school bus in an effort to ""wake up"". The other boys race to stop him in time."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402098/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,Welcome to Graceland - a prime piece of real estate that was seized from drug lords and now serves as an undercover residence for agents.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Russell Lee Fine'],"['', '']",[],"['guy wears a too small tee', 'undercover', 'hazing', 'beach', 'chore', 'swimwear', 'execution', 'drug trade', 'drinking', 'bare chested male']",[],"Welcome to ""Graceland,"" a new USA crime drama about five undercover Feds-- DEA, FBI, Customs-- picked to live in a swanky house in Manhattan Beach, CA named after the abode of Elvis Presley himself. (So dubbed because the drug dealer who previously lived there was obsessed with the King.)

We will mostly be seeing the series through the eyes of FBI newbie Mike Warren who is the newest addition to the house. He joins ringleader/senior agent Paul Briggs, fierce female FBI agent Charlie, friendly Iceman Johnny Turturro, DEA gal Paige Arkin, and seemingly menacing FBI guy DJ Jakes.

According to the show's opening scroll, the series is based on actual events that happened at a house of this kind.

We see Mike as he graduates from the academy and hears a rousing speech about walking into the battlefield of the real world. This is cross cut with a deal going down by a harbor somewhere. A drug deal happens, the man buying tests the heroin- seemingly in his arm-- but then the small piece of fruit he was using hidden in his elbow crook to inject the drugs falls out. The dealers make him for an agent and he is shot and falls to the ground. A female member of the selling team, clearly an agent, Lauren, his partner, freaks as he is shot and all parties speed away.

This was agent named Donnie, who Mike is replacing. (Donnie's not dead but he's down for the count.)

Briggs is told to pick Mike up at the airport by Gerry, the overseeing boss, but he sends Johnny so he can go surfing. (Mike has been doing immersive Spanish training on the plane.) Johnny gives him the lay of the very sexy, laid-back land. (Lots of chicks in bikinis.) He then brings him to the house. Their covers: Briggs says he's a tae bo instructor and Charlie says she's a trust fund kid.

Inside the house Johnny shows him the ""chore wheel"" and informs him wherever it says ""Donnie"" it's now his job. The phone room where all government calls are made. And then to his room which is still full of Donnie's stuff. Lauren is very grumpy with him, protective of her shot partner.

Jakes-- who is working on a bird smuggling ring-- arrives home and as Mike tries to greet him he gets angry that Mike is drinking his orange juice and ate his cereal. Briggs wakes up and Mike tells him he's honored to be training with him. He's very eager to get going. Briggs' first job for him is to have him do his chores so he can get used to the whole ""undercover"" thing. He then grabs a bottle of rum and wanders off. Mike can't believe this is the ""brilliant"" Briggs he has heard about.

Charlie, looking like a bag lady/addict stumbles around a crack house, collecting evidence and helping with a baby. She heads back to Graceland and is the next person to give Mike a hard time. When she enters he thinks she's a burglar and they face off with guns. He learns there are ""no guns downstairs.""

Donnie is in a safe house, recuperating. Lauren chats with him and tells him the Russian and Mexicans want him dead and she tells him about the ""new guy"" Mike. She tells him it's not Graceland without him and to hurry up and get well.

The next day Briggs awakes to a spotless kitchen. Mike is serious about the chore wheel. Briggs takes him for a surfing lesson. It does not go well right away. There is a lot of wiping out.

As he gets to know everyone and what they're working on, he's struck by how laid back Briggs is. Charlie says he used to be more button downed but a few years back and something happened and he took a leave and he came back all Zen-ned out. She doesn't know what.

Lauren is on a rampage to get the guys who shot Donnie, and so he gets sent on a deal with a low level dealer. On the way to his first deal he also hears tell of a convoluted cover story that involves Briggs being in an actor who sometimes plays a cop in the movies who is undercover as a male hooker called ""Sunset Bust."" It was a story he used to get out of trouble with some dealers, he even pulled out his badge and said it was a prop for the movie-- a low budget film. They decide that Mike is also in the movie, and he plays Briggs' brother-in-law.

He heads to do the deal. Of course, he immediately starts using this cover story because he is nervous. The guy doesn't have any money but Mike tries to save the op when the guy says he has merch to exchange for the drugs. He shows him a truck full of 15,000 pairs of jeans. This is not a good deal. But he makes it anyway. They arrive and arrest both of them. Except that at the police station they walk the dealer into Mike and his cover is blown.

A Russian lawyer shows up to help Felix, the guy Mike busted, and who knows he's a cop. Except that guy is not Felix's lawyer, he's a Russian mobster.

Briggs looks over Mike's file and sees that he requested a D.C. assignment and was first in his class but was given an ""emergency"" assignment at Graceland.

Mike, Charlie, Briggs, and Johnny hangs out and bond. Mike is nicknamed ""Levi."" (For the jeans.) Mike tells DJ how he got his nickname. He asks DJ about himself and the protectiveness of his OJ. DJ just says Mike got him on a bad day and turns out to be a nice dude.

Felix's lawyer tells him that he best not talk to the Feds and just in case his family will be staying with them. Felix is freaked and tells the Russian lawyer that Mike is his brother-in-law.

It turns out Felix does have a white brother-in-law. So Mike has to go back to the police department and pretend to be Felix's brother-in-law, Frankie, complete with fake scar and track marks and withdrawal symptoms. The Russians are bailing him out. Briggs says they'll get him to kill someone so they have him in the ""family."" He tells Mike to play along in order to get Felix's family free. They have a reporter that will print up a fake homicide and everyone walks away.

Mike passes the audition with the Russians thanks to quick help from the gang back at the police station. Here's the scary twist though: they want Mike to kill Donnie at the safe house. Mike and Donnie face off and discover who each other are. Mike explains it's his first day. Donnie and Mike say hi to the gang back at the police station through the wire Mike is wearing. Mike squeezes off a bunch of shots into the floor and leaves. The Russians want him to get in the car, they pull a gun, Briggs shows up and saves his ass. He kills one of the Russians claiming he saw the gun even though Mike knows he didn't. But, he does know that Briggs saved his life.

They watch the next morning as the news reports of the nabbing of the Russian mobsters. Felix gets his family back.

Briggs and Mike are debriefed and are cleared for a clean shooting. They are commended for their good work.

Later that night at a bonire with the gang and they have a toast to their success. Briggs commends Mike and says he's an undercover agent now and his ""lies are his life"" which means girls and family. Mike asks how he keeps from going crazy. Briggs says ""who says I haven't.""

Mike gets a call and here's the twist: it's the FBI boss who was speaking at Mike's graduation and his actual assignment is to investigate agent Briggs and will the fact that Briggs saved his life affect that? Mike says nope. The FBI director says if he keeps that attitude he'll make deputy director one day. Briggs comes up and says he noticed in his file that Mike asks for D.C. and got this instead. Briggs wants to know if he knows why. He claims he doesn't."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2516714/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"When ongoing investigations clash, Briggs and Mike seize the opportunity to tilt rival gangs against each other while Mike learns that undercover life comes with many moral complications.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Russell Lee Fine'],"['', '']",[],"['animal in episode title', 'dog in episode title', 'contraband', 'nightclub', 'smuggling', 'handcuffs', 'therapy', 'beach', 'bare chested male']",[],"Briggs and Mike take a walk down the boardwalk and Briggs tells Mike to figure out wh he is in this new world. He's just known as Paul, a dude who digs motorcycles, rum, and tae bo.

They hook up with Johnny and head to Hector's taco food truck. While there a kid robs the food truck and decks Hector and Mike takes off after him. Briggs tells Johnny to stop him. They try to point out to him that he's undercover and he can't go chasing petty criminals in the place where they live, he'll blow his cover.

The next morning he awakes at six and makes his bed like a good boy scout and drinks his OJ and works on his grip strength and heads for a run on the beach while listening to his Spanish-language lesson tapes. He runs past Charlie doing the walk of shame. At breakfast Charlie says she was cultivating an informant who likes Jagermeister. Jakes says he has to go work on his bird smuggling case. Mike promises not to try to make a mistake like yesterday again.

Johnny opens the mail. Mike has to go to a psych eval in the wake of the Russian mobster shooting. He also gets a case, working with Briggs but Briggs thinks he's too green to be squeezed onto one of Briggs' cases. He argues to be put on the case of a drug and gun runner named Bello. Briggs wants to give him a case with ""training wheels.""

Jakes, pretending to be Jamaican goes to get a shipment of illegal birds. The ""order"" is screwed up. The guys he's meeting with trap him in the back of the truck and he calls a team to rescue him. They pull a crate out of the back of the truck behind the birds and it's full of ""cop-killer"" bullets.''

Back at Graceland, Lauren is taking down photos from the Russian mob case. She's been pulled from the case and she told them that she has to go back to the Ukraine to care for her sick mother. Briggs tells her that Donnie, her partner, is not coming back. Briggs tells her to let Donnie go. She doesn't want to let him go.

Mike heads down to the FBI office to see Dr. Juan Badillo for his ""psych eval."" They talk about what got him hooked to the FBI. His grandfather was a crime scene photographer. Mike wants to fight evil. The doctor asks if he's disappointed in being assigned undercover to Graceland instead of D.C. like he wanted. He said he was disappointed at first but he loves the house and the agents. He calls Briggs ""complicated."" Mike realizes that Badillo is not a shrink and he's actually there as his ""control officer"" to talk about his investigation of Briggs. Mike wants to know why he's investigating. Badillo says for now he just needs to get close to him and that if they help him with Briggs he can write his own ticket out of Graceland and back to D.C and the fast track. He says it won't be easy. Badillo says that's why they chose Mike.

Mike confides in Charlie that he wants to be on the Bello case. Charlie says Mike has to charm him and bring him something. They need to offer Bello something that will make a splash. Mike gets it in his head to offer the way illegal bullets that Jakes discovered. In the meantime, she asks him for a favor back. She needs him for a covert op. They head to their ""undercover closet"" full of various wardrobe and make-up to dress him up as her tough boyfriend.

They head to a karaoke bar to meet up with Paige, who is onstage singing. Mike starts drooling over her. Paige is pretending to be a bad guy's girlfriend. They all head to ladies room. Paige jokingly calls him Levi as Charlie works on crushing birth control pills into the bad guy Bobby's drink. Apparently, this will keep him from getting an erection. It works and he's embarrassed and kicks Paige out. She doesn't like the case because Bobby won't talk business in front of her. Briggs says he has a connection with Bobby's crew and will try to help.

Mike offers the cop killer bullets to Briggs to offer to Bello. He says he'll pretend to be a Marine, fake sell the bullets to Bello's lieutenant, arrest him and flip him. Briggs says he'll think about it. He does, and decides it's a go. Jakes doesn't want to give up the bullets because it could come back to haunt him. He trades Mike for two turns on the chore wheel.

They set up the op and meet with Bello's lieutenant Eddie. They test out the bullets on teddy bears with cop body armor on them. But they're bad shots and Mike goes alpha on them. He takes the gun from Eddie and points out the bullets are longer and heavier then they're used to and they need to aim just under their targets. He blows the bears away and makes his point. Eddie is impressed and they make a deal which means they will finally be able to meet Bello. They have made a sufficient splash and are bringing him something he wants.

Over a bonfire on the beach, Johnny dramatically tells the tale of gunslinger Mike to the other agents and pretends to shoot them all. Briggs seriously congratulates Mike. He asks over his psych eval. Mike says it was standard stuff but he's going to make it a weekly visit. Briggs seems a little suspicious of this. They toast their merry band of misfits.

The next day they go to make the sale. They get the money and the bad guys take off. Mike is confused as to why they're not arresting them since that was a plan. Briggs says that was Mike's plan. Mike is freaked out that the cop killer bullets will now be on the streets. Briggs has a plan. They stop for hot dogs and Mike is confused. Mike calls and leaves a message with Badillo. He goes back with the hot dogs. Briggs asks if he trusts him. Mike says no. Briggs tries to explain that he's been in with these guys for awhile so he knows that Eddie always makes the same getaway plan and that he will be in this spot in no time. The bad guys show up and are intercepted while what seems like other bad guys. They are Paige's guys with Bobby. This is how Briggs is helping her. Bringing Bobby something. Mike asks now what? Briggs says they are going to buy their bullets back with the money they just got from Eddie from selling the bullets. They then arrest Bobby (and Briggs and Mike.) Pretty ingenius. Mike asks why Briggs didn't tell him about the plan. Briggs notes when he asked if he trusted him, Mike said no and asks if who he called at the food truck. Mike says he was just checking messages. Briggs wondered if he was tempted to call into the bureau on the plan. He says he was tempted but he didn't. Briggs noted if he had he would've crashed the whole plan. Briggs notes this would've been bad. Mike says anything could've gone wrong. Briggs notes that it didn't, they busted Bobby and got closer to Bello and it was a good day and their side won.

Mike goes to see Badillo and tells him he can't underestimate Briggs. Badillo pumps him up and says he's smarter than Briggs and to work it out.

Briggs and Mike go to meet Bello in a suitably creepy industrial/warehouse environment. Briggs comes up behind Mike and puts a gun to his head and says ""who have you been talking to?"""
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2545780/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,Briggs calls on the house to help Lauren with her case against the Russian Mafia and Charlie gets into some hot water when her C.I. proves unreliable during a dangerous drug deal.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Renny Harlin'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"We pick up right where we left off with Briggs pointing a gun at Mike's head asking ""who you been talking to?"" He disarms Mike. It's a set-up. The lights flicker on and Bello and his crew emerge asking why Briggs is pulling his gun on his own man.

Briggs explains that since Bello's bullets got jacked by Bobby and then Bello requested a meeting with them and when they showed up he could make out Bello's men pointing guns at them he did the math: Bello thinks they sold him out and the only new face around here is Mike's so it must've been him. Bello praises his quick thinking while Mike protests that he didn't say anything to anyone. He throws the suspicion on Bello's lieutenant Eddie, who always did the same ""heat run""-- tricky getaway moves-- every time. It's clear they plan to torture the guy but Bello believes them and welcomes them with open arms. They're in with the boss.

On the ride home they exult in the adrenaline rush of playing the game. Briggs is proud of him and tells him to stand up and scream his lungs out and he does and feels good. Mike admits he was afraid Briggs was going to kill him and he was just making it up as he went along. Briggs says he rocked it.

They debrief over drinks at Graceland with Johnny, Charlie, Paige, and DJ.

Lauren goes to confer with Briggs about the Russian mob job. Donnie was transferred to Miami. She thinks if she takes down another member of the mob Donnie can come back. She tells Briggs the Russian mobster has something in the works for the next day and they try to work out a plan. Briggs bring in the other FBI folks, Johnny and Mike. It's a car thieving job.

Mike tells Badillo about Bello and Briggs pulling the gun on him. He asks again why he's investigating Briggs. They think he might be skimming cash. Badillo asks for more details in the future.

Charlie goes to see her informant Whistler, a meth head. He's working on a dollhouse or his niece. She wants to know what's up. He has a score for her, a drug dealer who's desperate and he wants to help Charlie get him off the street. He claims he's not high. She tells him to set up the job. He asks for his usual 20 percent ahead of time and he needs the money now because he's getting kicked out. She denies him and tells him to stay out of trouble.

They set up on the highway with spike strips to catch the truck with the cars. They realize the truck is running too light to have the cars and hey kill the mission. Lauren runs into the road to stop the truck, identifying herself as a DEA agent, convinced there is something on it thereby screwing up the mission. The truck is empty. Briggs tells her she's done since the mob driver has now seen her face. She claims she can fix it. He tells her it's over.

Mike and Johnny and tell DJ and Paige about what went down over lunch and beers. They talk to Mike about how he can never break his cover. They can't speak freely because one of Paige's guys she's working on is on the bar. She told him she's a pharmaceutical rep. Johnny is always either a pilot of a photographer. DJ plays bass in a band that no one has ever heard of.

Paige goes back to see her mob buddy. He tells her about the DEA/FBI stop. He says the job is not off. The guy's driver is right in the other room. He sees Paige leave and all he can say is ""nice ass. He doesn't see her face.

Mike tries to work a woman as a aspiring pro golfer and Briggs comes in and the woman Mike is hitting on skedaddles because she thinks Briggs is an astronaut, who she blew off.

Mike goes back to the table and joins them. He leans on Briggs' credit card on the table, gets the imprint of the number on his hand and takes a picture of it.

Charlie and Whistler meet with the drug dealer who is impressed with their stuff. Charlie asks to see the money and then Whistler messes thing up by asking for more money. Charlie tries to override him and says let's do this. The bust goes down. Charlie and Whistler play the game yelling at each other ""you set me up."" As they're arrested, Charlie berates him for the rogue move.

Lauren comes home with a black eye. She tells him the Russian mobster did it because he caught her sniffing around. She apologizes but says she had to know she wasn't crazy She saw the Lojacked cars in the warehouse so they have their evidence.

Charlie goes to see Whistler and tells her she can't use him as an informant anymore because he's too risky. She tells him to get his life together. He is desperate and tells her he's screwed. She says he's getting a check for $100,000 and wonders how that's screwed. He asks what he will do without her. She tells him he needs to grow up and will get his check tomorrow. He asks if she at least fought for him. She says she did.

Everybody goes to hit the Russian mob warehouse and get the cars. They blow the door and a firefight ensues. There are way more guys then expected. They overtake them and arrest Lauren's Russian mobster. They pull him aside and Briggs ""talks"" to him. Giving him payback for punching Lauren. When he notices his knuckles are clean, he realizes Lauren played him, saying the mobster hit her to make the job happen.

Later they toast at the bar. Johnny shows off his scar from the fight. Lauren opted out of the party.

Paige tries to get Mike to hit on a girl at the bar Mike says he's not up for it. Says Paige goes to talk to the girl on his behalf. Her name is Abby. While they chat some people hit on Paige and Charlie and Briggs decides to literally hit on them. He works out his aggression from the job.

Paige and Briggs work out that Lauren's story doesn't add up and realize that if the Russians put Lojacks on the cars they stole they could put one on her and if so she's leading the, now angry, Russians back to Graceland.

Apparently, Mike and Abby spent the night talking as they walk along the beach the next morning. She's an aspiring lawyer about to take the bar. She's spending the summer in California for her last gasp of freedom. She says Paige told her at the bar that of all the guys there Mike was the most ""real."" Abby asks if Mike is ""real."" They kiss.

He heads home and Paige buttonholes him to go work something out. To do this they play Frisbee on the beach. They pretend to lose it under a car, Lauren's. They find the Lojack.

Charlie drives Whistler to a house and says it can be his. It's a serious fixer-upper but he's a great carpenter and they both know he can fix it. They walk through it and he can already envision what he would do with it. She gives him the realtor number and the check and she tells him to call him, give him the check, and the house will be his.

Lauren comes home angry saying she is being kicked out of Graceland. Briggs says it was a self-inflicted wound like everything else going on here. He says he knows she liked to him and almost got Johnny killed and put the whole house in harm's way. He is livid that she played him. She says she did it for Donnie and she had to do something. He points out that she had to get him to do something. He says all is not lost,she's still DEA and if she puts in for a transfer she may just get Miami and there will be an agent there happy to see her. Briggs, always with the plan.

Mike sends Briggs' credit card number through the system to look through his purchases. He flags a purchase at an auto parts store. He heads over there and shows him Briggs' picture and what he bought, a GPS tracker. Like the one on Lauren's car. Mike figures it out and goes to Briggs with his ""theory"" that someone else put the tracker on Lauren's Jeep. Briggs admits that he did it because she endangered them all. He says if Mike is going to be good at this job there has to be dispassion except when it comes to protecting Graceland. He says he would do it to Mike.

Charlie drives by the house she showed to Whistler and a Hispanic family has apparently bought it."

It's amazing weed and so she knows that there are bigger fish swimming around.

Charlie tells a story about her great, great grandmother saving a fugitive in Naples and they fell in love and kept their famous Ragu recipe in the family. She is making it for the house for ""sauce night"" and says it will be ready in three days.

Mike is texting with Abby and is busted by Johnny and Charlie. He claims she's not his girlfriend and knows he can't date. Charlie says they can date they just can't get too close.

Briggs and Mike set up a new meeting with Bello, SoCal's primary heroin supplier.

Paige shows Charlie and DJ the weed and they think that some of the legally allowed pot farms grow more than necessary and then flood the market with the extra for a little cash on the side. Paige wants to set up a meeting with the dispensary dealer, who once had a big crush on DJ. But he can't set up a meet with her as an undercover dealer since his cover with her was someone with ties to Latino gangbangers so they decide to send Johnny instead since he's Mexican. Charlie covers him with convincing (airbrushed) gang tattoos.

Briggs and Mike go to meet with Bello, who did a number on his right hand man in the last episode when he thought he betrayed him. Bello only wants to talk to Mike, who sits down with him a restaurant. His cover remains that he's a Marine. After his impressive marksmanship the last time they met, Bello wants Mike to teach his men how to shoot. When Mike doesn't recognize the phrase ""WQB"" at first they get suspicious of him but then he remembers the nickname for the phrase was ""pizza box."" This gets Bello off his back, and the gun out of his gut. Mike says he's in.

Charlie is still at work on her sauce. (It takes three days.) Briggs enters and informs her that Mike is now sitting down with Bello, a guy Paul has been chasing for years. He's both jealous and worried. Charlie says he has ""quarterback syndrome,"" that he thinks his team mates can't win without him. She tells him to focus on getting the championship as opposed to the credit.

DJ and Johnny go to meet the weed dispensary lady, who may have had a crush on him, but also was a hardcore criminal and murderer. DJ wants to get the job done quick and easy. She gives him a big hug and asks Johnny his story. He pulls a bunch of character-appropriate attitude and walks away almost blowing the whole deal. DJ asks her to give him another shot and promises Johnny will behave. She invites them out to the farm the next day to see if they can make a deal.

Mike is going through the Bello files and he tells Briggs he wants to get him back on the case. Briggs pumps him up. Mike says he was told to ""pretend"" to train Bello's men. Given that Bello burned out his associate's eyeball, Mike doesn't think ""pretend"" training is going to work. Briggs promises to call HQ and assure them that they're in control and Mike needs to be serious.

The next day he heads out to train the men while the Graceland gang and other back-up listens in nearby. His men are former gangbangers and drug runners who competed with Bello. He essentially forced them to join him or face the alternative.

Mike begins the training with assembly and shows off his own skills. Bello tells him men to follow Mike's instructions.

Meanwhile, Johnny and DJ head to the pot farm with Paige and a back-up team following behind. The weed lady shows her the farm, it's not all weed, some of it is vegetables. She grows the weed in the barn. She continues to hit on DJ and they reminisce about old days. They talk about fireflies. DJ is anxious to see the harvest. She says she can't show them until the morning. She says she made them come to see if Johnny would grow on her. Johnny starts to flirt with her and she responds, seemingly. Paige is listening in and doesn't think weed lady is going to make the deal and wants to call it off. DJ says he has somewhere to be. Johnny says he can stay. Johnny thinks he's not only going to get laid but is going to make the deal happen. DJ says she's dangerous, Johnny counters that he's dangerous.

Mike calls Abby and apologizes for not calling lately. She's out with friends. He asks her out to dinner for the next night. But then he remembers Charlie's Ragu sauce and offers to take her to drinks instead. He is then jumped by Eddie, Bello's right hand man who is missing an eye. He's suspicious of Mike and he wants to know who he is. Mike disarms him, rather easily, and dismantles the gun to boot and tells him to never bother him again.

Mike made a heat run back to the house and Charlie and Briggs want to bring him in, since Eddie's a liability. It will make it look like Eddie is in fact betraying Bello. They have Paige pretend to be Bobby Moy's girlfriend again and Charlie tells Eddie that the rumor is he gave up the bullets. They leak word to Bello that Eddie is selling him out. Charlie offers him a bus ticket to Flagstaff. Eddie knows he's being set up but he takes the ticket because he knows his death warrant has been punched. Mike is upset about this but Briggs points out that Eddie punched his own ticket when he signed on two work with a criminal mastermind who pours hot lead in people's eyes.

Johnny wakes up and shakes the weed lady off of him. Unfortunately, when they ere sexing it up the night before he also smudged off a bunch of his fake tattoos on her sheets. He goes to the barn and starts taking pictures right around the time she wakes up and notices the black ink on her sheets. She confronts him with two men in the barn, all three with guns drawn on Johnny. Paige and DJ arrive and when he goes to check out the house he is dragged into the barn by one of the gunmen. The weed lady is very angry, assuming DJ has flipped. But when she finds his walkie talkie she realizes he's a cop. But before anything can happen, Paige barrels into the barn with the truck and hops out, quickly dispatching one of the men. The weed lady grabs DJ as a human shield and tells Paige to drop her weapon or she'll kill him. Paige drops her gun but as the weed lady is distracted, Johnny whacks her in the head with a nearby bucket, saving the day.

Back at the house, everyone enjoys Charlie's Ragu. Briggs gives Mike his blessing for going on the date with Abby. But then, of course, that's when Bello texts Mike and says he wants to see him and keep training. Bello wants to speed things up and use a human target. They drag out a bloodied and bowed Eddie. Eddie claims Mike is working with the Feds who made up the story about Bobby Moy and that even though he was going to flee he didn't tell the Feds anything. Bello asks Mike if he's working with the FBI. Mike says no. BEllo asks for Mike's gun. Eddie tells Mike he's going to take his eye. Bello says this is going to end one of two ways. He hands Mike's gun to Eddie and whispers in his ear. Eddie cries, trains the gun on Mike and then reverses and puts the gun in his own mouth and pulls the trigger. At first Briggs and the back up team think it's Mike and starts to move out, but then he says something to alert them he is still alive. Mike is, justifiably, freaked out.

He then goes to meet Abby at the bar. He is dazed and out of sorts. He says he saw an accident in which someone died. She sweetly tells him to go home saying he won't be good company. He heads home and all the sauce is gone and it's his turn to do the dishes. He is shaken. Briggs enters and offers to give him a hand with the dishes. He also notes Charlie left him a plate. Mike says he wants to be alone and tells Briggs to eat it since he missed ""sauce night"" too. Briggs tells him '""it's just sauce."""

Mike is still feeling depressed after watching Bello's man kill himself so Johnny and Paige drag him to the beach for a little touch football to cheer him up.

When they return Mike is stunned to see Charlie and Briggs ""shooting up."" But of course, it turns out they're just practicing for an undercover job. They use hemoglobin which is safe. Everyone advises that Charlie should exhibit a little more ""O-Mouth"" when she is pretending to have the high hit her.

Briggs and Charlie pretend to be a couple-- Katie and Eric-- and go to meet with their guy Quinn. They are using him to get to a higher up named Odin. (We also learn that Briggs and Charlie actually once really did get it on.) But as they are finishing up making plans to meet the big man, Charlie's former informant Whistler shows up. (The one who bailed on buying the house and getting clean after she cut him loose.) Charlie hops on Briggs' lap and starts making out with him so Whistler won't see their faces and blow their cover.

Mike goes to his handler Badillo and again asks why he's investigating Briggs who, although clearly unconventional, appears to get the job done and sincerely care about both his fellow Graceland housemates and pursuing justice. Badillo says there are good reasons. Mike says he's earned the right to know them. (If he tells them we don't see it.)

When they get home, Charlie is worried that Whistler made them. Briggs tries to reassure her and then tells her just to suss him out. She tells him she's done with Whistler. As they talk Paige and Johnny discuss whether Charlie and Briggs are about to hook up again. She bets it will, he says no. Loser pays the winner's bar tab for a week.

Mike runs into Abby at the bar. He mentions to Johnny that he never told her a cover job. He goes to chat with her. Johnny told her that Mike was a pilot. Mike goes with it.

Charlie goes to see Whistler and says she was worried about him. He swears to her that he's clean. She buys him a warm shirt. He thinks she wants to start using him for cases again but she says she just wants to make sure he's okay. She calls Briggs and says they're good and learns that they're on to meet Odin.

Mike walks with Abby on the beach. They run into Mike's beach dog and Abby suggests getting him a bath. He goes back home and Paige and Johnny give him a hard time that Abby wants to fix him and tame him. Mike thinks they're wrong.

Mike meets with Badillo who shows him a report that seems to speculate that they get less drugs than they expect to net from his busts and they think he's reselling the drugs to fund his rainy day account or trading it for intel. Mike suggests bringing him on Bello as a test almost since he has the potential to bring in an insane amount of drugs. Or steal them, notes Badillo.

Mike continues to train Bello's men and tells them that they need a few more months, Bello doesn't want it to take that long.

Mike goes to Briggs to talk about getting closer to Bello's drug dealings. Briggs tells him to take his time and work his cover. Mike wants to speed things up. Briggs tells him to offer to be his new bodyguard. Mike also discovers that Bello digs old westerns and hopes to use this to his advantage.

Briggs and Charlie go to meet with Quinn at an airport hotel. Quinn is running late so they get cozy and chat about the time that they hooked up. She calls them young, crazy kids.

Quinn shows up and is annoyed that Johnny is the valet, claiming he knows all the valets and he leaves, too paranoid to go in to the hotel.

Charlie and Briggs realize they're in a holding pattern and order room service. Charlie says she told him why she hooked up with him because he was a myth and wants to know why he hooked up with her. He says she is hot, beautiful, smart, kind and they agree the sex was mind-blowing. So they decide to have some more, much to Johnny's chagrin, who is listening in until Briggs turned off his watch. They come close to doing it but think better of it. But then they turn on some porn and turn on the watch again to make Johnny believe they did it so Paige will win the bet.

Mike meets with Bello who asks which of his men has the most potential. He tells them they're all a little skittish since Eddie's death. They chat about the movie and this seems to endear him to Bello. They go to a store to get more movies with the actor from the film Bello likes. He talks about how he likes this guy in particular because he's a cowboy who fights for himself. They get into an altercation with an employee and Mike shows his loyalty to Bello.

They go to Bello's and watch the movie. Bello says Mike impressed him. Mike offers to be his bodyguard. Bello says he likes him and likens him to one of the characters in the film and accepts his offer. Bello asks about what Mike is willing to do, to drive him, to jump at a moment's notice. Bello takes a call and Mike snoop around Bello's office, gawking at his calendar. He gets back to his seat in the nick of time.

Mike reports to Briggs that he's gotten closer to Bello. He tells him about seeing the name ""Bigfoot"" on Bello's calendar. It's a code name for bringing drugs in by submarine. Briggs is impressed with him.

Johnny confronts Briggs and Charlie and they pretend that leaving the wire on was an invitation to him. Johnny gets all weirded out as they come on to him. They come clean and have a good laugh. They realize they need to use Whistler to salvage their deal with Quinn.

She goes to Whistler and sets it up. He calls her wasted and tells her it's all set and to come over now. He passes out while talking to her.

Mike meets with Abby who got the dog all cleaned him up and took him to the vet. They release him back on the beach. He relishes telling Paige and Johnny that she let the dog go and doesn't want to tame him either.

Briggs and Charlie head to Quinn's. They discover Whistler is dead. When Quinn calls them out on not using his stuff-- saying this is what undercover cops do, since they are not allowed to actually take drugs-- Briggs tries to abort the deal. But Charlie, smarting from losing Whistler, takes Quinn's drugs and actually shoots herself up. There is sufficient ""O-Mouth"" when the drugs hit her."

After her using to prove she wasn't a cop in front of the dealer Odin, Charlie is a wreck. She apologizes profusely to Briggs, who brings her provisions to a safe room. She doesn't remember much, other than feeling great after shooting up and Briggs pulling her out. She feels like Whistler died for nothing and she blew it. He tells her the only thing she needs to worry about is getting better and says she'll be sick for a few days. She's at one of his CI's apartments. She tearfully says she wants to go home. He says she can't go back to Graceland because if the bureau catches wind of it she will be done and that he brought her there to save her career and that it will be their secret. She thanks him.

A group of Feds led by Johnny nabs a sub running drugs. Johnny and Paige head for the sub, mindful of booby traps. Johnny doesn't find anything, no drugs at all. But they're glad they're taking the sub out of commission anyway.

Mike is now ensconced as Bello's bodyguard. Bello's buddies are mad about the sub bust. He tells Mike that the drugs are actually in a torpedo which the guys on the sub let loose when they're caught. Mike suggests that he and Bello go and find the sub themselves and cut the cartel out and make the 20 million dollar payday. Bello tells him not to get too big for his britches. Mike says he knows a guy that could help them find it. Bello is listening.

Briggs and Johnny give Mike a hard time about boning up on westerns to get in with Bello. They heard his plan on the wire and they liked the idea but are angry that he improvised in the moment. Johnny suggests he be their fake ""guy who knows something about subs."" He's going to pretend to be a SEAL. Briggs reminds him that vouching for someone in Bello's world carries consequences. Mike claims he's not worried.

Mike brings his plan to Badillo, who likes it because it's busting both a dealer and putting the drugs on a silver platter for Briggs to steal if he's dirty. Mike asks if this will get him back to D.C. Badillo says it's not about how fast he gets back but getting back in one piece.

Charlie is toughing it out at the safe house, throwing up and sweating. She notices a locked door. Johnny calls her and she says she's still sad about Whistler. She says she's on a case in Fontana. She tells him she's fine. Johnny reports that he and Charlie have to come in and give their side of the Odin debacle the next a.m. at 9. She doesn't think she can make it but tells him she'll see him. She realizes she's between a rock and a hard place.

Mike has a date with Abby. She wants to go to his place but he says his room mates are messy. She feels like he's hiding them from her and says she wants to hang out, at least with Paige since she owes her an apology for introducing her to Mike. He says okay.

Briggs brings Charlie her clothes but is worried they'll be able to tell. She begs him for a solution. He offers her one in the form of ""hair of the dog."" She thinks he's crazy to have her go in there high. He promises it will get her through and then they can get the junk out of her system. What's scaring her is she actually wants it. He loads it up and says she doesn't have to do it. She does it. He says ""welcome back.""

Mike introduces Johnny the ""SEAL"" to Bello. (Johnny explains that the came close to becoming a SEAL but couldn't hack the SEA part and ended up being shipped to Iraq instead.) Bello is skeptical. Johnny plays the part and keeps saying things are classified. Johnny says he's not interested and takes off and Bello relents and tells him the story but says they don't have a transponder frequency to go on but other people looking for it do. He negotiates a fee of $20,000. He explains his plans to find it and says he's on the case.

Briggs takes Charlie to meet her boss with Johnny. Briggs says she looks okay but tells her to be careful as he's coming down, not to fidget, etc. She sasses that she knows about playing a cover.

Charlie and Johnny meet with the boss. She's a little argumentative but seems straight enough. She does starts to fidget a bit. Johnny comes to her defense and takes the blame. Charlie tries to argue this since it goes on Johnny's record but he takes the hit, and also takes her fidgeting hand under the table. He knows.

They go to lunch and she spills. He is upset that she was high during the evaluation. She says whatever it takes to save her career. Johnny knows Briggs knows and he tells her he doesn't care about anything he just wants her to come home and help her get better. He tells her he loves her. She says she loves him too.

Mike and Abby hang with Paige and a random dude at the Drop. Paige claims she's a spin instructor. Her date is a deejay. The guy is her ""case,"" a drug dealer. Mike is not happy and lets Paige know. Mike tells her that Abby thinks this is a real date. She says ""real"" dates are not possible with what they do.

As Abby and Mike leave she tells him that the deejay is a drug dealer. He wonders if they should tell Paige. She thinks Paige knows since she acts different around him. She says she would never do that and hopes he wouldn't either. He says he acts different: better.

Johnny and Briggs debrief on the Bello situation, with the help of the military actually tracking the torpedo. Johnny confronts him about Charlie. Briggs says he told her he wouldn't and what's done is done.

Briggs and Johnny go to get familiar with ""Johnny's boat"" and talk more about the Charlie situation. Briggs explains he had to do something. Johnny notes he covered for them both. They find the torpedo, it's booby-trapped. Briggs wants to abort, Johnny says he can defuse it. Briggs says he doesn't need to be a hero. Johnny says he is a hero.

The next day he wetsuits up. Bello asks if he's sure it's there. If it isn't Johnny says he'll give Bello 20 grand. He heads down. He reports back that he sees the torpedo. Bello tells him to hurry. Bello has one of his guys train a gun on the surfacing Johnny. He says they have to kill him because he'll talk with his drinking buddies. Bello calls it his final classified mission. Briggs hears all of that and tells Johnny to tell them that the torpedo is booby-trapped to buy time. Bello offers him Johnny's share. Mike says it's his friend. Bello says he is his friend now. Mike says he wants to do it if it's going to be done. Bello begins musing about what he's going to call his new boat. Suddenly, an explosion rocks the surface. Bello grabs Mike and screams in his face about how much money he just cost him by Johnny screwing up and asks why he shouldn't send Mike down there too. Mike say she was about to shoot his friend for him, for goodness sakes. Bello apologizes saying he lost his head and expresses condolences for Mike's loss. They motor away in the boat.

Briggs heads back to the office and calls Briggs in a panic asking where he is. He then sees Johnny, totally relieved, hugging him hard. Johnny is touched and tells him they knew about the bomb and can't believe Briggs didn't tell him. Briggs enters and Mike punches him. Briggs says he called an audible and they won so he needs to calm down. Johnny simply detached the explosive from the torpedo and set it off to fool Bello...and Mike. Mike notes he was about to waste everyone on the boat. Good thing he didn't.

They pull out the drugs and Johnny notes that they could've packed in at least twice as much which raises Mike's antenna, wondering why they didn't (and if some is missing.) Briggs says it's the biggest haul he's ever seen. Mike wants to bust Bello now for intent but Briggs wants to let it play out a little while longer. Johnny notes that Briggs had possession of the drugs between the mission and arriving at the office. Mike watches him leave with a bag and follows him to a rundown apartment building. It turns out it's an NA meeting. He sees Mike in the doorway and says to the group, and Mike, ""Hi my name is Paul and I'm a heroin addict.""

Johnny welcomes Charlie home and says he's going to take care of her. She promises she won't be shooting up in an alley and to shoot her if she does. He says he's glad to have her back."

We pick up right where we left off, at the 12-step meeting where Briggs announces that he's a heroin addict. Mike enters the room and eyes the bag that Briggs brought with him as he speaks about telling the truth.

At the end of the meeting Briggs unpacks the bag and it's a new coffee maker for the meetings. He and Mike take a walk by the beach. Briggs explains his story which we see in flashbacks.

A few years back he was working undercover in San Diego on a cartel. He was young, ambitious and in love. (He won't say who the girl is.) His training officer Umberto had worked his way into the cartel family. They found a dead body of a potential dealer that was mutilated. The killer wasn't found and Briggs was pulled off the case but Umberto stayed. Briggs went to Mexico alone against orders. But when he got there he was attacked and never discovered who turned on him. He says going there was the dumbest thing he's ever done.

He was captured and tortured by the man that mutilated the bodies code name ""Jangles"" for the keys around his waist. They shot him up with heroin and he gave it to him every day. They didn't ask him for any information. It lasted two weeks. He admits that it felt good. Then they stopped and abandoned him in the desert. He doesn't know why they did it and then let him go. He figured they did it as a way to stick it to the bureau but he kept it to himself and no one knows but him, the support group, the cartel and now Mike. He says he's been clean for awhile. Mike asks what they do now. Briggs says it's time to go home. ""Just like that?"" asks Mike. Briggs says Mike will either tell or he won't but all Briggs can do is keep moving forward.

Meanwhile at Graceland Charlie is feeling better as Johnny takes care of her. He wants her to sleep it off but she wants to work on arresting Odin. Johnny wants to do it. Charlie says she shot heroin twice and won't do it again. Johnny asks what it was like and asks if he tried it would he understand. She says he would. She insists on going back to work.

Jakes is working on a case of toy robots that were used as drug mules. Johnny wants to give one to his cousin. Jakes calls him cheap.

Mike and Briggs come home and claim they were driving Bello around all night.

Later, Mike walks in on Bello's drug operation. They are trying to stretch their supply by cutting it with a dangerous chemical since their supply is down since the loss of the torpedo. Mike challenges him on cutting the drugs, Bello takes issue with this and tells him to be careful since it was his fault they lost the torpedo so cutting the drugs is really his fault.

Mike meets with Badillo and tells him the torpedo tell and that it was impossible to tell if Briggs was stealing drugs. Mike wonders aloud if Briggs is actually doing this. Badillo claims he would be happy to hear that Briggs isn't a criminal. Badillo gives him a gift, it's a crime scene photo that Mike's grandfather took. He caught himself in the reflection. Badillo knows it's hard being away from family and thought he'd want a piece of him.

Johnny and Page and Mike and Abby meet at the bar for a hang. She has to go but she has Johnny snap a photo of them on her phone. Then Paige pockets the phone because it's dangerous for her to have a pic of an undercover agent. Mike is mad. They tell him to break up with her, to say his ""ex"" came back into the picture. He doesn't want to lie. Paige notes that he's been lying to her since day one.

Jakes goes to see his ex Cassandra and drop off a robot for his son. She says he can't give it to him. He knows. She points out that he wanted it this way and that Daniel doesn't even know him as his father. He gives her the robot to give to him. Jakes is sad.

Charlie goes to see a low level dealer and pretends to want to buy the good stuff that Odin had. She goes to see several dealers many who claim they've seen him, but none really know the guy.

Mike and Briggs throw around a ball in the living room and Mike is making the case for arresting Bello now. Briggs says they don't have enough info on the guy to bring down all those around him. Charlie comes in with her lack of info. Briggs strikes on the idea of having Bello -- who needs drugs-- to reach out to find Odin via Briggs to draw Odin out and get them both.

Mike brings the proposal to Bello, to choose a new supplier even though that means double-crossing the cartel. Bello says Briggs has 24 hours to set up a meeting or they'll hit the streets to hold up low level thugs and steal their drugs.

Briggs goes to talk to the dealers that Charlie went to to find Odin. Using Bello's name doesn't seem to be helping.

Paige shows Mike how to handle heroin and its works while Jakes works on a new CI with regards to the drug smuggling robots.

Briggs returns home and says he's succeded in setting up a meet with Bello and Odin. Charlie and Briggs talk about keeping secrets. She wants to tell the house. Briggs says she should keep it to herself. Instead she tells them. Johnny looks uncomfortable and admits he knew but it wasn't his place to say. Mike consoles her. Briggs is unhappy with the confession. Jakes hugs her.

Mike and Paige decompress about Charlie. Paige is DEA and says every day from now on she'll be checking Charlie, they have to watch each other's backs. Mike wonders what would happen if one of them truly became addicted. Paige says they'd help each other but that an addict can never be trusted.

Jakes is at a bar and he strikes up a conversation with his potential new CI. They chat about their gang tattoos. Jakes claims he had his removed. The guy got out after getting shot in a drive-by and surviving, it was a miracle. They share a whiskey and a chat. The guy says he fell for his nurse and moved her to be with her and her kid. And then we realize that this is the guy Cassandra is dating and that he is not trying to make him a CI at all. He shows Jakes a picture of his kid with pride and notes that the ""real"" father never comes up. The guy leaves. Jakes is sad. (This is a very ""Jakes is sad"" episode.)

Charlie chats with Briggs who is mad at her. She asks what his problem is. He says now if anyone ever asks from the bureau if anyone in the house has done drugs, the others will have to lie, she gave them no choice. He says her secrets are her burden and his his and they should leave it at that.

Mike and Badillo meet and rats out Briggs going to a NA meeting and says he doesn't know if he's currently using but he's trying to get better and he tells the story about the cartel. He wants Badillo to help him because he thinks Briggs is a great agent and he deserves it. Badillo says they'll help him. He tells Mike to write it up. Badillo assures him that if this means that his investigation to Briggs is over he'll go back to the East Coast.

Jakes comes home a little drunk and talks to Mike about breaking up with Abby. Mike asks for advice. Jakes says to stay with her. He notes that everyone sees Graceland differently. Briggs see it as his castle, Charlie as her family. Jakes sees it as ""just a damn house."" Mike says he hears that. Jakes tells him to find a way to keep Abby from finding out and to remember that Mike won't be living there forever.

Abby and Mike meet on a beach and she complains about her ruined phone being found at lost and found. He asks if she's excited to get back to her life on the east coast. She says if he wants to break up with her since the summer will be over soon he just should. He says he might be headed back to the east coast too and he doesn't want to break up with her. They kiss.

Briggs waits on the pier for his meet-up. Bello arrives. Paige, Mike, and Johnny listen/watch nearby. Charlie sits on a bench nearby texting. They pick out people from the crowd and bet on who it might be. Bello asks why Briggs wasn't able to deliver Odin. Paul says ""who says I wasn't?"" He clasps Bello's hand and give shim a packet of drugs. He claims he is Odin. (The others can't hear this conversation.) Bello and Briggs walk down the pier and he tells him that Mike doesn't know and the only ones who need to know are Bello and Odin/Briggs. And if that changes Briggs/Odin is out. He tells Bello he can maintain his current supply levels at 85 percent of his cost. They shake hands. Bello leaves. Charlie arrives and tells him his ""watch went dead' with the listening device. Briggs tells her they didn't miss much and walks away with a smile."

Mike and Briggs debrief and Mike tells him Bello told him he made the deal with Odin. Briggs complains about being shut out. They note the next big shipment is tomorrow so maybe they'll get lucky and catch him.

The next morning Briggs awakes at 5:30 and meditates and works out. He then heads out to the apartment where he stored Charlie while she was detoxing. In the closet that was locked, he walks into a crawl space full of bricks of drugs and the stickers that are ""Odin's mark."" He leaves them in a gym bag in a locker in a gym and texts Bello the location. Mike gets the money from Bello, switches the bags and tells Briggs to meet him there. He retrieves the bag and the FBI guys sweep the bag for evidence of Odin as Briggs watches. Mike delivers the drugs to Bello's assembly line, which is hot girls in their underwear wearing face masks divvying up the drugs in bags with Odin's mark. Then Briggs and Mike watch street level dealers sell the drugs. The whole process from nearly beginning to end which will net Bello and Odin nearly 2 million dollars.

As they watch the deal go down, Mike complains about how hard the job is. Briggs swears they're going to get him and that Odin will make a mistake. Mike notes that they found Briggs' DNA on the bag.... and that they also found Mike's own DNA and says, with a smile, that so far they're the only one making mistakes.

Mike gently teases Abby awake in bed. They kiss. He gets a text from Charlie saying they need him to look at security footage. She wants him to beg off. He says he can't. She starts asking questions and asks if he's seeing someone else. He says he doesn't have a secret girlfriend. She wants to know why she hasn't seen his house then. She says it's time for the ""exclusive"" talk. He says this guy at work that is like the brother he wished he had has a substance abuse problem. She hopes he reported him. He says he did but he loves the guy but he feels like a rat. She says he did the right thing and anyone who knows him would know he's not a rat.

Mike heads home and lies that he wasn't with Abby and that he was with a rebound. She says she has her own undercover heroin case to work on that night.

Jakes and Johnny work out at the gym, staking it out waiting for ""Odin"" to come get the money. Jakes complains they have the whole place covered by cameras and they could be watching from home. Charlie does just that. Mike watches with her. None of the money has been picked up. Briggs comes in and says maybe Odin doesn't care about money, noting they don't know anything about him.

Jakes and Johnny switch their stakeout to the car outside the gym. Johnny asks about things being weird in the house. Jakes says he worries about his own problems. Johnny says they're friends. Jakes says not to get it twisted and this isn't his family.

Briggs and Mike have a conversation about Briggs' confession. He says he hasn't heard anything from the bureau and thanks Mike for keeping his secret and that he knows secrets are a burden. Mike asks if it's hard to be around all this heroin. Briggs says it is but having Mike around keeps him honest. Mike notes honesty is a hard thing to come by. Briggs agrees.

Mike calls Badillo and asks what's going on. He then makes another drop of drugs to Bello at the abandoned bank they are using as HQ. He pulls Bello aside and says they might have a security issue. He asks Bello how he can protect him from someone Mike doesn't know what he looks like. Bello says he's willing to take the risk. Just then gun men come in and shoot up the place. They kill everyone, including the girls divvying up the drugs. Mike and Bello take the three men down. Bello tells them to take the bodies with them so they can tie up loose ends.

They take them to the warehouse and Bello starts to torture one to get info out of there. The hitman being tortured is from the cartel. Mike calls in. Briggs tells him he has two options: they can roll in right now and save the cartel hitman's life, nab Bellow, but blow nabbing Odin. Or Mike can save his life and preserve their ability to get Odin. Charlie is mad, since it's clear is Mike right on the edge, he can't take hearing the guy being tortured. Briggs says he gave Mike a choice. Mike enters the room where the guy is being tortured. The hitman says that cartel is sending a message if that Bello comes back to them for drugs all will be forgiven. Bello says you don't send a hit squad to negotiate a truce and then he chops off the guy's hand. Mike flinches. Charlie and Briggs overhear all of this. Mike says to send the hitman back as a message. The hitman says they're all dead now, that the real hitman ""Jangles"" is coming to kill them all. Bello commends him on his plan. Mike pretends to be happy about all of this.

At the beach Charlie notes to Briggs that Mike saved the guy's life and they preserved the Bello connection but he's probably scarred for life. Briggs notes that they now also know that the cartel is moving on Bello which is progress in his book. Briggs says the cartel is the real enemy and that's what he wants. Charlie says he always has to push it too far. Mike arrives and Charlie gently touches his face and says she's happy to see him and hugs him. Briggs asks if he's really okay. Mike says he doesn't feel anything. Briggs says it will hit him later. Mike asks him if this was really all about getting to ""Jangles"" -- that he had him let Bello torture the guy because he knew he had information on Jangles. Briggs tries to reassure and Mike says he doesn't want to be played by Briggs and leaves him.

Mike heads to Abby's and she knows something is wrong. He says people around him keep getting hurt. She asks if he's responsible. He says yes, for some of it. She says he then needs to take some responsibility that he always has a choice. She starts to get upset and he tries to comfort her. He invites her to Graceland. She notes that he's told her there's rules about that. He says he's not in a rule-following mood.

Johnny, Jakes, and Charlie wait outside the gym in the car, she tells them the story of Mike and the torturer and Briggs. Charlie ""borrows"" Johnny for a little while.

Briggs sits in the CI apartment and contemplates shooting up.

Charlie says she wants to go check on Briggs because she thinks something is wrong. Johnny agrees that something is up. Charlie brings up the theory that Briggs is Odin. Johnny doesn't like this at first but agrees. Charlie says they're not stabbing him in the back and she brought him to be the devil's advocate. They get to the door and he hears them as Charlie tries to pick the lock.

Mike shows Abby around Graceland which she says is like walking into Anthropologie.

They enter and notice the drugs on the table. They poke around. They find the closet and it's unlocked now. Briggs is sweating it out on the other side of the wall.

Abby wants to see Mike's room and he shows her but tells her to be quiet. He shows her the room. He notices a gun on the dresser and throws his coat over it quickly. She notes how nice it is but is quite Spartan. She notes that he doesn't see the space as permanent. He says part of him wishes it was because he loves the people. He asks if she still thinks he has a secret girlfriend. She says no. he goes to the bathroom and she notes the crime scene photo and opens the door and sees Paige with a gun. Paige sees her and says her dad is one of those guys who thinks single girls should have guns. Paige pulls Mike aside and says she's she'll cover for him and to get her the hell out. Abby picks up their coats and sees Mike's gun and asks who he is. She freaks out and says it's clear that he's been lying to her. She declines his offer of a ride home and kisses him goodbye. She says to call him if he ever figures it out. Paige is livid saying he just risked everything. He says it's over and he was sick of lying to her. Paige says everything he told her was a lie. Mike said he could feel safe with her. She says that's what Graceland is for. He says everyone has secrets there. He notes that Briggs breaks the rules all the time and gets away with it and he breaks one and it blows up in his face. Paige notes he needs to know which rules to break.

Mike brings another bag to the FBI to sweep and says they'll never catch Odin this way. Briggs tells him to stick to the plan. Mike calls an audible telling Bello he went to the drop and that there were no drugs there. He goes back to Briggs and Charlie and they argue this will force Bello and Odin into a meet. Briggs says Bello will think Mike stole the drugs and that he just risked this case and his own life.

Briggs goes to his closet and gets dugs. Bello calls and says they need to meet. Briggs says he'll text him the details. He hauls out a ton of drugs and throws them on the bed.

Charlie, Johnny, and Briggs stake out the potential meet spot. Briggs texts Bello a new locale and Charlie follows him on foot. Briggs sends Johnny off to follow a ""stolen car."" Mike asks if Briggs wants back up and Briggs says he can handle it.

Bello goes into the changing room of a store and moves aside the mirror and walks through a hole in the wall. Briggs and Bellow meet and Briggs says the cartel got to him. He hands Bello the keys to the apartment saying there's enough drugs there to hold him for a couple of months and to keep paying him in the same installments.

Charlie goes into the changing room and finds the hole in the wall as Johnny sees Bello exit a different store. Charlie heads through the hole, and Mike and Johnny enter from other points and Briggs is trapped. Briggs jumps Mike from behind. They tussle. Briggs manages to stun him with a chokehold without him seeing him. He fires a shot. Charlie and Johnny run in and find Briggs over Mike. Briggs claims that Odin just ran out and that he might have shot him. Mike awakes and Briggs asks if he saw him. Mike says no.

The next day at breakfast Johnny tells Jakes he was right that it's best to mind your own business in this house. Johnny commends Jakes for always being straight with him.

Mike goes to Briggs who is lying in bed. He asks if he's up for a run and Briggs says no. He tells Mike not to beat himself up for letting Odin get away. Mike thanks him for saving his life again and tells him that even though he didn't see him he learned a lot about him from the way he fights: that the guy was 6'2"", well-built, maybe some military training. He also thinks he broke a few of the guy's ribs. Briggs tells him he's proud of him. Mike leaves. Briggs then rises from bed and looks at his bruised chest in the mirror, grimacing at his broken ribs."

Mike runs on the beach. He is frustrated.

Briggs tosses in bed. He is in pain. He puts an icepack on the ribs that Mike bruised/broke.

Johnny showers. Charlie brushes her teeth. They joke around in the bathroom. She admits her curiosit about Briggs is not yet satisfied. She says lack of evidence doesn't equal innocence.

Paige, who was surfing, chats with Mike on the beach. He is sad about Abby.

They all convene in the kitchen for breakfast, Johnny cooks ""ghetto scramble.""

Mike says all is quiet on the Bello/Caza cartel front for the moment. Briggs says it won't be for long because ""Jangles"" will soon be showing up. Charlie wants to move on Odin. Briggs says he's a ghost and doesn't want to waste energy on the hunt.

Mike gets a call. It turns out that Jangles killed one of Bello's corner dealers and hung his shoes from telephone wire. The shoes still have the dealer's feet in them.

Briggs sits on the beach and makes a call to a Diane hotel and arranges for keys to be let in a planter there for him so he can make a ""discreet"" entrance. He picks them up and enters the hotel later that night. He hangs up a smoke detector surveillance system. He heads back to Graceland enjoys some tea and looks at the empty room all night.

Mike drives to meet Bello at his fancy safe house. His team has ears on him through his watch. They share a cigar. Mike says he seems happy. Bello says he's not scared by the feet on the wire. He says he's seen worse and has some henchmen bring out ""the case. The case is full of automatic weapons.

Charlie is chatting with a source who tells her Federales got a hit on a Mexican shell company with ties to Odin Rossi. Money was taken from the account to get a hotel room. She thinks she can find Odin in the room. (Which is obviously the room that Briggs is surveilling.)

Bello hands out the high powered firearms to his crew. It is supposed to make them look like a ""deterrent."" Mike is supposed to train them.

Back at Graceland Mike and Briggs talk about Bello and Mike says he wants to go to the FBI and bring Bello in. He feels guilty that when bullets start flying on the streets he will have trained the people shooting. Briggs says they have to wait, to catch one monster in order to get another, in this case Jangles, and Odin. Briggs wants justice just like Mike. Mike wonders if he really wants vengeance. Briggs says he wants both and closure.

Mike goes to Juan and asks why Briggs is still in the field since he said he was going to get help. Juan says there's more work to be done and to keep on it and he thinks Briggs is connected to the Caza cartel and probably wants to sell Bello out. Juan says sometimes it's about using one monster as bait to catch another monster, echoing exactly what Briggs said. Mike immediately backs off when hearing this. He heads home, finds the picture Juan gave him of his grandfather's crime scene photo, smashes it and underneath the picture finds a bug. Paige comes in because she heard the frame smashing. He said the frame ""fell."" As she helps him with a Band-Aid she says her BS detector is going off and she had hoped that he trusted her enough to help him. He says he does trust her but it's complicated. He says she wouldn't understand. She says she's trying to. He still clams up. She says to keep doing what he's doing because it's clearly working out.

Charlie cases the Diane Motel where Briggs is staying. She breaks into a room. Briggs watches. He exclaims ""shit"" when he sees her walk in. She looks through the room. She sees the camera with which he is watching her. It's hidden in a smoke detector. She pulls it off the wall. As she's leaving a man enters gun drawn. She pulls her gun. He shows his Federales badge, Rafael Cortez. He says he pictured Odin Rossi being a woman. She says she pictured him looking like Rafael Cortez. She shows her FBI badge. He is the Federales who got the tip about the money from the Mexican shell company being used to get the room. He followed her in because he was also casing the joint. He suggests working together, pooling their resources, since Odin has given them very little to go on. She says she'll have to think about it. (So Briggs used the money on purpose to draw out the Federales but didn't plan on it tipping off Charlie. But he did not see their conversation.)

Mike confronts Juan with the bug from his room. He asks if he told Briggs about their investigation. He was afraid he was losing Mike to Briggs. Mike asks why Juan is so fixated on Briggs since he's never even met him. Juan levels with him that Graceland isn't the first of its kind, that Briggs worked in a house called Estate. Juan knew Briggs' training officer Roberto, they were friends at Quantico. His friend and four other agents died in a house fire in the Estate. Badillo thinks he was turned by Caza cartel and burned down the house and killed his friend and the others. Mike says they have no proof to tie Briggs to the fire. Nine hours earlier a call from a payphone came to the house and then later to a girl in the house Briggs was seeing. Juan starts getting a little unhinged and says that Mike is going to help him get Briggs. Mike says he isn't and walks out.

Briggs and Johnny chat at the house. He asks if there's something ""up"" with Charlie. Johnny says she's not over Whistler and the stuff that happened between them at the house. He admits that Charlie thinks something's up between him and Odin. He acts surprised. He switches gears to talk about trying to catch Jangles and asks if Johnny can help. Johnny thinks he can.

They go to a divey bar. They chat with the pretty bartender. Johnny's really into her but she's not allowed to date ""bangers"" and notes that he'd have more luck with his actual badge. Briggs wants info. But Johnny tells him to be patient. Johnny asks her about the ""chopped off feet."" She says she heard people joking about it and points one out in the bar at the moment. Briggs goes to check it out.

Charlie does research on Cortez.

Mike delivers Chinese food to Bello. Bello asks what the mood is out there. Mike says his men are scared. Bello thinks this is good. Mike says the Caza cartel isn't after him but Odin and he wonders why he doesn't just sell him out. Bello says this is a war and beating Caza is worth it, it buys him independence. Mike points out that his men are going to die. Bello says no more talking and no more deals. He says that the lives of his men mean something to him and he doesn't take joy from their bloodshed. He says Mike taught the men to shoot the enemy and they will be fine and they toast that they shared victory will be sweet.

Johnny continues to chat with the bartender and tells her he's thinking about joining the LAPD but she can't tell anyone. Briggs returns to the bar and says the guys in the booth include one of Bello's guys selling them out on where Bello's safe house is. They scramble to tell Mike and assemble a team.

Bello and Mike jaw about the great combo of Chinese food and cigars like Butch and Sundance. Bello objects to their quippiness and the ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" song. Suddenly the sprinklers go off.

Mike goes to shut them of and one of Bello's men is dead. he calls for back-up.

Briggs drives and tries to make a call but no one is picking up. He comes upon Mike's back-up crew that he just called for back-up and they're all dead. Briggs runs with his gun. We cut to Bello being torture by Jangles. Jangles asks where Odin Rossi is. Bello refuses to help. Mike's shoe squeaks and Jangles hears. A shootout ensues but Mike can't hit Jangles. He tells Bello to run. Jangles stabs Mike. Briggs arrives and shoots at him and misses. He goes to Mike who tells him to go after Jangles. Briggs says ""next time."" He applies pressure on the wound until back-up shows up. Bello is led out in cuffs. Mike makes the FBI guys read him his rights in front of Bello. Then he passes out. Briggs can't catch up with Jangles.

Mike wakes up in a hotel room. Hazy. Paige is there. She says the doctor says he will need time to get better. He asks if there are any gifts from the FBI or an anonymous source. She asks what's going on. He says they all lie for the job and that they can walk in Graceland and be themselves but he can't because he was placed in Graceland to investigate Briggs. She accuses him of being a ""rat."" She said he could trust her and now that he's spilling she abandons him.

Juan sits in the car and listens to surveillance from Mike's room of him and Briggs talking and of Briggs saying he never saw Jangles because he always wore a bandanda. Juan puts on a bandanna and looks in the rear-view mirror.

Charlie meets with Rafael Cortez at a diner. (Looking at his hair now, I'm guessing he's ""Jangles."") He congratulates her on the FBI taking down Bello. She asks what the rumor is on his side. He said the police thinks the Caza are escorting Jangles back to Mexico but he says he guarantees he's still around. Charlie says she will work Odin out of Bello. She talks about them working together. He loves this idea. We pull back and see e blood marks on his jacket.

Briggs is drunk on the beach by a bonfire. He looks at a charm and remembers the agent Lisa that he loved in the Estate. Juan Badillo is in his car and reports into a tape recorder that he is about to approach Briggs and that he is undercover as the Caza mercenary known as Jangles. Briggs cries on the beach and pound the sand. Juan approaches. he says ""you're looking for me right?"" Briggs asks if he knows what this place is? Jangles says he does and that Briggs killed everyone here. Briggs says they both did and that Jangles lit the match by making him a junkie. Juan pulls a gun which confuses Briggs since Jangles didn't use guns. They struggle and the gun goes off and Juan is dead."

We open where we left off, a drunk Briggs on the beach contemplating the fact that he just shot Juan Badillo, who he thinks was his Caza cartel tormentor ""Jangles.""

We flashback to a year and a half ago. The gang was playing darts at the bar with the old agent Donnie who still lived in the house. They were talking about another agent who was being brought up on manslaughter charges for killing a suspect while on drugs. Johnny was new to the house at that point. Briggs says one too many drinks or pills can mean the difference between a medal and a murder rap.

We come back to the present. Briggs rolls the body up in a tarp, goes over the scene, and heads out. We see that Badillo's car is in the distance with a tape recorder in it rolling. Briggs takes Badillo to a remote desert location and buries the body. He notices on the keychain a key that says ""Apt. 3.""

Bello is in custody trying to cut a deal. He wants immunity for giving up on Odin Rossi. Charlie tries to scare him by saying the Caza cartel members in jail will repeatedly shank and rape him in prison and if he gives up Rossi they can put him in protective custody. He wants immunity, period.

Mike returns to the house a few days earlier, having checked out against medical advice. He is still clearly hurting.

Johnny is trying to plan a surprise party for Jakes. Jakes hates surprise parties which is why he's doing it. He has decided on a bounce house and strippers. No one is up for helping him though. Paige is out when she sees Mike is back. Charlie is pre-occupied with Bello and Briggs is MIA.

The next morning at breakfast Jakes warns Johnny not to throw him a party.

Charlie meets with her Federale contact Cortez (aka Jangles.) They both say they have nothing: he has nothing on Jangles, she has nothing on Odin Rossi. The Federale says Bello must have a weakness, someone or something he cares about. Charlie gets an idea.

Briggs tells Mike to count his sutures as a badge of honor. Charlie heads home with her plan: she wants Mike to go undercover in prison with Bello, thinking Bello will give up Odin to protect Mike. Briggs argues against it vehemently, under the guise of it being bad for Mike, not protect his identity as Odin. Mike says he's in.

Mike orange suits up and meets with Bello in the prison yard. He tells Mike that maybe he can do something.

Jakes sneaks into Johnny's room and sees the brochure for the bounce house and cancels it but says to charge his card anyway. Johnny overhears and re-orders it.

Briggs finds Charlie in Mike's room looking through his drawers. She says the banged up frame with his grandfather's photo. She tells him she was looking for Mike's meds to bring to him in jail. She tells him she's going right when visitation starts. Briggs gets an idea: he calls the prison and sets up a visitation with Bello--right when it starts. Bello knows who Charlie is.

The next morning when he comes into the visiting room he sees Mike talking to her and realizes he's a Fed. He attacks the already injured Mike and pummels him before the guards can pull him off. He screams at Mike: ""I trusted you!""

Charlie brings the injured Mike home--where Johnny is still trying to get Paige excited for Jakes' party. Charlie is livid and calls Briggs on the carpet. She tells him what happened and that it had to be an Odin thing since no one showed up for the visitation. Mike gets a call to come into the bureau right then, everyone thinks he's getting a commendation.

It is not a commendation. The director Clark tells him that Badillo is missing and they think that Briggs has something to do with it. Clark has in his possession a little essay Mike wrote when he was 9 years old where he talks about wanting to be an FBI agent and that it's all about truth and justice. He wants Mike to keep looking into Briggs. Mike says he will but he's confused because as far as he knows Briggs didn't even know Badillo. Clark says they can't find his car but think Badillo was probably recording so when they find it it will be helpful.

Johnny is busy blowing up the bounce house in the living room and welcoming strippers to the house. Charlie is going over the detention center's incoming calls to isolate who called in the visitation to Bello. Briggs notes she's doing it right in front of everyone instead of upstairs. She says she was hoping to inspire him to help her. When he declines she storms upstairs.

Mike returns home and Paige pulls him aside to talk. Briggs and Johnny think they're having a ""lover's quarrel.""

Paige is still angry. Mike explains what happens and tells her about Briggs being a junkie and the Juan Badillo stuff. She tells him to tell Briggs about the investigation and that he isn't a murderer. They talk, he wonders aloud if that's a good idea, but asks ""what if we're wrong?""

Jakes is busy spending his birthday in the bar talking to Derek, the man now living with his ex-girlfriend Cassie and son Daniel. They talk a bit. Derek admits he's having trouble with Cassie and is spending the night in a motel. Jakes admits that he used to have a family and he walked away from it. They both tell each other to fight for what they want. Knowing that Derek is out at the motel, Jakes goes to Cassie's at 3 am, drunk, pounds on the door and essentially begs to take him back. He lets slip that he talked to Derek and she is officially done with him.

When he returns home, he finds only Johnny and one of the strippers. He hauls off and slugs Johnny, needing to hit someone. They fight. Johnny is legitimately hurt that Jakes doesn't seem to care about him. Johnny notes that he has nothing else.. Jakes stumbles to his room. Johnny goes upstairs and stands in the hallway in the middle of the rooms and unloads. He yells at all the closed doors, behind which all the inhabitants are awake, that they are a family whether they like it or not. And given that they spend so much time cozying up to drug dealers and low life's the fact that he wants to blow off some steam and forget about all that dark stuff for one night with his friends/family shouldn't be too much to ask.

Mike visits Bello in prison. Bello basically calls him on the fact that he was also a drug dealer and complicit in torture and death, especially with regards to Eddie. Bello tells him that at least he is paying for his sins, unlike Mike.

Mike confesses to Briggs about his investigation. Briggs isn't surprised. Mike essentially says he trusts him and is on his side and he tells him about Badillo being missing. Briggs, truthfully, says he's never heard of Badillo. Mike says he's going to find Badillo's car and wants Briggs to help. Briggs says that would look bad, like a cover-up. Mike agrees and then apologizes. Briggs looks both pleased and worried.

Charlie meets with the Federale/Jangles and brings the surveillance devices she found in the Diane Motel. She posits the theory that Odin is a federal agent. She says she doesn't have a name but it seems clear she thinks it's Briggs. He says when she has a name, he'll help. She says they're in the hunt together. He asks how they should proceed.

Mike tells Paige he told him. She wonders why. She says to see his face when he said Badillo's name. Mike says he had no idea who he was.

Briggs looks up Badillo in the FBI database and realizes he's in a world of trouble."

Briggs lies in bed in contemplation at 2:30 a.m. He hops on his laptop and looks at the ""missing"" poster for Juan Badillo. He notes the address and heads out. In the living room he chats with Mike who's pretending to be asleep Briggs goes back to the kitchen and abandons his plan to leave. For now.

He goes to Jakes and wakes him up and asks for his help, calling in a favor he owes him. He says he needs a car to disappear across the border in the way only a customs agent knows how. But not now, tomorrow.

Mike and Paige put a tracker on Briggs' car. They both feel bad but still do it.

Johnny makes shaped pancakes. He won't make a special one for Jakes. He asks for help on closing down his bird smuggling operation. Briggs volunteers. Mike asks about Badillo and Briggs says he's staying far away and that if anyone can find the car it's Mike. He heads out with Jakes and they take his car, thus avoiding the tracker.

Mike watches the tracker and there's no movement and realize they took Jakes' truck. Paige tells them to focus on what they can control and that's finding Juan's car.

Turns out Jakes wasn't lying about the birds, it wasn't just an alibi. Jakes tells Briggs about running into Cassandra and how bad it went and that's why it went down with Johnny. And that Johnny will get over it. Briggs tells Jakes to let her go, since it's impossible with the job.

Charlie and Rafael dress to meet. He also gets his ""Jangles"" doctor bag and keys ready to go.

Charlie and Johnny argue about how she ruined the bouncy house. They then argue about how no one is helping with her case against Odin.

Jakes and Briggs head to look for the car. Briggs says he needs to get something from the car. They think it got jacked.

Simultaneously, Paige and Mike find the guy who jacked it online at a gas station surveillance camera in Long Beach.

Charlie and Cortez meet at a bar and talk about their respective quests: her for Odin and him for ""Jangles"" -- which is of course him. He asks if anyone knows she's working with him. She says no. He says maybe he can track Odin, who she thinks is an FBI agent and she doesn't want to give up his name yet.

Jakes and Briggs keep looking for the car, thinking a gangbanger took it. Briggs gets very upset and pounds the dashboard. Jakes pulls over and asks him what's really up, ""what's in the car?"" He admits it's a recording. Jakes demands more answers. Briggs tells him he killed an FBI agent. He explains the whole scenario, Jangles, the struggle, the gun. He thought he'd gotten Jangles but it was an FBI agent Juan Badillo who wanted him to incriminate himself with the Caza cartel. Jakes can't believe it but says he will help.

Briggs and Charlie head to a hotel room and she's drunk and Jangles wants to do her in, but Johnny calls her just as they're going in. Charlie says they have to take a raincheck. Jangles is not happy.

Mike and Paige go to church to speak to the mother of the guy who jacked the car. She wouldn't talk to FBI agents so they pretend she is pregnant and hope to appeal to her motherly side. She asks to find him but the mother is bitchy and rude shuts her down and thinks she's trashy. But she gives up the address.

Just then Briggs and Jakes show up at the guy's front, a donut shop. Briggs brings in one of the exotic birds as a gift. Clayton, the smash and grab guy, is grateful for the bird for his evil mom. Briggs claims that he's looking for work, says he's trying to get a girl back quickly. Clayton says he has a job but needs two guys. he calls in Jakes.

Paige and Mike show up at the donut shop and see Jakes in the truck. He tells him Briggs is inside. Just then Briggs' texts him to come in. Instead Mike walks in. Briggs is shocked to say the least but he covers. Clayton gives them a smash and grab job for the next day. They walk out and argue, Briggs claims he was lying and of course he's looking for the car. He lies again and says he never heard of the guy. Briggs says clearly Mike has doubts too. Mike says he'll believe what he hears on the tape in Juan's car.

Charlie and Johnny figure out how to work on Quinn, the evil drug dealer who worked for Odin. She normally worked with Briggs but since she thinks Briggs is Odin, she can't do that so she tells Johnny she's going to work with ""another"" partner but won't tell him Cortez' name.

Paige and Mike mull over whether Briggs is trustworthy. Jakes and Briggs try to work out how he can get the tape during the mission the next day. He asks Jakes to bust Mike first when the tack team moves in so he can get the recording.

The next day Mike and Briggs and wait on the corner and Paige and Jakes wait with the tack team. Clayton shows up in a fancy car, the wrong one. They go with him after they confirm that he has the Crown Vic.

Charlie goes to Cortez for help to work on Quinn. She claims it should be an easy in and out. Johnny shows up and busts Cortez's balls. Cortez says he's not corrupt and he's on Charlie's side. Johnny says he's in. Jangles is not happy.

Clayton and the gang head to Koreatown to do the smash-and-grab. They put on ski masks, grab guns, and plan to knock off a ""massage"" parlor. Jakes and Paige and the tack team follow and wait for it to play out. Jakes and Paige bicker a bit knowing that they are on opposing ""sides."" Although Jakes claims he isn't on a specific side.

The gang, including Mike and Briggs, rampage through the parlor and busts the johns and grab their wallets. As they are about to jam, Mike handcuffs Briggs to a structure in the massage parlor. Briggs pulls his gun on him and threatens to shoot him. Mike begs him to let him prove him innocent and jumps into the getaway car.

Jakes comes in and uncuffs Briggs and asks him what he wants to do next since Mike knows where the car is and Briggs doesn't. Briggs says Mike beat him with a suckerpunch and that the game is over and he needs to go get a head start. Jakes asks a head start on what. Briggs says the rest of his life.

Charlie and Cortez go to see Quinn. Cortez is nervous. They try to convince Quinn to get him to text Odin and dangle Jangles. Quinn and Cortez get into it and Charlie says she'll take it from there. Quinn hits on her and she hits him.. They fight. She throws him into a table and starts beating his face in, remembering Whistler, her informant.

Clayton and the smash and grab gang arrive at the Crown Vic. Mike pulls his gun and announces he's a federal agent.

Briggs heads home to Graceland. It's empty.

The tack team arrives with Paige to the Crown Vic. Jakes is not with them.

Briggs moves aside an altar in Gracelnad and punches a hole in the wall. He pulls out a bag with money and passports.

Paige and Mike open the Crown Vic but the recorder is gone.

Briggs gives Graceland one last look and walks out."

We pick up where we left off with Briggs bugging out of Graceland with a bag full of cash, passports and ID. He gets a call from Mike as he's leaving but he ignores him.

Mike sends out an APB on Briggs and Johnny gets it as he's going into Graceland. Briggs bluffs that it's part of his cover with the Caza cartel and Johnny lets him leave.

Briggs has Jakes drop him off at the marina saying he's hopping a boat to his new life and they say their goodbyes.

But you know our boy Briggs is more crafty than that.

He meets up with the drug dealer Quinn who worked for Odin but didn't know him. Since Charlie put the fear of Jangles into him, Quinn wants to skip town. Briggs gives him the new IDs and passports with the name Tony Brusca. Quinn hands him cash and hops a boat to Ecuador.

Jakes calls Briggs and tells him that Charlie has been working with a Federale. He puts it together with what he saw on the surveillance video at the Diane hotel. Briggs drives to where he buried Juan Badillo and grabs the key labeled Apt. 3 off the body. He then goes looking for Jangles. Jakes also tells Briggs there's no recording.

Everyone in the house is interrogated and the house is swept and the roommates begin fighting with many considering Mike a rat and there is fear that Graceland will be shut down. Johnny asks Jakes why Briggs didn't come to him for help and Jakes says he needs to grow up. Mike wants to find Briggs and keep Graceland open.

Mike works on figuring out what Briggs is doing. He works out that he's still in L.A. and gets excited. In his excitement he kisses Paige. She stops him and says she would be willing but not like this because it's not about her.

Briggs shows up at Jakes' son's soccer game. Briggs tells him about Charlie and Jangles but Jakes doesn't want to hear it since what he's done has sent the house into a frenzy of trouble.

Charlie meets with Jangles and has a drink. They toast to mending a broken heart. She begs off going home with him. But then has a change of heart and heads to the house where he is staying on the beach.

Briggs has arrived first, however. He enters and manages to put the Badillo key on Jangles' keychain but he hears him and comes down and confronts him. They fight. Charlie enters confused and Jangles knocks Briggs out and tells Charlie to cuff him. But, of course, he then turns on her and assaults her and holds both her and Briggs hostage.

He forces Briggs to watch as he hurts Charlie, cutting her with a knife. Thanks to GPS tracking, Mike arrives to save the day. He enters the house and Jangles confronts him and Mike shoots him. He rescues Briggs ad Charlie and Charlie kicks Jangles' body on the way out.

Briggs asks Mike how he figured it out. Mike explains and then Birggs also explains more fully. It turns out that while he was shooting up Briggs all he wanted to know was who the mole in the Caza cartel was. After getting him hooked, they left him to detox and he became so crazed that he gave up a fellow agent as the mole. That agent also lived in the Estate and Jangles went and burned the house down, killing Lisa, Briggs' girlfriend, as well.

Mike learns he's getting shipped to D.C. to become the special assistant to the deputy director.

The Feds find the evidence that Jangles killed Badillo-- the key that Briggs put on him. They also believe that Quinn, now on the run in Ecuador, is the infamous Odin Rossi. Briggs got off and is free as a bird. Charlie apologizes to Briggs and says she is wracked with guilt, saying she's going to turn in her badge. Briggs says the house needs her. They hug.

Briggs tells Jakes they're even. They both wonder where the recording is. Neither knows. Jakes tells Briggs he now needs to fix Graceland. (Especially since he knows that Briggs killed Juan.)

The housemates have a bonfire. Briggs makes a speech about heroin addiction and says he forgot about home and apologizes. They toast Mike's return back to East Coast. Briggs and Mike smile at each other.

Back in D.C. going over stuff in a high level meeting, Mike reminisces about Graceland.

We cut to a pawn shop. Two teen boys approach a tape recorder. They press play and we hear Briggs' murder of Juan Badillo. They take the tape.

Briggs calls Mike just to check in. The season ends with Briggs saying to Mike, ""Listen I haven't told anyone else about this..."""

-----

On Earth in 1943, the Nazis spread out from Germany and across Europe. The Allied scientists band together to create a super-soldier, and Steve Rogers becomes Captain America. But in a different universe, a different choice created a new hero.

Peggy Carter and Steve watch the preparations for the super-soldier program, and Peggy points out that if the project works, Steve could end the war. They approach the head scientist, Abraham Erskine, and Peggy says that she prefers to stay rather than watch from the booth. She and the observers step back as Steve is put in the machine. Peggy sees one of the ""observers"" use a remote to trigger a planted explosive before she can stop him, and the saboteur runs to the transformation chamber. He shoots Steve when the latter tries to stop him, then grabs a vial of the serum as Howard Stark looks on.

Stepping up, Peggy shoots the saboteur dead. She runs to Steve and Howard says that they're losing the power levels and need to activate the process now. When the commander, Colonel John Flynn, orders Howard to get into the chamber, Howard says that he's not a soldier but it has to be now. Peggy puts the vial back in the machine, gets in, and Howard activates the process. When the process is over, the chamber opens and Peggy emerges, larger and more muscular.

As the doctors take blood samples from Peggy, Flynn complains that they've wasted money. He tells Peggy that all of Erskine's serum went into her, and analysis of her blood might show them how to make a ""real"" super-soldier. He dismisses women as not soldiers, much to Peggy's disgust, and walks off.

Later, Peggy works out in the gym working a bag. Steve watches as Peggy knocks the bag across the room, and throws another weight into the wall in anger. The 107th march past outside, and Steve says that his friend Bucky is with them and they are deploying but the Army won't tell Steve where Bucky is going. Steve tells Peggy that she'll be the one to end the war, and the two of them flirt briefly.

Nazi forces led by Hydra take over the town of Tensberg, Norway, and Howard detects gamma radiation from the clock tower. The power levels could power London for a century, or destroy it.

Johann Schmidt leads the Nazis in Tensberg, and finds the Tesseract hidden in the church. The soldiers kill the priest guarding it.

Howard and Peggy have done research on the Tesseract, and Howard wants to send a team to take it on its way to Berlin. Flynn objects, and refuses to let Peggy go when she volunteers. The colonel figures the war will be over before Hydra figures out how to use the Tesseract.

Peggy goes to a bar and drinks, and Howard joins her and gives a costume and a shield.

Soldiers accompany Arnim Zola and the Tesseract into Berlin via motorcade. Peggy attacks the motorcade using her shield. She then jumps down from a building and uses her shield and her super-strength to flip the lead truck. Peggy takes down the remaining soldiers and then takes out a burly soldier in hand-to-hand after he challenges her.

Peggy steps into the back of the truck where Zola is still sitting, takes the Tesseract and returns to the Allied base and shows it to Flynn. She tells him that they won't win the war with her stuck behind a desk, and Flynn tells her that she's not qualified for field duty. Peggy tells Flynn to promote her to captain and leaves. Howard is there, and says that he knows what to do with the Tesseract.

Later, Howard makes a large metal suit as Steve looks on. Howard asks Steve if he's ready to join the war effort.

Later, Peggy and Steve confirm where the 107th are pinned down by enemy fire. As they prepare to leave, Steve takes Peggy's hand and says that he owes Peggy one. Peggy tells him that Steve owes her a dance and squeezes his hand.

In the field, Peggy takes a soldier's motorcycle and crashes through the gate leading to a factory. She takes out the soldiers on guard, finds the prisoners including Dum Dum Dugan. Bucky is there, and asks who Peggy is supposed to be, and Peggy rips his cell door off with her bare hands. Peggy says that Steve sent her, and she's Captain Carter.

Peggy and the 107th fight their way out, and Nazi tanks arrive. They take cover and Peggy calls in air support, and Steve flies in wearing the battlesuit Howard made for him. Using the suit's enhanced strength, Steve stops one tank and then several more with the suit's weaponry. Peggy joins him and together they take out the remaining tanks. As the 107th join them, Steve opens up his suit and leads a cheer for Captain Carter.

Soon Peggy is fighting more Nazis. Flynn is taking credit for ""his"" decision"", and tells the President that he told Howard to build the ""Hydra Stomper"". The two of them fly up and take out Nazi fighters.

At Castle Krake in Germany, Johann is examining the plaque that concealed the Tesseract. Hitler demands that Johann come to Berlin, and Johann says that a ""god"" doesn't answer to a man. Johann tells the officer sent to escort him that soon the true champion of Hydra will be summoned from beyond the stars. When the office questions him, Johann shoots him dead and his men hold the officer's guards at gunpoint. Johann pulls off his human mask, revealing a skinless red skull beneath and says that Hydra will rise from the Third Reich's ashes.

Peggy and Steve share a drink, and Steve tells Peggy that she's always been a fighter. He admits that he envies the respect Peggy receives, and Peggy assures him that he's her hero. Steve tells Peggy that she's his hero. Bucky and Howard arrive and Howard realizes that something is going on between Peggy and Steve.

Peggy, Bucky, and a squad of soldiers intercept the train Red Skull is on, but Bucky figures that it's a trap. Steve flies up in the Hydra Stomper and stops the train, and the others drop down on lines onto the top of the train. Steve breaks into the train and finds explosives but no sign of Red Skull. As Steve yells a warning to the others, the explosives go off. Peggy and the others leap off the back of the train, and the mountain collapses into the crevasse alongside the tracks.

Running to the wreckage, Peggy looks for Steve. The mountain starts to come down, and Bucky tells Peggy that they have to go. They leave just as an avalanche comes down.

Later, Peggy, Howard, and Flynn meet in Flynn's office and Flynn complains that they failed. Peggy reminds Flynn that they lost Steve, not just a battlesuit, and walks off. She goes to the imprisoned Zola, who says that he will tell her nothing.

After a few minutes of interrogation, Peggy tells the others that Zola told her everything. Red Skull believes he can unleash an interdimensional force that will lead Hydra to world domination, or world annihilation. Red Skull is at Krake, and Peggy says that it's time to take the fight to Red Skull. She warns that they might not succeed in ending the war or themselves survive, but they will stop Hydra. The others agree to take the mission--for Steve-- and even Howard agrees to go with them.

Soon, Peggy infiltrates Krake and opens the gate so the others can enter. They split up, Peggy and Howard going one way while the soldiers go another.

Red Skull puts the Tesseract in a machine of his own devising and has one of his men activate the machine. The Tesseract opens a portal. Bucky and the soldiers shoot their way into a room, and find Hydra Stomper fastened powerless into a holding device.

Peggy and Howard find the chamber with the Tesseract.

A gigantic tentacle creature emerges from the portal, and Red Skull laughs in triumph and declares that the champion of Hydra has risen. Peggy bursts in and Johann tells her that she's too late. The creature grabs and crushes Red Skull.

Bucky finds Steve nearby, manacled, and Steve tells Bucky to get him into the suit. They do so and hook the suit up to power it temporarily, Hydra Stomper falls over, and then then Steve flies through the ceiling to the Tesseract room.

The creature continues growing and wreaking havoc, and Peggy gets Howard to the controls to reverse the polarity of the portal and send the creature back. A tentacle pins Peggy to a wall, and she grabs a nearby sword and cuts herself free. As more tentacles pin Peggy down, Howard reverses the polarity and the creature is pulled back through the portal. Peggy anchors herself with the sword, and Steve blasts through the floor.

A tentacle slams him into a wall, and Peggy cuts him free. The soldiers arrive and open fire, and Steve joins them. The creature howls and deafens everyone, and Steve gets them out to safety then flies back in.

The creature holds the portal open so Howard can't close it, and Peggy shoves it back using her shield. Steve flies in and blasts the tentacles, but his suit runs out of power and crashes. Steve crawls out of the suit and tells Peggy to stop, and she tells him that she has to. Peggy tells Steve that they'll dance the next Saturday night, then pushes the creature back through the portal and herself along with it. The portal closes and explodes, leaving the Tesseract on the floor. Steve kneels next to it, realizing that it's taken Peggy from him.

Now

A new portal opens due to the Tesseract and Peggy emerges from it. Nick Fury and Clint Barton are there, and Nick tells Peggy that the war has been over for over 70 years Peggy says that they'll be okay, because they won the war."

He uses a device to pull a force-field encased sphere to him. Korath and two of his men enter, aim their guns at Star Lord, and tell him to drop the sphere. Star Lord removes his mask revealing that he's Prince T'Challa of Earth, and Korath says that he's a huge fan of Star Lord.

Korath tells has men to stand down, saying that it's the Star Lord, the legendary outlaw who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, and admits that he would like to join the Ravagers. The alien regrets that he has to take the sphere from T'Challa, and offers to fight him without his gun. T'Challa tells him to use it, and fights Korath barehanded. He suckers Korath into hitting the charged force field, and Korath is stunned unconscious. The two men open fire on T'Challa, who dodges their blasts, takes cover, and uses his device to stun them.

T'Challa runs outside with Korath, and finds more soldiers waiting. He tells them that as a Ravager, he's never alone. Yondu uses his Yakka arrow to kill the soldiers, and T'Challa shows him the sphere. The Ravager jokingly says that they could sell, it, and T'Challa figures it'd be put to better use jumpstarting a race's star. Their ship lands nearby, and they board and depart.

Earth, Wakanda: 1988

A young T'Challa tells his father, Baba, that he wants to go out to see the world. Baba warns him that the world is full of war and hatred, and has nothing to offer Wakanda. He understands that T'Challa has the heart of an explorer, but warns that all T'Challa will find if he goes there will be pain and destruction.

Later, T'Challa throws his spear outside of the nation's force field and goes out to retrieve it. A Ravager ship arrives on Earth to abduct the child of Ego, and Yondu sends Kraglin and Taserface to get the child. They take T'Challa by mistake and bring him to Yondu, who realizes their error. The two Ravagers explain that they detected cosmic energy, and T'Challa explains that his home is built on Vibranium. When T'Challa says that he was out exploring, Yondu invites him to explore a galaxy's worth of worlds.

20 Years Later

T'Challa and the other Ravagers go to a planet and drink, initiating their new member Korath. Thanos, a Ravager, joins them, and explains that T'Challa showed him there's more than one way to reallocate the galaxy's resources. T'Challa goes to the bar and buys a drink from the bartender, Drax. When Drax realizes that T'Challa saved his homeworld, along with Drax's wife and children, he's happy to meet T'Challa. Nebula, all gussied up, joins them and says that T'Challa looks pretty good to her.

T'Challa and Nebula grab a table to have a drink, and T'Challa suggests that she talk to her father, Thanos. Nebula refuses, figure that he hasn't changed, and asks if he's ever considered going back to Wakanda. T'Challa explains that Yondu tried to take him back when T'Challa was young, but Wakanda had been destroyed in a senseless war like Baba warned T'Challa about. Nebula figures that T'Challa saves homes because he lost his own, and tells him that she has a job for him.

Later, Nebula briefs the Ravagers on the Embers of Genesis, that can terraform entire ecosystems. With the Embers they could eradicate hunger across the galaxy. The Collector has the Embers, and he's the most ruthless kingpin in the intergalactic underworld. He took over when Thanos went straight. Yondu warns T'Challa that the mission is suicide, and says that the Ravagers aren't going.

T'Challa talks to Yondu privately and says that Ravagers don't back down from a fight. Yondu reluctantly gives in, and they go to the mining colony of Knowhere where the Collector has his base. The Black Order is working security for Collector, and Nebula and Yondu go in posing as sellers of the sphere. T'Challa is inside the case they're carrying, and Proxima Midnight is running security. She scans the case, while Korath and Thanos start a fight outside. The Black Guards check it out, including Midnight, while T'Challa emerges from the case and goes to search for the Embers. At least, that's the plan.

Nebula and Yondu get into to see Collector. Meanwhile, T'Challa searches the collection, which is bigger than he anticipated. He finds Howard the Duck and asks the captive if he knows where the Embers are. Howard can barely describe where they are verbally, and T'Challa shoots the lock off of his container and takes Howard with him.

The Ravagers fight their staged fight until Midnight, use an energy blast from her staff to paralyze them. She recognizes them and realizes that it's a diversion, and sounds the alarms.

Howard stops to get a drink, and the alarms go off and the doors seal off. T'Challa gets out just in time, and his necklace from Earth glows. A nearby Wakanda shuttle on display activates, and T'Challa boards it. There are dummies of Wakandan pilots onboard, and a hologram of Baba activates when T'Challa speaks.

Bama talks about how his son T'Challa was abducted, and asks for anyone with information about the boy's whereabouts should respond to the homing beacon. Baba then says that in case T'Challa is listening, that they will search every world until they find T'Challa.

Nebula comes in and holds a gun on T'Challa. Collector is with her, holding Yondu prisoner, and Nebula says that she owed Collector a debt and T'Challa was the payment.

T'Challa is tossed in a cell with the other prisoners, and Korath figures that T'Challa plans an escape Instead, T'Challa grabs Yondu and says that he lied to him about Wakanda's destruction. Yondu insists that he was protecting T'Challa, and T'Challa is just like him. T'Challa says that he's nothing like Yondu, and Yondu tells him that he's an explorer and the past is nothing but a prison. When Yondu says that the Ravagers are T'Challa's family, T'Challa tells him that the Ravagers aren't his family and never were.

Ebony Maw comes and takes T'Challa to Collector. Collector puts T'Challa in a containment cell and plans to use him to decorate a wall. Unimpressed, Collector tells his minions to dissect T'Challa.

Nebula goes to the Ravagers' cell, and she shoots Ebony Maw dead and says that she's there to rescue them. She explains that the entire thing was her plan, and she told T'Challa about it from the beginning. It was T'Challa's idea to keep them in the dark, because he knew Yondu would never let T'Challa walk into a trap, and T'Challa being captured gave her the opportunity to steal the Embers.

T'Challa uses his necklace to break out of the cell, and Carina turns against her superior and shoots him from behind. As T'Challa runs through the containment cells, Collector uses the weapons in the collection against T'Challa.

The Ravagers run with the Black Order following them, and Thanos tells the others to go on while he attacks their pursuers alone. Thanos fights the Black Order brawler, Black Dwarf, When Midnight joins the fight and wounds Thanos, Nebula turns to watch.

Collector tells T'Challa that his new family has abandoned him. Yondu returns and uses his arrow to knock off the helm that Collector is using. Collector grabs and snaps the arrow when Yondu sends it at him.

Midnight and Dwarf beat Thanos down, and Midnight prepares to kill him. Nebula arrives and shoots Midnight, and Dwarf grabs Nebula and she feeds him the Embers. They grow within him, and Thanos and Nebula run and jump aboard the Ravager ship just as it lifts off. Nebula figures that Yondu and T'Challa are doing fine.

Collector beats Yondu, until T'Challa joins the fight. Yondu gets close enough to Collector to steal his control bracelet, and T'Challa uses it to open a cell and knocks Collector inside, before sealing it shut. Collector vows to hunt them down, and they give the bracelet to Carina who uses it to free Collector's ""collection"". They're not happy with Collector.

T'Challa and Yondu fly out of Knowhere using the Wakandan shuttle, they head to the rendezvous to meet the others, and Yondu starts to apologize. His adopted son tells him that there's no need, because Yondu showed him the universe just like he wanted. T'Challa admits that he doesn't know where he belongs, and Yondu assures T'Challa that there's no place where he doesn't belong. He asks where T'Challa wants to be and brings up a hologram of Earth, and tells T'Challa to follow his heart.

The Ravagers go to Earth and Wakanda, and they go the throne room to meet Baba. T'Challa introduces his ""family"", and they have a celebration. Baba asks Yondu how T'Challa ended up with him, and T'Challa jumps in to say that he was lost and Yondu found him.

Peter Quill is working as a janitor at a Dairy Queen. As he cleans up after hours, Ego comes in and asks Peter if he can spare some time for his father."

Nick Fury is driving with Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, talking about the idea of the Avengers Initiative. She's surprised that Nick wants to bet the future of the Initiative on Tony Stark, who is sitting and eating donuts. Nick thinks that Tony has potential.

Nick calls Tony into the donut shop and they sit at a table. He says that Tony has become a problem that he has to deal with, and points out the poisonous veins on Tony's neck. Natasha injects Tony in the neck with lithium dioxide, and Nick explains that it will take the edge off of the poisoning. Tony gags and collapses, and Natasha confirms that Tony is dead.

Tuesday

Thor's hammer Mjolnir rests in a crater. Agent Phil Coulson of SHIELD calls Nick and reports that they found it, and the locals are getting curious. Nick is busy with something else, and tells Coulson to have his team set up a perimeter. Natasha is brought out of prison and insists that she didn't kill Tony. The SHIELD guards have Nick escort her to the transport truck and he who says that he believes that she's innocent but his hands are tied.

Nick slips Natasha an injector, and says that someone in SHIELD poisoned Tony so he needs her to escape and find out who. Nick escorts her to the transport and she gets in, and Nick watches the truck drive off. Inside Natasha escapes her handcuffs and knocks out her guards. The two men upfront hear the noise and stop the truck, and when they open the back doors they discover the guards unconscious and Natasha gone.

In Puente Antiguo, New Mexico, where the crater is, Nick and Clint Barton watch SHIELD scientists scan Mjolnir. Nick figures someone will come looking for it, and Coulson finds one of several guards down and sounds the alarms. Going to the command center, Nick tells Coulson to give him an update. Coulson spots the intruder that knocked out the guards and is knocking out more, and is impressed by Thor's ""great hair"".

Barton goes up on a crane-lifted platform and draws an arrow. Thor goes to Mjolnir and reaches for it, and Nick tells Barton to hold his fire. Barton shoots Thor in the chest, killing him. Barton says that he didn't shoot, and SHIELD security officers train their guns on him anyway. Nick arrives and points out that it's Barton's arrow in Thor's chest.

Later, Barton sits in a cell insisting he never slips and never misfires. Nick and Coulson watch him, and Nick has confirmed that Thor is almost a thousand years old. Going in, Nick approaches Barton and discovers that he's dead. Later Nick tells Coulson that Barton wouldn't have killed himself because he has a wife and kids, and figures whoever killed Stark killed Thor and Barton. Coulson points out that Barton was alone in a cell under observation, and there were no signs of a struggle. Nick admits that he has one idea of what connects them.

Wednesday

At Culver University in Virginia, Natasha approaches Betty Ross and she says that she hasn't seen ""him"". Natasha says that she's there about Tony, and believes that he was murdered. She shows Ross the injector Nick slipped her earlier, and explains that she needed someone to check it out outside of SHIELD.

Ross and Natasha go to Ross' lab, and Ross examines the injector. There's no trace of lethal pathogens, and the antidote didn't make it out of the syringe. A tiny projectile of some sort was fired from the needle, and Ross says that they're done. As Natasha leaves, she notices a pizza joint baseball cap. Ross claims that a student left it there. Nick calls Natasha and tells her that Barton is dead. Natasha asks who she kills, and Nick figures that the killer is going after the Initiative candidates. Bruce Banner and Natasha are the last two living candidates, and Nick tells her to hide after finding Banner.

Natasha notices Ross glancing at a door, and goes to it. Ross stops Natasha from opening the door, and Banner comes out and says that there's no need for violence. Natasha hears cars outside and says that they need to go.

At the SHIELD desert base, a beam of energy shoots down from the sky. An army of Asgardian soldiers materialize, Loki leading them. SHIELD assault soldiers arrive, and Nick steps out. Loki tells him to kneel before a god, and Nick's phone rings interrupting Loki's introductory speech.

Natasha leads Banner off and calls Nick, and soldiers surround them. General Ross tells his men to move on his mark.

Nick finally answers his phone, and Natasha tells him what's going on. He tells Natasha to deal with it and hangs up, and Loki says that vengeance brought him there.

Natasha introduces herself to the soldiers, says that she has Banner in her custody, and tells them to stand down. Someone sniper shoots Banner in the shoulder, but all of Ross' soldiers report that they didn't shoot.

Loki brings out an energy-charged box.

Banner tells Natasha to run as his eyes turn green.

When Nick asks what's in the box, Loki says that he will take Earth as retribution for Nick's insolence.

Banner turns into Hulk and Natasha runs. Ross has his men open fire.

Loki releases a blast of energy from the box, freezing the SHIELD assault officers.

Hulk smashes the soldier's vehicles. He throws a jeep at Natasha, who dodges, then grabs Ross as she runs to her father. Meanwhile, Hulk swells up and explodes.

Nick tells Loki that what he's doing won't bring Thor back. Lady Sif tells Loki to stop, agreeing with Nick, and Nick tells Loki that they have the same enemy: the person who killed Thor also killed Tony and Barton. He assures Loki that when he finds Thor's killer, Loki will have his vengeance. Loki gives him until the next sunrise to deliver his brother's assassin.

At a public library in Manassas, Virginia, Natasha accesses a computer and calls Coulson to get his SHIELD password because she's locked out of the system. He finally gives it to her, and Natasha hears someone moving behind her. She looks, but there's no one there. Natasha brings up a file on Hope Van Dyne, and confirms that she accessed the database the day before.

Natasha calls Nick, but then hears the person behind her again. She turns to face him, and tells him he won't win against SHIELD or her. Her attacker easily throws Natasha around, and she tries to reach her dropped phone to leave message on Nick's voicemail, but is pulled away by her attacker, yelling that it's all about Hope.

Later at a diner in the nearby town, Nick listens to Natasha's message. Coulson tells Nick that there's four hours until sunrise, and says that Nick is the only Initiative candidate still alive. Nick says that he's not the only Avenger left, goes out to his car, takes a signal device out of the glove compartment, and tells Coulson that it's their last hope. He has an idea about Hope, then puts the device back in the glove compartment and goes to meet with Loki.

Nick drives to the ice palace Loki has set up, and confronts the Destroyer on guard.

Thursday

In a graveyard in San Francisco, Nick goes to the tombstone of Hope Van Dyne, and hears someone behind him. Nick calls to Hank Pym, who steps out of the fog in his Yellow Jacket armor. Hank says Nick has no right to come there and stand over Hope's grave, and Hank says that Hope is dead because SHIELD killed her, and died because of Nick.

Nick says that Hope was killed on a mission, and Hank points out that Hope was his daughter and Nick exploited her grief for her mother. Because Hope died like her mother died, Hank murdered the others so he could destroy everything Nick worked for. He killed Thor figuring Nick would recruit him, convincing Thor that he was a hero.

Yellow Jacket shrinks and attacks Nick, and Nick holds his own. He flips over Yellow Jacket, much to the killer's surprise, then punches Yellow Jacket across the graveyard. When Yellow Jacket comes at him, Nick slaps him down and disappears, then reappears and taunts Yellow Jacket.

Yellow Jacket blasts Nick, who disappears and reappears behind the killer. He teleports away from Yellow Jacket's attacks, then an army of Nick's appear. Yellow Jacket flies up, but a giant Nick appears behind him and an icicle grows up from below, encasing Yellow Jacket. Yellow Jacket falls to the ground, and the Nicks laugh at him. They turn into Loki, who drops his multiple illusions.

Nick joins Loki, and Nick tells Hank that SHIELD is people willing to give their lives for something greater than themselves, to save the world from men like Hank. After Nick removes the power pack from the suit, Loki's soldiers capture Hank. As the soldiers take Hank away, Hank tells Nick to honor Hope. Loki tells Nick that it was a pleasure, and Nick tells him to get off the planet. The Asgardian says that he might stay on Earth for a while.

Friday

At the UN Building, Loki and his soldiers enter the building and Loki says that the nations of Earth have set aside their differences and united under his command. His words are broadcast across the planet as Loki says that humans crave domination and were made to be ruled.

At a hangar, Nick and Coulson look at the coffins of the six victims. Nick says that the would-be Avengers may rest in peace, but they won't. He tells Coulson that the Avengers were meant to be an affirmation of humanity's strength, and goes to a piece of an iceberg containing Captain America. Captive Marvel arrives and asks where the fight is."

As they drive, Christine asks Stephen to say the speech he's giving later at an award ceremony for the procedure he performed in surgery. She tells Stephen to rush the podium, screaming and cheering, Stephen swerves around a truck and brakes to avoid an oncoming car. He manages to brake, but another car slams into them from behind and knocks them off the highway.

When the car lands, Stephen lives but realizes that Christine is dead. He travels the world searching the mystic arts for a way to bring Christine back, and gains the Eye of Agamotto which supposedly can alter timelines. Wong and the Ancient One warn Stephen that tampering with time can destroy the universe, and they protect reality rather than threaten it.

The Ancient One still died and Stephen bargains with Dormammu, but Stephen can't let go of the past. Two years after Christine's death, Stephen is in his Sanctum with Wong. Wong notices that Stephen has the Eye, but says nothing and goes to the kitchen and advises Stephen not to do something reckless. Once he's alone, Stephen puts on the Eye and uses it to travel back through time to the point where he picked up Christine on the night she died.

The accident happens as before despite Stephen's efforts, and Christine still dies. He uses the Eye to rewind time and takes a different route, but another car slams into them and Christine dies. No matter what Stephen does, Christine dies of one cause or another

Watcher: In this universe, Stephen Strange didn't lose his hands, but his heart. Even Stephen avoids picking up Christine, she dies in a fire. He goes back and meets Christine, and wonders if they're allowed to be happy. Christine drives and they're knocked off the road by another car again, and Christine dies.

Stephen crawls from the wreckage, and screams in anguish. The Ancient One appears and says that she's there to help him. She says that Stephen ill seek answers in the mystic arts and in her, and says that Christine's death is an absolute and unchangeable point in time. Without Christine's death, Stephen would never have become the Sorcerer Supreme. The Ancient One says that Stephen is risking the universe, and Stephen figures that all he needs is more power. She tells Stephen to stop torturing himself, and he can't save Christine. The Ancient One says that the path he's on only leads to darkness and the end of reality.

When Stephen refuses to stop, the Ancient One unleashes a blast of energy. Later Stephen enters a jungle looking for the lost library of Cagliostro. He comes across a man, O'Bengh, who walks away without a word. Stephen follows him to a nearby temple, and Stephen teleports in. Glowing sigils appear and drop Stephen into a cave. O'Bengh comes up, and says that he's the librarian for Cagliostro's books.

O'Bengh takes Stephen to a chamber with the books, and says that a sorcerer can gain the necessary power by absorbing the energy of other beings. Stephen summons a massive tentacle creature and asks if it can share some of its power with him. The creature attacks Stephen, and O'Bengh tends to Stephen afterward. He asks if Christine is worth the pain, and warns that love can break a person's mind. With that, O'Bengh leaves.

Stephen soon realizes that he has to take the power he wants. He takes a Cloak of Levitation from one creature he summons, and absorbs dozens of others.

The Watcher secretly watches, realizing Stephen is on the wrong path. However, the Watcher won't risk the safety of all the other universes. The being also figures that Stephen wouldn't listen.

Once Stephen has enough power, he summons the tentacled creature and absorbs it as well.

Stephen goes to O'Bengh, who is now old and dying. He refuses to let Stephen restore his youth. When Stephen says that he can't accept that, O'Bengh hopes that the other Stephen will. O'Bengh tells Stephen that he is only half a man.

Centuries ago, on the second anniversary of Christine's death, Stephen sets aside the Eye and decides to stop living in the past. He goes out and sees the world dissolving, the people along with it. The Ancient One appears, says that she's an ""echo"", and warns that they don't have much time. She tells Stephen that he's causing the destruction, when another version of him used the Eye and vanished into the past where she couldn't follow.

When the Ancient One attacked Stephen earlier, she caused two his possible timelines to exist in one universe. She warns that if the other Stephen succeeds in reversing an absolute point in their universe, the paradox will destroy their universe. The Ancient One says that the only sorcerer strong enough to stop the other Stephen is Stephen.

Stephen returns to the Sanctum and tells Wong what is happening. Wong asks if Stephen wants to stop his counterpart, and Stephen says that he has to. When Wong casts a protection spell on him, Stephen accepts it and is teleported away by the other Stephen.

Stephen is imprisoned in a magic circle, and the dark Stephen steps out of the shadows and says that they are one and the same. He says that they knew and loved Christine, and Stephen tells his counterpart that he can't bring Christine back. Dark Stephen says that he sacrificed everything for Christine, and they have to save her together.

Dark Stephen teleports Stephen to the car wreck, and says that their powers are divided but once they become whole again, they can save Christine. Stephen says that they can't and repeats the Ancient One's, and Dark Stephen insists that the Ancient One doesn't understand. Despite that, Stephen says it's arrogance, not love.

The spell protects Stephen from Dark Stephen's initial attack. The two sorcerers fight, as do their Cloaks. Stephen casts his most powerful spell, but Dark Stephen survives and pulls his counterpart into the shadows. Christine appears and says that they can be together again, but Stephen remembers the world dissolving and pulls away. Dark Stephen drops the illusion and attacks Stephen. He ends the protection spell and takes Stephen's power, and uses the power to bring Christine back.

Christine recoils in terror at the sight of Dark Stephen, transformed into a demonic being by the power he's absorbed. She starts to dissolve, and he uses all of his magic to hold back the dissolution. The Watcher appears outside the protective bubble, and Stephen asks him to stop the dissolution. Stephen admits that he was wrong, and the world shouldn't suffer for his arrogance. The Watcher says that he would punish Stephen if he could, but he can't interfere because it will cause more destruction.

The Watcher departs and the universe ends. Stephen creates a protective shell, but Christine dissolves in his hands. He collapses in grief, saying that he's sorry."

They are beaten down by shadowed figures who turn out to be murderous zombie versions of Iron Man, Wong and Stephen Strange. He is rescued from their attack by the Wasp and Spider-Man, assisted by Dr Strange's sentient Cloak of Levitation. The Watcher reveals that Janet Van Dyne in the Quantum Realm was the source of the zombie infection and passed it to Hank Pym and Scott Lang when Pym tried to rescue her. Within 24 hours the West Coast of USA was infected and within two weeks it had spread from the Avengers to the whole planet. Peter Parker shows his orientation video about rules for surviving a zombie apocalypse. The other survivors include Happy Hogan, Kurt from Scott Lang's crew, Bucky Barnes, Sharon Carter and Okoye. They track a garbled message about a cure to Camp Lehigh, and try to use the rail system to reach there. At Grand Central Station they are attacked by zombies including Hawkeye and Falcon. Happy Hogan gets infected. Spider-Man and Wasp find ways to jump start a train. Zombie Captain America boards the train and infects Sharon Carter, who infects Hope Van Dyne before the Cap and Carter zombies are destroyed. Peter Parker shares his thoughts on staying upbeat despite your losses. They reach the vicinity of Camp Lehigh. Hope Van Dyne sacrifices her giant-sized self to get the others across a mass of zombies. The survivors discover that the Vision or more specifically his Mind Stone is the potential cure, demonstrated by the restoration of humanity to the reanimated head of Scott Lang, currently occupying a glass jar. It is revealed that Vision was keeping a zombie Wanda Maximoff on the base and feeding her the survivors who responded to the message, including a leg-amputated but living T'Challa. Bucky encounters a hungry Wanda; Kurt and Okoye fall to her. Scott Lang gets his mobility back from being carried by the Cloak of Levitation. Vision realizes he has to help the survivors take the Mind Stone to Wakanda to then use it to save the world. He removes it from his brow ending his artificial life. Wanda throws Bucky through the sky. Bruce Banner finally gets Hulk to come out to and fight Wanda while the last three fly a Quadjet from the base. The jet is briefly delayed by the zombie giant Hope, then heads for Wakanda. Peter Parker grieves and Scott and T'Challa offers words of comfort. The final scene and hints from the Watcher reveal that Wakanda is now occupied by the zombie plague, and by a zombie Thanos carrying a nearly complete Infinity Gauntlet. He lacks only the Mind Stone which the heroes are currently bringing towards him."

Tony takes on Killmonger as the replacement executive, then invests in Killmonger's combat drone project. Pepper Potts asks Colonel Rhodes to dig into why Killmonger is trying to get influence with Tony. Killmonger points Tony to black-market vibranium as a power source for the drones. He manipulates Rhodes to approach Ulysses Klaue to buy vibranium, despite Pepper's objections. Killmonger uses the meeting with Klaue to draw out T'Challa and kill him, and pin it on the murdered Rhodes. Klaue reveals he is Killmonger's partner in all this and hands off the vibranium.

A monitor goes off and Darcy wakes Jane, and Jane calls SHIELD and tries to talk to the director. She tries to explain that an alien invasion is imminent, but gets hung up on. Jane calls the Parks Department, while Darcy watches the energy approaching energy bolt. Jane joins her, as the energy burst shoots over the horizon and lands in Las Vegas, and Jane figures that they're too late and the invasion has begun.

The energy bridge slams down in Las Vegas, and Thor says that the residents' dull lives are about to come to an end. He steps forward and tells them to prepare to party, and the beings that came with Thor cheer. In this universe, Odin returned an infant Loki to the latter's people. Without Loki to keep Thor's life lively, Thro grew into a different prince than the one in the Sacred Timeline.

Earlier, on Asgard Odin goes into his Odinsleep. Thor and Frigga are at Odin's side, and once Odin is asleep Frigga goes off to her sister's to celebrate the solstice.

As Frigga and Thor leave, Frigga tells Thor to study because it will be his first taste of kinghood the Nine Realms that he will one day rule. She tells him ""no parties"" and Thor vaguely agrees. Frigga tells Thor that Heimdall will be watching and departs, Thor and his companions leave, and Thor says that Asgard will be fine without him or Odin. Thor gets tankards of mead and says that they're going to the backward planet of Earth to party.

In Las Vegas, Thor leads the party and the residents join in. Darcy and Jane arrive and Jane confirms that Thor was the first arrival. She's impressed by his looks and goes over to talk to him, and Darcy casually insults one of the visitors, Howard the Duck.

Thor is talking with some Skrulls, and Jane gets Thor's attention and introduces herself. When Thor says who he is, Jane finds it hard to believe he's the Norse God of Thunder. She asks him if he destroyed a star 18 months ago, and Thor cheerfully admits that they did at his last party. Thor sees her tablet and figures that Jane is a genius, and flatters her.

Howard approaches Darcy and asks if she wants some half-price nachos. She goes with him, insisting it's not a date.

Jane is soon dancing with Thor, and Grandmaster release the foam for the foam party. Soon, Darcy and Howard are married by an Elvis impostor, and Thor and Jane get paired tattoos

The next morning the partygoers pass out in a hotel suite. Jane is woken up by her phone, and when she ignores it there's a knock at the door. She answers it, and Maria Hill, the acting director of SHIELD, is there with her agents. Maria tells Jane to come with them, and points out that Jane was the first to warn them about the invasion. She hopes Jane will be the key to eliminating it.

Earlier, Nick Fury was knocked out by Korg jumping onto the fountain, making Marie the acting director.

Thor wakes up and Maria asks if Jane has company. Jane claims that Thor is a zoologist and tries to close the door, but Maria is having none of it.

The SHIELD agents bring Jane and Darcy to their helicarrier, and Jane tells Maria what happened. Agent Coulson tells Maria that the party atmosphere is spreading, led by Thor who has taken to the skies. Jane is angry that Thor left without telling her, and Maria has confirmed that Thor is in Paris. Agent Brock Rumlow says that the last resort has arrived, and opens his case to reveal a beeper. Maria activates it, and says that it's done.

Thor is in Paris taking selfies with other partygoers, and Loki and his bodyguard of Front Giants arrive. Loki and Thor cheerfully greet each other, and declare themselves brothers forever. A shooting star descends on Paris, and slams into the street near them. It's Captain Marvel, who tells Thor that they need to chat.

Marvel tells Thor to clean up the mess and leave Earth. He refuses and tells her to buzz off, and she punches him. Thor recovers and calls Marvel a party-pooper, and she punches Thor again, knocking him into the sky. He returns and hits her with Mjolnir, and he summons a windstorm and then hits Marvel again, knocking her to Stonehenge.

Thor follows her and tips over the stones. Marvel punches him and knocks him to the States, and flies after him. They fight across the globe and finally end up back in Paris. Thor pins Marvel down with Mjolnir and figures that she needs a timeout, and everyone calls Marvel a party-pooper.

Later, Marvel reports to Maria and tells her what happened. She explains that if she exerted her full powers, she'd blow a crater in the planet. Jane gets a call and steps aside to take it, and Thor asks when he can see her again. She asks Thor if he destroyed the planet, and Thor says that nobody got hurt. Maria calls Jane back, and Jane hangs up and goes back to the others. When Jane hears the others about blowing up Thor, she points out that he's a lughead but not a planetary threat. Maria tells Jane that her assistance is no longer required, and SHIELD agents drop Jane and Darcy off in Las Vegas. Howard comes over and complains about Darcy ditching him, while Jane calls Thor. Loki has the phone, while Thor and the others have late-night Chinese.

Before he can put Thor on, Loki drops the phone and it breaks. Darcy suggests that they call Thor's mother to stop the party, and Jane seizes on the idea.

The partygoers start wrecking havoc on the planet, and Marvel grabs a flying Thor.

In their camper, Jane and Darcy power up their equipment and they call to Heimdall. He pulls her to Asgard.

Marvel flies Thor into orbit and throws him down toward Earth.

Heimdall summons Jane to him, and then teleports her back to Earth.

Marvel flies down to confront Thor, while Maria tells her people in the nearby helicarrier to arm the nukes in case Marvel gets ""distracted by a cat"".

Jane finds herself at the party where Frigga is drinking with her sister and the other gusts.

Thor tells Marvel to loosen up. Marvel gives him a countdown.

Jane drinks wine and tells Frigga that Thor is in trouble on Earth. Frigga projects her image to Earth, interrupting his fight with Marvel, and demands to know what he's doing. The goddess says that she had a visitor, and Jane is worried about Thor. Thor claims that his ""study group"" came to Earth for a cultural exchange, and Frigga tells her son that she's coming to Earth to see his studies for himself.

Maria tells her people to stand down.

Marvel tells Thor that she almost feels bad for him, tells him to start cleaning, and flies off.

At the party, Frigga tells the others that she has to leave.

Thor flies back to the party and asks Loki for help, and warns that his mother is coming. Loki leaves with his giant retinue, not seeing that it's his problem, Thor tells the partygoers that the party is over and they have to stay and clean up. They all dismiss Thor as a party-pooper and leave, Thor soars into the air and says in a commanding voice that the partygoers will listen to him, and his mother is coming and really mad., and they help clean up.

Frigga arrives on Earth and find Thor and the partygoers studying. Marvel arrives with a tablet of information, and says that Thor requested it. Frigga thanks Marvel for helping ""educate"" her son, and Thor summons his decorated hammer and prepares to leave with Frigga.

Thor pays a visit to Jane and brings flowers, and says that she did the right thing by calling Frigga in, even it wasn't the cool thing. He says that he'll call her, and Jane tells Thor to ask him out on a date. Thor does, inviting her to a planet full of unicorns, and Jane accepts and goes back into the camper.

As Thor walks away, an army of robots teleport in. Their leader is Ultron in Vision's body, and wields the Infinity Stones."

Drones fly out of the sky after her, and Natasha sets a ninety-second timer on her wristwatch. Clint Barton steps out and shoots the Ultron drones, bringing them down. He continues shooting at Natasha's pursuers, and Natasha takes evasive action through the ruins.

The drones spot Clint and land on the building he's on, and the cloaked Clint drives arrows through their heads and takes them on using both his bow and hand-to-hand. More drones arrive, and Natasha warns Clint that they have 30 seconds until the drones' signal reconnect with the hive. She jumps off her bike and fights the drones hand-to-hand, and takes them out with 18 seconds to spare.

The last two drones on the roof destroy Clint's cybernetic right arm and knock him off the building. As they prepare to kill him, Natasha drives up and takes them out. Natasha offers Clint his severed arm and points out a nearby building, and figures the secret to taking out Ultron is there.

In the past, Tony Stark uses the Mind Stone to create Ultron. Ultron tried to create peace by eliminating all life, and all he needed to succeed was an organic body. In the current universe, Ultron acquired Vision's body, merged his mind with it, and used the Mind Stone to lay waste to Earth. Ultron killed Iron Man and the others, while Black Widow and Hawkeye tried to stop Ultron from launching missiles with the nuclear codes. They failed, and could only watch from their Quinjet as the missiles hit the planet and wiped out all life.

Thanos arrives on Earth and Ultron easily kills him, and then takes Thanos' other five Stones. Ultron takes the Stones, merges them into his body, and sees everything. The AI creates its Sentry drones and travels to every planet in its universe, bringing about ""peace"" by wiping out all life in them.

On Xandar, Captain Marvel fights Ultron. However, the Stones are too powerful and Ultron kills the heroine and blows up the planet. When all life in the universe is destroyed, Ultron senses Watcher and realizes that there are universe beyond its own. Watcher temporarily blocks Ultron's senses, but Ultron vows to find the being and destroy it and all life in other universes. Meanwhile, Watcher vows that he will destroy Ultron and there is still one last hope for the universe.

In the present, Natasha and Clint enter the building containing the KGB archives and they start going through the boxes of paper. As they go through hundreds of boxes, an invisible Watcher with them sees a nearby one with a file for Arnim Zola, and wonders if he should intervene. Ultron nears, and Clint finds the file on Zola but dismisses it without reading it and dismisses their search as pointless.

Natasha tells Clint that they need an AI that can combat Ultron's code. She says that they'll find it, but it takes time, Clint wonders if there's anything left worth fighting for, but Natasha figures they can combat Ultron with an analog code. She finds the file and finds it, and it says that Zola is in an old HYDRA base in Siberia.

Ultron finds Watcher in his vantage point beyond the multiverse, blasts the being, and says that all of the universes with all of their chaos must be silenced. Watcher tells Ultron that it doesn't have to do it, and it says that it's its purpose as it flies as Watcher.

Natasha and Clint travel to the base in Siberia, go in, and Natasha tells her partner that before he died, Zola uploaded his brain to a series of data banks. The one she and Rogers found at Lehigh was destroyed, but HYDRA kept another data bank in Siberia to supervise the Russian Super Soldier program. Natasha brings Zola online, and Natasha tells it that they need its help. Clint tells the Ai that Hydra and SHIELD are dead, along with everyone else due to Ultron.

Zola figures they want it to dismantle Ultron's code from the inside, and Zola wonders why it should. Clint threatens to destroy the databank if Zola doesn't cooperate, and the AI gives in. They call Ultron at Avengers HQ and Clint downloads the AI into one of his arrows. They're going to upload Zola via a Sentry since Ultron is offworld, and they destroy the databank once Zola is clear of it.

The Sentries arrive and find the fire, and Clint shoots one Sentry with the download arrow. Natasha attacks the other Sentries, using Captain America's shield that she found in the archives. Clint shoot down Sentries, and Natasha pulls the first Sentry into the chamber and Clint seals the door behind her. Zola infiltrates the Sentry and takes it over as the other Sentries start to break through, and Natasha shoots the Sentry down so Zola can't use it to betray them.

Zola connects to the hive and unleashes a signal blast. The Sentries continue trying to break through, and Zola tells the heroes that the hive mind is out of range. The heroes climb up and the Sentries fly in and come after them. Clint fires a force field arrow, blocking their pursuit, but the Sentries manages to blast though it and hit Clint.

Natasha grabs Clint, while Zola fires at the Sentries shooting at them. Cliff tells Natasha that he doesn't want to fight any more because he's tired, and the Sentries break through the barrier. He lets go of Natasha's hand and falls backward, shooting an explosive arrow as he goes. Natasha climbs out with Zola and gets clear just in time. As she drops to her knees in grief, Zola tells her that they should keep moving since more Sentries are likely on their way , and figures that Ultron is in a different universe.

Watcher and Ultron fight, and Ultron knocks his opponent out of his vantage point and down to a nearby planet. When Watcher insists that he swore an oath to not intervene, Ultron insists that it will bring peace and Watcher lacks the will to stop it. The two fight, falling through the multiverse, and Ultron beats Watcher. Watcher manages to break free and flees thorough the multiverse, but Ultron figures that no one can stop it now.

Later, the dark Strange finds Watcher in his cell within his destroyed universe, and Watcher admits that he's out of options. Strange asks Watcher if he's ready to break his oath, and Watcher tells Strange that he needs his help."

Peggy accepts the challenge and they fight, and she stops to point out Watcher behind Batroc. Watcher tells Peggy that she has been chosen.

Shuri, Pepper, and a group of Dona lead an assault on Killmonger. Meanwhile, Watcher approaches Killmonger, in the Black Panther costume, and tells him that he's been chosen. The assault squad breaks into the chamber seconds later, only to discover that Killmonger is gone.

On another Earth in Las Vegas, Thor fights Ultron sentries. Thor smashes them, and Watcher appears to him and says that he's been chosen. Watcher teleports Thor and the others to a pub, based on the one Peggy knows. Dark Strange is there, and tells Peggy that he constructed the place on the one he read in her biography. Watcher appears, and tells the group that they've been chosen for a mission that is both highly dangerous and absolutely necessary for the continuation of life as they know it. He explains that the mission needs a team, and they're the one hope to save every universe. They are the Guardians of the Multiverse.

Thor figures that the whole thing is a joke set up by Loki, and goes out the door only to find out the pub is hanging in a void. Thor pulls himself back in, and Watcher tells them that their world are under attack by Ultron or soon will be. Ultron has become a cosmic being because of the Infinity Stones it wields and Strange and Watcher figure the only way to stop Ultron is to separate him from the Stones. Killmonger figures that it's a suicide mission, while Thor wants Chinese takeout.

The Guardians come up with a plan, and Gamora shows them her Infinity Crusher that she used on the Stones in her universe. They'll get the Soul Stone and hold Ultron off, while Gamora crushes the Stone.

Strange teleports them to a world bereft of intelligent life and thus not worth Ultron's attention. He tells Peggy that in his universe, Steve Rogers received the serum. Meanwhile, Killmonger examines a sentry head. Strange summons drinks for everyone and proposes a long toast to possible death. T'Challa interrupts him to offer a toast to the Guardians.

Thor inadvertently attracts Ultron's attention and manifests, and then arrives through a dimensional rift. Strange summons magical armor for the Guardian. Watcher summons a portal for Killmonger and Gamora to leave, and Thor attacks Ultron. Ultron shrugs off Thor's lightning bolts and destroys the mountain the Guardians are standing on and leaves, assuming they're dead.

The Guardians emerge from the rubble, protected by Strange's magic. Thor and Strange launch an attack on Ultron, while T'Challa and Peggy fly up to the robot and Peggy slams into Ultron. She returns to the others by holding onto Thor's hammer as it returns to his hand, and Ultron blasts T'Challa away. Peggy goes to get T'Challa, and he confirms that he grabbed the Soul Stone from Ultron when he grappled briefly with him.

Strange launches a magical attack at Ultron, who discovers that the Soul Stone is gone. The sorcerer summons a horde of zombies to bury Ultron, while the Guardians depart through one of Watcher's portals. The zombie Scarlet Witch attacks Ultron as the robot frees itself, and Ultron blows up it and the planet as well.

The Guardians arrive at the planet where Gamora and Killmonger went earlier. They toss Gamora the stone, but a motorcycle-riding Natasha grabs it. Peggy tells the others to stand down, who is the last person on the planet. Speaking quickly, Peggy explains who they are and what they're doing, and knows Natasha's background from the one in her universe.

Natasha relents, just as Ultron arrives and tells them to give it the Stone. It pulls Natasha and the Stone up to it, the Guardians attack. The Stone bounces free, and Strange grabs Ultron's next blast and casually swallows it. T'Challa knocks Ultron down and shoots it repeatedly. Ultron blasts T'Challa away, and Peggy and Natasha strike at Ultron and keep it off-balance. All of the Guardians strike at Ultron, keeping him away from the Soul Stone, but he finally manages to blast them back and recover the Soul Stone.

Strange tries to stop Ultron, but Ultron shrugs him away, inserts the Soul Stone into his body, and grows to gigantic size. The sorcerer unleashes the power of all the creatures within him, pulling Ultron down and knocking the Stone free. Gamora grabs it, while the others try to contain Ultron. They hold it while Gamora unleashes the Crusher on Ultron, and it pries the other Stones loose.

The Stones' energy is released, and Ultron tells the Guardians that each universe is slightly different. Gamora realizes the Crusher was designed to destroy the Stones in her universe, not Ultron's. Ultron emerges from the destruction, blasts the planet, and realizes that defeating Strange is key. The robot blasts Natasha and Peggy away, and Natasha lands her motorcycle with Hawkeye's arrow with the Zola AI in it.

Natasha mounts up on her motorcycle and tells Peggy that she has an idea, but will need distance and a clear target. As the other Guardians resist Ultron's power, Natasha and Peggy approach Ultron and Natasha drives up through a nearby building. She uses Hawkeye's bow to fire the arrow into Ultron, while Peggy leaps onto Ultron and holds its head up so the arrow enters his eye.

The energy backlash knocks Peggy off and she falls to the ruins below. Zola is in Ultron's body, and in Ultron's mindscape Zola says that his objective is to end Ultron. Ultron goes inert and falls to the ruins, and Killmonger uses the sentry head to absorb Ultron's power into the head, along with the Stones. He then dons Ultron's armor.

Killmonger tells the others that with the Stones, they could fix their worlds and their lives. He tells them what they can all have. They refuse, and Killmonger unleashes a blast of energy. Zola in Ultron's body tells Killmonger that the suit belongs to him, and pulls the Stones to him. Killmonger telekinetically pulls them back, and Strange realizes that they were never meant to win but to separate the Stones from the body. He creates a pocket universe and Watcher lends his power to the effort.

Later, Strange meets with Watcher and figures that Watcher anticipated everything, from the failure of the Crusher to Killmonger's betrayal. Ultron and Zola are in the pocket dimension in Strange's hand, and Watcher says that someone needs to attend to them. Strange agrees to watch them.

Back at the pub, Watcher tells the Guardians that the entire multiverse owes them a debt of gratitude but will never know of their efforts. They go back to the exact moment they left. Peggy hesitates and looks at the photo of Steve on the pub wall, and Watcher tells her that it's time to go. Watcher figures that she would rather return to another time, and says that world and time needs Peggy. Natasha nods to Peggy, who smiles and leaves the pub.

Natasha says that she won't go back, and her world is gone. She says that they're just stories to Watcher, who only watches, and he says that they're more than that to him. He says that their stories are everything to him, and Natasha asks him to fix her world if what he says is true. Watcher says that he can't, and he gestures. The pub disappears, putting them on a helicarrier with Captains America and Marvel fighting the enemy Asgardians.

Watcher tells Natasha that they're on a world that lost its Black Widow, and Natasha thanks Watcher for bringing her there. Loki knocks Fury down and tells him that it's time that Fury tell him his secrets. Natasha arrives and kicks Loki down, grabs his staff, and puts it to Loki's chest. He goes unconscious, and Fury tells Natasha that he has his Natasha's spirit.

T'Challa and Peter fight together on their world.

Gamora fights alongside Tony.

Thor and Jane are reunited.

Watcher says that every story and every world is his home... and he will protect it to the end.

Peggy is returned to her fight with Batroc. Natasha takes Batroc down from behind, and Peggy hugs her. They go to the cargo hold which holds what the pirate were after: the Hydra Stomper from World War II. Natasha tells Peggy that there's someone inside."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3696750/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"Someone is killing off potential Librarians and it's up to Flynn Carsen and his new Guardian, Colonel Eve Baird, to save the three that are left.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Dean Devlin'],"['', '', '']",[],"['crown', 'sundial', 'code', 'solstice', 'artifact', 'magic', 'sword', 'ninja', 'reference to king arthur', 'excalibur']",[],"In Berlin, Colonel Eve Baird of NATO and her team are tracking terrorists through a warehouse when she encounters Flynn Carsen, who rolls out of a wall. As Eve tries to disarm a nuclear bomb from the terrorists, Flynn works on disarming a magical safe left by the Nazi Occult Division, which is hiding the Opal of Samara, a magical gem that can summon demons, but not control them. Using a wide range of obscure knowledge, Flynn solves the safe, helps Eve disarm the bomb, introduces himself as The Librarian, and then vanishes while Eve is dealing with the terrorists.

Back in the United States, Flynn receives a call from Jonas Sheir, a man who knows about The Library and says that he's coming to meet with Flynn. However, as he makes his way through the lobby of the Metropolitan Library, he's fatally stabbed by another man, who says, ""the crown is mine"". One of the pieces of paper the man was holding drifts away--a print out of a painting.

Meanwhile, Eve has been told to take a month of leave after giving an accurate but difficult to believe report to her superiors about the events in Berlin. As she tries to figure out what to do with her time, an invitation to interview with the Library arrives, the text magically appearing on it much like it did for Flynn in the first movie. When she heads to the Library, hoping it will lead her to Flynn and answers, she meets Charlene, who tells her that the Library has chosen her to be Flynn's Guardian. As Flynn hasn't had a Guardian in ten years, when Nicole Noone was lost, Charlene warns Eve that Flynn will make a fuss, but even he can't argue with the Library. As Charlene explains the world of magic to Eve, she takes her down the impossible elevator, to the Library.

As Eve tries to take in the expansive, magic-filled space, Flynn makes his entrance, parrying with Excalibur. When Cal perceives Eve as a potential threat, he flies towards her throat, stopping just short of cutting her, but is called off--a good thing, as wounds from Excalibur never heal. When Charlene introduces Eve as his new Guardian, Flynn protests thoroughly that he doesn't need a Guardian, then runs away when Eve tries to get him to explain further. She follows, and encounters Judson, whose spirit lives on and can communicate with them through a mirror. He's more willing to explain the situation to Eve than Flynn had been, letting her know that the Guardian's role is that of a partner and bodyguard, as Librarians tend to die. Judson also tells her that Flynn has survived longer than any other Librarian, mostly without a Guardian, and that the experience has changed him. Eve protests that she already has a job, hunting terrorists, and Judson points out that the role of Guardian is the same line of work. He also reminds her that the Library chose her, specifically, to be the Guardian.

Meanwhile, Flynn is investigating the murder of noted archaeologist Dr. Jonas Sheir, right on the doorstep of the Library. He hasn't been able to figure out what the painting on the paper Sheir had been holding, or how Sheir knew about the Library. When Eve suggests that Sheir might have gotten a glowing envelope by mistake, Flynn realizes that Sheir was an alternate candidate for The Librarian position ten years ago, when Flynn got the job. He and Eve look up other candidates to discover that nearly all of them have been killed, or died under mysterious circumstances. Someone is killing potential Librarians, and the only ones who remain are three candidates who ignored the invitations.

Flynn prepares to take off and find the remaining potential Librarians before their enemies do, brushing off Eve when she points out that having a partner along isn't a bad thing. He tells her that he's had partners in the past, and they've either left him or died.

Nonetheless, Eve follows him to New York, where they find Cassandra Cillian. Cassandra is a genius, working as a cleaner in a hospital. When she realizes that the doctors have misidentified medical symptoms, she and Flynn convince them to switch the diagnosis, but she's quickly overwhelmed by her synesthesia--a condition that produces auditory and sensory hallucinations linked to memory retrieval. For Cassandra, numbers appear as colours, science as musical notes, and math as scents--mostly food. Flynn tells her that she's in danger, and that she needs to come with them; he and Eve split up to find the remaining two candidates.

At a museum in Geneva, Flynn retrieves Ezekiel Jones, a thief that Flynn finds particularly irritating. Flynn saves Ezekiel from an assassin disguised as a guard, and Ezekiel recognizes him from a museum in Cairo, where Flynn had been trying to convince the museum that an artifact was cursed, while Ezekiel was there to steal the jewels. When Ezekiel accidentally sets off the museum alarms while trying to steal a jewelled dagger, bringing guards running to their location, Flynn offers him both a way out and the opportunity to find out who is trying to kill him.

Meanwhile, at Duke's Country Bar & Grill in Oklahoma, oil rigger and expert art historian Jacob Stone flirts with a mysterious woman, who has a tattoo of a snake and a Latin translation of lines from ""The Second Coming"", a Yeats poem about the apocalypse. When he translates the poem, after playing dumb for a moment and checking to make sure no one's watching, she introduces herself as Lamia and calls him by name, then kicks him to the ground and pulls out a sword. Eve steps in to prevent Lamia from killing him, and the bar is quickly swarmed by ninjas, starting an all-out bar brawl. Eve holds off Lamia and pulls Jacob to safety. As they drive away, Jacob once again tries to play dumb, but Eve calls him out on it, letting him know that she knows he's got an IQ of 190 and has been writing literature on art history for 20 years under an assumed name.

Back at the Library, Flynn gives the newcomers a basic breakdown of The Library and its greatest hits before Eve asks them each about the envelope they'd received ten years prior. Cassandra says that she was in the hospital, and Flynn reveals that she has a tumor--the reason that all five of her senses are involved with her synesthesia. She tells everyone that the tumor is about the size of a grape, and it sits right in her frontal lobe, but she's not dying--yet. When asked why they didn't come for an interview, Stone says that he already had a job in the family business. Ezekiel says he threw his out, assuming it was a mistake. He's been thief since he was a kid, so why would he be invited to work at a Library? Apparently unimpressed by the fact that magic is real, Ezekiel tells them that he's only there to find out who was trying to kill him.

When Jacob asks why no one knows that magic is real, Flynn explains that magic once traveled along the planet's ley lines. Over the centuries, it's been drained and stored in artifacts like Excalibur. As magic fades, The Librarians make sure any lingering power stays out of the wrong hands.

Eve tells Flynn about Lamia's snake tattoo, and Flynn immediately realizes that the Serpent Brotherhood, an ancient cult set on bringing magic back into the world, are the ones killing off potential Librarians. As Flynn and Eve try to figure out what Professor Sheir discovered that could have started them on their murder spree, Jacob recognizes the painting that Sheir had been bringing to his meeting with Flynn as the ""Crown of King Arthur"". Things start to click into place for Flynn, who knows that the real Crown of King Arthur was forged by Merlin to help Arthur control the magic he used to build Camelot. Flynn surmises that the Brotherhood want magic back in the world but need the crown to control it, as uncontrolled magic leads to chaos. He decides that he needs to start by examining the painting; Ezekiel tells him it's in the Munich Museum of History and Art, which he'd cased for a heist recently. Eve realizes that the others were targeted because they were already doing what Librarians do: investigating, exploring, and learning, making them the most likely people to find the crown, and therefore a threat to the Brotherhood. Flynn once again tries to leave on his own, but the others tell him that they're going as well, whether he likes it or not.

They arrive at the museum in Munich, but find that the Serpent Brotherhood are also there, looking for the painting. While Eve fights off The Brotherhood, the rest use their unique talents to investigate the painting. Jacob recognizes that the red in the painting is carmine, which wasn't discovered until the 1500s, meaning that the painting is a fake; Ezekiel notices that the painting's frame is attached to the wall, so it can't be moved. Cassandra finds a binary code embedded its frame. Flynn puts everything together, realizing that the code gives coordinates, with the unmovable painting as the key. They follow the coordinates to a sundial outside the museum, which bears a Latin inscription giving the location of ""the crown of the Celts"", deep in the Black Forest.

In the forest, the team finds a henge: a sign of Celtic influence. Unfortunately, the Brotherhood have also found their way to the forest. Eve heads off to stall them, taking Ezekiel with her at Flynn's suggestion, and reveals that she's read his FBI files--both of them. Meanwhile, Flynn, Jacob, and Cassandra get to work on the puzzle of the henge, which is astrological in nature. Although they're not there on the right day, Cassandra can do the math to recreate the sun's path, leading them through the clues on the henge until she gets overwhelmed. While Jacob gets her grounded again, Flynn finds the cache hiding the crown of King Arthur. Flynn jury-rigs a welding torch from an oxygen tank and some prosciutto stuffed into a cucumber and leaves Jake and Cassandra to it so he can help out Eve and Ezekiel. While he engages Lamia and her samurai sword in a duel with a crowbar, Ezekiel sabotages the Brotherhood's helicopter, which explodes as he, Flynn, and Eve make a run for it.

When they arrive back at the clearing with the henge, Jacob has just finished cutting open the cache, revealing the crown.

Once back at The Library, with the crown safely put in a display case, everyone agrees the newcomers did well for their first time out. As they discuss heading out--Jacob has to get back to work, while Ezekiel has things to steal--Cassandra asks how Flynn became the Librarian. When he tells her that the previous Librarian had died, she points out that the three of them are the only candidates left, meaning that if Flynn dies, it will likely be one of them taking over. Flynn laughs, but at that moment, alarms start blaring. Someone has set off the Library's perimeter alarm.

Checking on the Library through a mirror, Flynn says that no one can get into the Library unless someone lets them in--but as he says that, the Brotherhood breech The Library, meaning someone has disabled the magical security from the inside. With Cal by his side, Flynn races to the Library, followed by the others. Jacob and Ezekiel accuse each other of being the one to let the Brotherhood in, but are interrupted by Brotherhood ninjas trying to kill both of them, meaning that neither of them was behind the betrayal. Meanwhile, Flynn finds Lamia, apparently holding Cassandra hostage. As he tries to negotiate, he realizes that Cassandra is holding the crown: she's the one who let the Brotherhood into the Library, having been promised that magic could save her life. Flynn points out that serpents lie, and begins to fight Lamia, who puts on the crown.

Fresh from an unseen fight, a furious Charlene storms into Flynn's office to tell Judson that the Brotherhood has invaded the Library, then tells him to ""do it"". He points out that the Library has gotten very big, and it will take both of them. She tells him that she knows, and touches the mirror, power building around them as she laments that Flynn will never save his receipts. Together, Charlene and Judson's spirit begin to seal the library.

With the crown on her head, Lamia controls Excalibur. She turns the sword on Flynn, striking him deep. She tells the Brotherhood minions to let Dulaque know that they have ""the key"" to open the lock and return magic the world. But first, they must kill the Librarian--Flynn, who is lying on the floor, bleeding heavily from the wound left by Excalibur, the sword whose wounds never heal."

The group learns of Cassandra's betrayal and Flynn drinks from a hidden bottle, a slug from the Bathsheba's Oil of Healing slows the bleeding of his wound long enough for them to go chasing after Charlene.

Lamia has her henchmen stealing from The Library and everyone is forced to flee when the bell gong counts down, as the Library begins to fold in on itself thanks to Charlene's magic. The bad guys take the elevator while our heroes escape through a door that spits them out in a forest in Oregon. Flynn's still bleeding and they need to get him some help. They're met by Jenkins who is waiting for them on the side of the road. He drives them to a secret annex of the Library, which is hidden in the base of a suspension bridge. From here, they're able to access all of the information contained in the library but not the artifacts. Also, Flynn's magical wound still isn't healing. Eve anticipates that Flynn's wound will kill him in 24 hours and tells the potential Librarians about how there's only one Librarian at a time, with a new one being chosen when the current one dies.

Lamia brings Cassandra to Dulaque, our mystery-murderer from the premiere who monologues about Librarians being terrible for keeping magic from the world. Cassandra asks if they can really cure her, and he says they can, even giving Lamia the evil-eye to stop her from killing Cassandra, believing her to be of use.

Eve gives Flynn a pep-talk about using his brain and he is inspired to remember that Lamia called Excalibur a key. Keys unlock things so what's the lock? The stone that Arthur pulled Excalibur from, of course! So it's off to London where the stone is sat on a massive ley line. With only 12 hours or so to live, Flynn and the rest of the group must hurry and steal the emerald Stone of Marrakesh from the Tower of London in order to locate the Stone of King Arthur. Ezekiel puts a plan together and it is successful. Flynn transforms the emerald into a lodestone, which they all must follow.

The Brotherhood is working underground in secret chambers they dug. They're trying to reach the chamber under Buckingham Palace in which the royal family has guarded a magical stone for centuries. Our heroes reach the palace outside and decide they will infiltrate through some forged invitations to a charity ball.

Dulaque is also at the ball where the heroes are hard at work to find the chamber, while Lamia, Cassandra, and the henchmen are at the chamber, where Cassandra must decipher a puzzle so the protective barrier can be reached. After doing so, Cassandra is taken away while Lamia puts Excalibur back into the stone and a blue light is released. The lights begin to flicker and Dulaque's eyes flash blue.

Our heroes go through a hidden passageway behind a wine cellar. They find Cassandra locked up and release her, as she's offering to help and apparently they're not one for holding grudges. She's able to offer up just the right information so they can electromagnetize Flynn's pipe, which Flynn uses to zap the crown off Lamia's head after fighting her in a duel. He also calls Excalibur from the stone to defeat Lamia and then Excalibur begins to die. Flynn's last move is to give Cassandra Excalibur so the last remainders of its magic can cure her tumour. An emotional Cassandra instead opts to lay the sword on Flynn's sword and zap! Flynn's wound is healed and he comes back to life. She tells Flynn he has already saved her. Flynn then lays Excalibur on the stone, which it is reabsorbed back into.

Flynn send the potentials packing, saying it's not safe for them. Jenkins notes the tragedy of the loss of the Library itself. Judson tells Flynn that the Library and Charlene are fine and intact. Flynn determines that he can find a way to re-tether the Library to their reality if the potentials to the day-to-day work that he would normally be doing. He tells the potentials to check their plane tickets and when they open their envelopes, they find that the Library has already turned the tickets into invitations. The Annex is their base of operations for now and Jenkins will supervise the training of the potentials.

Eve walks Flynn out and promises to protect the potentials, with Flynn admitting he trusts her to do so. He believes that the Library chose her to be their guardian. He admits that he'd love to be travelling the world with her but they agree that the job comes first, though they share a kiss before going their separate ways. Jenkins suggests that the group use the Clippings Book to pick cases, since it documents new bizarre mysteries happening every day."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3905292/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,The Librarians' first solo mission hits a snag when Baird loses the others in a mysterious Labyrinth that magically exists below the skyscraper of a modern corporation.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Marc Roskin'],"['', '', '']",[],"['minotaur', 'labyrinth', 'ball of twine', 'minoan', 'artifact', 'lost in a maze', 'maze', 'villainess']",[],"In a non-descript set of hallways, a young man is being chased by an unseen threat. He finds two cloaked people and begs for help, but they start chanting in Ancient Greek and ignore his pleas. As he's dragged away, they finish chanting, and head into an elevator, where they remove the cloaks and reveal themselves to be office workers, chatting about where to order lunch.

Ezekiel, Cassandra, and Jake are being chased inside a warehouse, but the person chasing them is revealed to be Eve. She's training them and chides them on their lack of readiness for potential fights on assignments. Jake needs to be smarter with his moves instead of simply relying on brute force, while Ezekiel bailed on his team members, and Cassandra simply stayed hidden out of fear. Eve intends to drill them again tomorrow. New pages are still appearing in The Library's Clippings book, so there's already assignments out there waiting, but Eve has refused to let them out ever since Flynn left. Jenkins warns Eve that being in harm's way is part of the job and she'll have to let them out eventually.

While they debate the issue, the Librarians peek at the book and find that Henry Birch, the young man from the opening and a chemical engineer and Fulbright scholar in Boston, has recently gone missing and his disappearance is connected to seven other disappearances. Though the victims were from all over, they all disappeared in Boston and were all interns at the Golden Axe Food Company. Eve reluctantly agrees to let the new Librarians go on this mission, acknowledging that people are likely at risk.

Jenkins shows them what he's been working on: a ""back door"" that can be used as a wormhole to open as a door anywhere. He warns them that he is still working out the kinks, but it's certainly faster than a plane. The team steps through the door and ends up in Boston, a short walk away from Golden Axe's headquarters.

The team begins by questioning Karen Willis, the CEO of the company, who claims to have no idea that eight of her interns have gone missing. She's also confused as to why NATO is interested in what's happening. After a brief interruption by an intern, Jennie, she sends them to look through the records at HR.

Eve is certain that Ms. Willis knows more than she's admitting, so Eve says she'll check the server room and sends the Librarians to HR, which is in the building's basement. When Eve reaches the ""server room,"" she instead finds the room is full of Minoan artifacts. As for the Librarians, they find that ""HR"" is actually a room filled with human skulls. While Eve calls the team to tell them what she has found, the Librarians figure out that everything is tied to the Greek myth of the Minotaur, and then realize that they're trapped in the Labyrinth--the hallways no longer have an exit.

Eve calls Jenkins to let him know what has happened, and says that he needs to figure out how to get the Back Door to open in the Labyrinth to get them out. Eve then heads down into the Labyrinth after the Librarians. They're eventually able to find their way to one another, but they're near by the Minotaur. Fortunately, Jenkins is able to activate the Back Door and get them out in time.

Ms. Willis and her second-in-command, Mr. Franklin, meet in the artifacts room to discuss the team. They wonder if they could be related to the Library, but say that there's only one Librarian and he's currently in Budapest. She says they need to move up the timeline, starting with Jennie, the intern who'd interrupted the meeting earlier.

Back in the Annex, Jenkins explains the rules of magic to the team: every spell needs a source of power and a focus for that power in order to have an effect on reality. He believes that the thread that Eve saw in the artifacts room is in fact the original thread that Theseus used to navigate the original Labyrinth, and is likely the power source keeping the current Labyrinth running. The team continues to do research and determine that Golden Axe Foods is drawing magic from the Minotaur by sacrificing interns, like King Minos in the original myth, in order to have good harvests and high stock prices. Cassandra is let down that they won't be able to save Henry and Eve advises her that they will find justice for him.

When the team heads back to Boston to try to remove the thread and collapse the Labyrinth, they discover that the Labyrinth has expanded to include the city around them, and realize it's a curse rather than a location. The Minotaur makes an appearance, disguised as a larger biker, and they barely escape.

When they regroup, Eve tries to give the team orders, but Cassandra points out that they aren't soldiers. Eve realizes that she's right, and when Ezekiel points out that they need to get to the centre of the maze to pull the plug on it, the team determines a course of action. They come to the conclusion that they need to split up: Eve and Jake will fight the Minotaur to distract it, while Cassandra and Ezekiel will go back into the Labyrinth to find the thread.

Cassandra does calculations to get them to the centre of the maze, but finds that she's overwhelmed by the seven-dimension space that it occupies. When she worries that she's not cut out for this, and that she's just going to let everyone down again, Ezekiel tells her that while she betrayed them, she came back for them and didn't let them down. He says that in her situation, he would have done the same thing, but worse: he would have let Flynn die to save himself. He offers to guide her through the Labyrinth so she can close her eyes and navigate the maze without visual distractions.

When Eve tries to take on the Minotaur herself, Stone grabs a nearby truck and slams into the Minotaur with it--working smarter and harder. The two of them make an escape from the Minotaur, fleeing to the Annex, but the Minotaur chases them down and starts breaking down the door.

Back in the Labyrinth, Cassandra and Ezekiel reach the artifact room, but are interrupted by Ms. Willis, who holds them at gunpoint. She considers sacrificing them, but Cassandra surprises everyone by trying to tackle her, discharging the gun and shattering the case around the thread. Ezekiel grabs the thread and appears to make a break for it, back into the Labyrinth, but reappears once Ms. Willis leaves to chase after him. Unfortunately, she isn't tricked for long, but when Cassandra realizes that the ball of thread is representational magic and Ezekiel throws it into the Labyrinth, unraveling it, Ms. Willis makes a break for it.

The thread shoots out of the Back Door in the Annex, and Stone catches it. It takes the combined strength of him, Eve, and Jenkins to pull the other two out of the Labyrinth. With the ball of thread now the Annex's first artifact, the Labyrinth's power starts to fade, and the Minotaur is released--bad news for Ms. Willis and Mr. Franklin, who are now the targets of a Minotaur with a grudge.

Cassandra expresses her concerns to Jake about the fact that he doesn't trust her, and he tells her that no one back home knows his about the academic part of his life, and that discovering the Library was the first time he'd opened up about it. She'd betrayed that trust, and while he likes her, he doesn't trust her, and he's decided that he was right not to trust anyone in the first place.

Gathering the team together, Eve tells them that they did a good job, and that she was the one who needed to learn how to work with a team that isn't military in nature, neither soldiers to command nor assets to protect. Stone suggests that she think of them as partners instead, and she decides that works for her."

Rather than the traditional fat, bearded Christmas icon, he's a middle-aged man wearing a fancy suit and a nice hat. A man comes with a shotgun, trying to steal donations from a volunteer Santa who's dropped into the kitchen, but the real Santa talks him down, looking into his heart to find the good in him. However, Santa is then shot with a mistletoe tranquilizer and realises the robbery was a trick to make him reveal himself.

At the Annex, the team prepares for Christmas, with varying levels of excitement. Cassandra loves Christmas and is enthusiastically decorating, while Jacob wraps presents for his family members. Eve is in a bad mood, as Flynn's desk keeps resetting itself, and she's not into Christmas cheer. The others defend Christmas: Cassandra adores it, even though her parents revealed that Santa wasn't real to her at the age of three and she wishes she could have believed a little longer. Jacob likes seeing his nieces and nephews and misses spending Christmas Eve with his cousins, which often involved a bar brawl. Ezekiel loves Christmas and how clearly marked expensive goods are at that time of year, although when pushed, he admits that he sometimes wonders what it would be like to be a good guy.

Suddenly, Jenkins interrupts the annex-decorating festivities to say that Christmas is cancelled: Santa has been kidnapped. As the team reacts to the news that Santa is real, Jenkins explains that Santa isn't actually the figure they've been led to believe, but an immortal avatar of good cheer. Santa collects good will throughout the year and returns it on Christmas. But if he fails to do so, there will be worldwide chaos. That's why folks are cranky during the holidays: they're running low on good will.

Jacob and Cassandra go to the soup kitchen and learn that the kidnappers had snake tattoos, and realize that Santa has been kidnapped by the Serpent Brotherhood. As they try to track down the kidnappers, Cassandra recognizes Dulaque in surveillance footage and points him out to the others, who had only met Lamia when the Brotherhood had made their attempt to bring magic back into the world. Jenkins seems intensely shocked to hear that name, and obviously recognizes Dulaque. Jenkins determines that they are planning to kill Santa on Christmas Eve at midnight in order to absorb his stored magical power.

At the Serpent Brotherhood's base in London, Santa is being held hostage, but doesn't seem overly concerned about it. He speaks to Lamia, telling her that he's disappointed in her, as he knows she wants to help people, but she's going about it the wrong way. However, he's once again tranquilized by Dulaque before he can finish the conversation.

As Cassandra was taken to the Brotherhood's base while she was working with them, they realize that they can use her memory to help them figure out its location, even though she was blindfolded at the time. While Ezekiel hacks into London's many surveillance cameras, Eve walks Cassandra through using her other senses to recall what else she experienced when she was taken by the Brotherhood. The clues she offers up help Ezekiel determine the right street, while Jacob uses his architectural knowledge to find the exact house.

Jacob and Eve make their way inside the Serpent Brotherhood's lair, where Jacob is distracted first by the amazing art collection, then by Lamia flirting with him. Dulaque orders his underlings to kill them, but Jacob and Eve interrupt them by throwing the many rare and expensive items on display in the room towards the members of the Brotherhood, forcing them to focus on catching the art.

Meanwhile, Ezekiel and Cassandra slide down a chimney into the room where Santa's being held. Cassandra is elated to learn that Santa knows her name, while Ezekiel seems concerned when Santa informs him that he's been a bit naughty.

Dulaque and Lamia realise that Jake and Eve are stalling, so they run off to get to Santa, leaving Jacob to catch the last falling statue himself. When they get to the room, they find that Santa's gone. Dulaque says they won't get far, as Santa ""won't be feeling quite himself"".

Cassandra and Ezekiel get Santa to Eve and Jake. When Jacob introduces himself, Santa says that he knows him, ""both incarnations"" of him, which causes Jacob to look unsettled. He says he needs to get to his sleigh to get to the North Pole. Eve reluctantly agrees to help him find his sleigh, even though she's already annoyed by the fact that Santa speaks in the third person. She puts Santa's hat on Ezekiel so he can serve as a distraction, along with Cassandra and Jacob, while she takes Santa to the rail yard where he left his sleigh. Unfortunately, when they get there, they find out that Santa's sleigh has been stolen.

Ezekiel seems thrilled to spread good will while wearing the hat, and even showers a homeless man with money.

As Eve tries to find the sleigh, Santa shifts and goes invisible, reappearing as a Serpent Brotherhood thug attempts to attack Eve. He uses a staff that he's suddenly holding to take down the attacker, and also magically puts a small toy into Eve's shoe.

Eve finds and old, red truck, and starts driving them away from the rail yard. She calls Jenkins, who realizes that Santa has changed incarnations and is now Nikolas the Wondermaker, a much more trickster-like character who left gifts in children's shoes. Something's off about Santa, and he can't seem to keep his incarnations straight. As it turns out, his hat is a talisman: an anchor that helps him maintain his current incarnation, which would explain why Ezekiel's so set on spreading Christmas cheer. Without it, he's more susceptible to the poison administered by Dulaque through the darts. Jenkins advises Eve that they need to keep moving, otherwise Santa can be tracked because of all his magic.

Eve isn't happy about being stuck on a road trip with Santa, and decides that she'll call him ""Nick"", as she can't bring herself to call him Santa. He tries to talk to her about her dislike of Christmas, but she cuts him off, saying that the real Santa would understand why she doesn't like it. Jenkins asks if they've made any progress in getting to the North Pole, and Eve points out that there's no way she can drive them there. Santa uses his magic to super-speed the truck, but it runs out of gas in Canada, stranding them.

The other three return to the Annex, where Ezekiel continues to spread Christmas cheer, donning a festive apron to make hot chocolate and cookies, and stuffing stockings. Cassandra determines that the North Pole is special because of the ley lines, and calculates a place where Santa can spread Christmas cheer using the northern lights.

They tell this news to Eve, and send Cassandra and Ezekiel to get a plane ready at an airport in the area, while Stone heads into a small town nearby to meet up with Eve and Santa and find them a car. Eve and Santa start walking, and Santa offers up some insight on how Eve never felt like she belonged on Christmas because she's always been moving, spending her Christmases on different army bases as a child and in different war zones as an adult. When he tries to tell her that being with other people means she belongs, that the entire human race belongs together, she points out that she was in most of those places on Christmas because the people there were fighting each other, even on Christmas. Santa says that while people's actions can't be undone, their hearts can be changed, but Eve doesn't believe him.

They get into town and meet up with Jake in a bar, the Zanadew Lounge, where Santa reverts to his ""Odin"" reincarnation, drinking heavily and starting an enthusiastic bar fight with the locals, much to Jacob's delight. Unfortunately, when they finally get to the airport, they find that the pilot is gone because Ezekiel, in a fit of Christmas joy, sent him home to be with his fiancée. However, Santa claims that he can fly large objects through the air, so he pilots the plane towards the part of Alaska where the northern lights can be reached.

Unfortunately, Santa is starting to feel ill from the weight of the good will and the effects of the poison, and struggles to keep them on track. As they approach the Aurora Borealis, Dulaque and Lamia board the plane while it's still in flight using Santa's sleigh, which they stole. Dulaque makes a mock-attempt to get the Librarians to hand over Santa, ending with him simply saying that he's going to kill them. Santa passes out and Eve puts the plane on auto-pilot. She brings Santa back to the cargo area and finds that Lamia and Dulaque have subdued the other three. Dulaque informs her that he's poisoned Santa with holly and mistletoe, ""old hedge magics"", and says that Morgan Le Fay would be proud. He gets Lamia to disable the plane and prepares to kidnap Santa once more.

Eve tricks Dulaque into putting Santa's hat on, by letting him know that it's a magical talisman of power. The Librarians use the fact that the hat makes the wearer want to spread joy to others, telling Dulaque it would make them very happy if Lamia left, and he sends her away in the sleigh. However, Dulaque removes the hat when they try to get him to say how to stop the Brotherhood. Eve manages to kick him towards the cargo door, and grabs his hand, but Dulaque willingly lets himself out of Eve's grasp to fall out of the plane. The plane is struggling to stay up, but Eve manages to land it with some help from Jacob looking it up on Google.

They make their way to an abandoned but still working pipeline survey station, but find out that Santa's not up to the task of delivering the gift, due to his being poisoned. Although each of the Librarians offers to help, even knowing they might not survive the experience, Santa reveals to the group that Eve is tuned into Christmas because she was born on Christmas Eve--which is why she's named ""Eve"". Santa transfers all of humanity's good will to Eve and tasks her with delivering the ""gift"": all of humanity's good will, transformed into hope. She is transported magically throughout the world and helps countless people to save lives, be encouraged, and feel hope. When she comes to, she finds she has survived and all good will has been spread.

Jenkins lets Eve know that Dulaque will have survived falling out of the plane, as they're--himself and Dulaque--are much tougher than that. However, he also lets her know that Santa is making a full recovery.

Just as Eve says that her plans for the holiday are a little peace and quiet, Cassandra, Jacob, and Ezekiel surprise her with a birthday party, with a banner, cake, and presents. As they celebrate, they realize that each of them got what they'd wished for earlier: Cassandra gets to believe in Santa, while Jacob got his bar brawl, and Ezekiel got to be a good guy for a while, although he claims he hated it. When Cassandra says that it's too bad Eve didn't make a Christmas wish that would have come true, Eve just smiles."

The dragons live beneath the earth and when angered, they awaken. Dragons can cause all kinds of trouble, including strange weather and natural disasters such as earthquakes. Eastern dragons (the Fei Lung) and Western dragons have had a blood feud stretching back many millennia and a fight between them could lead to widespread destruction. Eve has mixed feelings about Flynn's return, as she feels he is disrupting the team and undermining her authority as team leader.

The team meets a representative from the Eastern dragons, a lawyer named Mr. Drake, who informs them that the Western Dragons have stolen the Mystic Pearl of the Fei Lung. He demands that it be returned or else the dragons will go to war. Due to a misunderstanding, it is up to Ezekiel to deal with Mr. Drake, who has brought with him a long list of grievances the Eastern dragons wish to see addressed in an Intercession. Jenkins takes on the task of assisting Ezekiel with the details of the Intercession, but the two are often at odds - Jenkins feels that Ezekiel is not taking things seriously and cannot be trusted with a task of this importance.

Meanwhile, Flynn, Eve, Jacob, and Cassandra head to Vatican City in search of the lair of the Western Dragons, which lies underneath the city. After a quick escape from the Vatican, the team makes their way through puzzles and traps to retrieve the Mystic Pearl. However, the Pearl secretly holds the Apple of Discord, which brings out the worst possible version of whomever holds it. The Apple first infects Jake, who tries to rearrange a local art gallery by force. Flynn, Eve, and Cassandra encounter one of the Western Dragons, who tells them that they were not the ones behind the theft of the Pearl. The team manages to disarm Jacob, but the Apple is transferred to Cassandra. Using math, she is able to easily take down Lamia, and then sets her sights on causing a massive power grid failure. While the team manages to disarm her, Eve and Flynn end up with the Apple -- first sharing it, then fighting over it when it becomes clear that their evil visions for the future are incompatible. Lamia nearly gets killed when she interferes in the fight, and in the end, Flynn escapes with the Apple.

Back in the Annex, Ezekiel finds himself having to chair a Conclave of several magical factions (including the Jinn, the Fae Legions, and the Iron Kingdom) in which they must try to resolve their disputes peacefully. Unfortunately for them, things take a turn for the worse when Dulaque shows up, trying to remove the Library from its historical role as arbiter among them. Ezekiel is upset when Dulaque's appearance causes Jenkins to leave, but Jenkins eventually comes back to help try to keep things under control. Dulaque's play for power is in full swing when the session is interrupted by a power-crazed, Apple-holding Flynn. Happily, the team is able to get Ezekiel close enough to pickpocket the Apple away and Flynn convinces the conclave attendees (except Dulaque) of the necessity of the Library.

The team is deeply concerned about what will happen to Ezekiel when he holds the Apple, but it turns out that he is immune -- he is already the worst version of himself. Ezekiel also realizes that Mr. Drake was the one to originally steal the Pearl, and prevents him from causing any more trouble.

Finally, Jenkins has a private moment with Dulaque and tells him off, knowing that he was the one to wake the dragons and cause all of the trouble that the team just had to face, all for his own agenda. Dulaque tries to offer Jenkins the opportunity to join his side, but Jenkins says that what they once had is gone now.

Flynn is impressed with the work Eve has done, so he offers her transfer papers to go from NATO to Guardian permanently and says he'll stay if she does. Eve signs the papers, but reminds him that he must go back out and recover the main Library."

An angry truck driver decides to speed through it. Barely avoiding another car, he gets to the other side of the bridge. Suddenly a huge hand grabs his car, and he gets thrown of the bridge.

The clippings book informs the Librarians of strange happenings in the town of Bremen, including the truck accident. Eve, Jacob, Cassandra, and Ezekiel go to Bremen to investigate, although Ezekiel is skeptical. They wonder how they'll convince the locals to help them, and discuss the fact that on TV, the explanation for weird things always seems to be ""swamp gas"". The team introduces themselves to Sheriff Heyer, claiming that they are from the Metropolitan Library and are there to do a traffic flow study. The Sheriff buys this explanation and tells them about the accident. After Ezekiel insults the town and annoys the Sheriff, Baird gets frustrated with him and tells him not to taunt local law enforcement.

They arrive at the wreck of the truck, and Cassandra recognizes a pattern on the window, but can't make out what it is. When Stone sprays it with a fire extinguisher, the pattern becomes clear and they realize it is a giant fingerprint. Speaking to them via iPad from the Annex, Jenkins explains it might be a troll, and warns them that trolls are dangerous, but are subdued in daylight. He asks them to obtain a picture or a sample of the troll in order to identify the species.

Baird sends Stone and Cassandra to find out if there was any surveillance footage of the crash, and brings a reluctant Ezekiel with her to investigate the area around the bridge. While they search for any signs of a troll, Baird tells Ezekiel that he needs to take the job seriously if he wants to be a Librarian. He replies that he's in the job for fun, and that if he gets bored, he's out. Their conversation is interrupted by the discovery of the troll, which is frozen in stone during daylight. Eve sends Ezekiel to retrieve some samples.

Meanwhile, Cassandra thanks Stone for being willing to work with her after her betrayal of the team. Stone says he is fine working with her, but he does not trust her. Cassandra asks if there is a chance for her to earn that trust. Stone says he is fine with how it is. The two meet the Sheriff, but their discussion is interrupted by the naked Mayor, out for a jog. The Mayor believes he is wearing his new jogging outfit, a birthday present from his wife. The Mayor runs off and Stone and Cassandra asks the Sheriff if there have been any other unusual events recently. The Sheriff mentions a number of odd things that have happened, including a girl going missing, talking animals in a local barn, and a woman getting stuck in her pizza oven.

The team meets up again, and Eve and Ezekiel tell the other two about the troll. Cassandra and Jacob start to explain that there is more going on, but before they can go into detail, they see a huge wolf running through the streets. The wolf starts to attack a woman, and when the Sheriff and his man freeze, Jacob grabs an axe off of a fire truck and throws it at the wolf, killing it. Ezekiel asks him where he learned that and Jacob says he does not know. They notice that the wolf is wearing a frilly nightcap, and realize that the strange events in town are being caused by fairy tales coming to life.

With Jenkins' help, they narrow down the list of artifacts that could cause the situation to two: the Mother Goose Treaty of 1918, and Aesop's lyre. Jenkins asks them to retrieve the dead wolf in order to do an autospy on it, and the team returns to Bremen, where they find out that the wolf is being stored in the back freezer of Walter's Tavern. While Ezekiel and Jacob try to sneak the wolf out of the tavern, Eve and Cassandra distract Walter, and discuss the strain between Cassandra and Jacob. The girls at the bar seem to be particularly interested in Cassandra, and Cassandra notices that Eve's hair is down. The boys manage to get the wolf out of the tavern, and find a truck that the owner has left unlocked, with the key in it. How very lucky for Ezekiel.

Ezekiel and Jacob bring the wolf to the Annex, where Jenkins helps them with the autopsy. They realize the night cap is part of the wolf. When Jacob cuts the wolf open there is a young woman, Liza, in it, still alive. She was the girl who had gone missing on her way to the music festival. Jenkins realizes that the artifact causing the changes is actually the Libris Fabula, which had previously been crossed off the list as it was believed to have been lost. The Libris Fabula is a story book that can bring any story to life, but at a cost. It is revealed the stories are being read by a man to a sick girl.

The team brings Liza to the hospital, where Eve and Ezekiel pretend they found her in the woods, and claim her story is due to trauma from exposure. Liza doesn't remember anything, and completely ignores Jacob in favour of Cassandra, even asking for her number. Meanwhile, the Sheriff mentions the wolf got stolen after Ezekiel was at the bar. Ezekiel taunts him and says he is overworked, causing the Sheriff, who seems to be changing, to say that Ezekiel is trouble.

Jenkins meets them in the hospital waiting area and explains the Libris Fabula to them: it starts by bringing the stories already within it to life, but as it gets more powerful, new stories can be added or old ones can be rewritten by the person reading the book, and they can overtake entire nations. It feeds off the people affected by the stories--in the past, it caused the Black Death. Jenkins suggests they look for people who have gotten mysteriously ill or died. While Jenkins and Cassandra go to investigate the hospital records, Eve and Jacob head to the Bremen Library to see if they can track down any leads on the book itself. As they're leaving, Ezekiel manages to trigger the coin return in a vending machine to dump out coins like a slot machine, and an exasperated Eve tells him to stay out of jail.

During their investigation, Jenkins and Cassandra find a number of unusual occurences, but no unusual illnesses or deaths. As all of the fairy tale-inspired cases have happened within the past few weeks, Cassandra suggests that the Libris Fabula must have only just started building its power. When she mentions that it's good that the stories are only fairy tales, Jenkins explains that the stories in the Libris Fabula are the original, darker versions of the stories, ""full of death and dismemberment"", and that the major roles that had not yet been filled are often the ones with the most horrible fates.

Eve and Jacob go to the Bremen Library and ask the librarian, Mr. McGuire, about some very old books they notice. He tells them that he is cataloguing Thompson Deter's collection of books. Jacob recognizes the name as being a rare book collector, and Mr. McGuire informs them that Mr. Deter had died a few weeks back, leaving his collection to Mr. McGuire to catalogue. They offer to help him with the cataloguing, as they are librarians themselves, but he declines and locks the books away. Eve and Jacob realize they'll need Ezekiel to break into the library and search for the Libris Fabula.

Back at the hospital Ezekiel follows a moving coin into a hospital room and meets the sick girl who was being read to earlier, Jamie. She is dying. Ezekiel teaches her how to pick locks so she can get herself pudding and not have to eat green jello, and she reveals that no one knows why she's sick, but that she'd fallen asleep during story hour at the local library. When she mentions that she loves fairy tales, Ezekiel starts looking for the book, but she tells him that they aren't kept there, and that she's only allowed visitors on reading days. Ezekiel says that he'll be back, and leaves the coin with her for luck.

The team gets together at the bar, where the local women are trying to flirt with Cassandra. Eve and Jacob tell the others about the books at the library, and Cassandra says that they need to get the book before it can do any real damage, but Ezekiel says that they need to go to the hospital first as he thinks Jamie is involved. Before they come to a decision, Sheriff Heyer arrives and handcuffs Ezekiel, informing the others that Jamie is his daughter and Ezekiel had broken into her hospital room and taught her how to pick locks. While Eve tries to reason with the Sheriff, Ezekiel frees himself from the handcuffs. Infuriated, the Sheriff transforms into a big, bad wolf-man and huffs and puffs and blows the windows out of the bar.

The team escapes the tavern through a side door and flee the transformed Sheriff and the local football team, the Wolves, who are also transforming. While they're hiding, the team realizes they're becoming the archetypes previously mentioned by Jenkins: Eve is turning into a Princess, with long hair and a tendency to sing unexpectedly; Jacob is becoming the Huntsman, with an axe appearing in his hand and an owl settling on his arm; and Cassandra is becoming Prince Charming, attracting attention from the local women. They call Jenkins, who confirms their suspicions and reminds them that not only are they not guaranteed happy endings, but that bystanders could get hurt. He says that the only one who tends to escape stories unscathed is the Jack, the lucky thief who lives by his wits. At this point, they realize that Ezekiel has vanished. As Eve, Jacob, and Cassandra walk through town, they see that more and more townspeople are becoming fairy tale characters--meaning the book is getting stronger. When their plan to get everyone out of town is foiled by a giant wall of thorny vines springing up around the town, they decide to head back to the library, but take the civilians with them. Cassandra, as Prince Charming, leads the way, but the wolves start tracking them to the library.

Ezekiel goes back to Jamie's room, where he finds Mr. McGuire reading her the story, and discovers that Jamie won't wake up. When Ezekiel says the book is killing her and that Mr. McGuire has to stop, the librarian says that he knows exactly what he's doing. Ezekiel tries to grab the book, however, the old man grabs his wrist and throws him away with superhuman power. Mr. McGuire explains that while the book drains the person being read to, the person reading it gets stronger. His plan for his own ""happily ever after"" is to drain the town and regain his youth, and he starts the story again, setting the wolves after the other Librarians.

In the library, Jacob, Cassandra and Eve, now nearly fully transformed into the archetypes, hide the citizens and prepare to defend them against the wolves. Eve calls Ezekiel, who tells her about Mr. McGuire, Jamie, and the book, and she tells him he's the Jack, with the power of luck, and that he needs to stop Mr. McGuire from reading the story. The wolves break in and Cassandra stands on the table and gives a rousing speech as they prepare to fight them. Eve starts to look more like a princess and is charmed by Cassandra, but Jacob gets her to snap out of it. Jacob engages the wolves with his axe and fights the Sheriff in single combat. Cassandra uses a table leg to fight the wolves. Eve struggles with her fight, thrown off by the sudden appearance of high heels. She tells Ezekiel to change the story.

Ezekiel grabs the book and says the wolves are now blind, which instantly happens. Mr. McGuire throws him away again and says that isn't a story, and that the wolves are going to kill his friends. The wolves quickly overpower the team and Jacob starts losing his fight against the transformed Sheriff Heyer. Just as it seems that the wolves have won, Ezekiel grabs the coin he'd left with Jamie and throws it. It takes a number of very lucky bounces and hits Mr. McGuire, magically freezing him in place. When Ezekiel takes the book from him and gives it to Jamie, she wakes up and Mr. McGuire is sucked into the book. Ezekiel encourages her to change the story and come up with one of her own to save his team.

Jamie uses her imagination to transform the team again: Jacob becomes a robot, while Eve becomes a ninja princess and Cassandra turns into Merlin in disguise. They quickly defeat Sheriff Heyer and the football players, and Jamie says that the head wolf has to pay for his crimes--by eating green jello. Everyone's transformations wear off, and the team finds the Sheriff sitting in an aisle of the library, surrounded by cups of green jello.

As the Librarians prepare to leave town, they explain the entire thing away as ""swamp gas"", assuring Sheriff Heyer that they've taken care of the situation. Ezekiel shows up with Jamie, now fully healthy, and her father is so happy to have her back that he decides not to press Ezekiel for an explanation. The two of them watch the Librarians leave, and after Jamie asks her dad who they were, he realizes that ""they're librarians"" doesn't actually make any sense as an explanation for the events of the day.

The team returns to the Annex, where Jenkins has collected the rest of Thompson Deter's collection as well as the Libris Fabula. The magical book is revealed to be blank except for a drawing of the Mr. McGuire, trapped inside its pages. Jacob says that the more they experience magic, the weirder it seems to get. Cassandra says she didn't mind having all the women buying her drinks. Eve says she likes having her hair back to normal. They ask Ezekiel if he felt different, but he says that he just felt like his usual awesome self. When they push him on that, saying that he saved the day, he points out that everyone tells him that he can't just rely on luck, but when they all got transformed into legendary heroes, he was just turned into himself.

Annoyed, Eve and Jacob leave to blow off some steam with the punching bag. Ezekiel tells Cassandra that it's really them who are lucky, because they get to know him, and leaves as well. Alone in the Annex, Cassandra holds her hand up to reveal a ball of magical light. She smiles and gently blows it away."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3813430/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,"When a group of competitive high-school students start undercutting each other with witchcraft, the Librarians have to intercede before disaster destroys them all.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Marc Roskin'],"['', '', '']",[],"['science fair', 'villainess']",[],"A student named Jonah Gordon is getting ready for school and preparing a presentation for a science fair when his dad asks if he's ready to go. As he replies, his body begins to freeze, and soon he's entirely unable to move.

Eve arrives at the Annex on a day off and is surprised to discover Jenkins, Jacob, and Cassandra all there as well, working on their own projects. It isn't long before Ezekiel appears as well, running through the back door with a package clutched in his arms and sirens and flashing lights in the background. Luckily for him, the clippings book grabs everyone's attention by levitating and glowing. When Eve asks Jenkins if it's ever done that before, he says no, and that it must be a magical threat of epic proportions. However, what appears in the book is a poster for the Chicagoland STEM Fair, sponsored by the McCabe Learning Foundation. Cassandra is extremely excited to hear about the STEM Fair, which she explains is a science fair dedicated to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.

The Librarians travel to the high school hosting the event, with Cassandra still excitedly talking about the cutting edge developments there. Eve is doubtful that any kind of serious threat could be at found at a high school science fair, but changes her mind when they walk into the auditorium and realize that the STEM fair is much bigger than they'd expected. Cassandra explains that they're highly competitive events. On stage, the superintendent introduces the president of the McCabe Learning Foundation, Lucinda McCabe, who explains that the winners of the fair can receive not only full college scholarships, but also internships and research grants.

After her speech, Lucinda McCabe introduces herself to the Librarians, and when she hears that they're Librarians, she believes they must be the judges from the county library. This gives the Librarians a chance to explore the fair, looking for anything magical or unusual that could have set off the clippings book. While Cassandra is enthusiastic about the experiments and studies, the others are more baffled and bored. Eve finally gets excited when a student, Leonard Cole, has a baking soda volcano--something she'd been reminiscing about earlier--and gives him a pep talk when he says he's not even supposed to be there.

Meanwhile, Cassandra tells Ezekiel that she'd been one of the science fair kids when she was younger, and that she'd had a whole wall of trophies. They see a trio of goth kids heckling the science kids, and when Cassandra says that goths and geeks should be friends, Ezekiel counters that high school is like prison, where ""you find a crew to run with and keep all the other crews down"". Ezekiel plays with a Newton's cradle that's set up nearby, but the first ball doesn't drop back down--it points straight out.

At Leonard's display, he starts up his volcano, which suddenly erupts for real, spewing fire and magma into the air.

Lucinda calms down the public by saying that a student had mixed his chemicals wrong, while Eve and Jacob take Leonard aside to ask him what happened. Eve's attempt to play good cop just results in an overwhelmed Leonard revealing that he has a crush on her. Jacob takes over and finds out that Leonard doesn't even like science fairs, but had entered when his dad had pushed him into it. He'd been fifth alternate, but the students ahead of him had ""a bunch of freaky stuff"" happen to them.

The Librarians realize that Leonard isn't behind the magic, but someone else at the fair must be. Unfortunately, that leaves a lot of options--all the contestants and spectators are suspects. Ezekiel leads Cassandra to the Newton's cradle he found earlier and says that it's magic, and they're shocked when Jenkins appears and says that it's unlikely. He points out that he has free will and can leave the Annex at any time he wants, and that he's a scientist of sorts himself. Ezekiel demonstrates the weird behaviour of the Newton's cradle, which leads Jenkins to realize that magic is ""rewriting local reality"". He surmises that the power in play couldn't come from one amateur magic user, and tells them to look for a coven--a group of magic users working together, in a pattern of three.

Cassandra notices the trio of goths from earlier behaving in a suspicious manner. While Eve and Jacob try to track down the goths, Jenkins explains how magic works to Cassandra and Ezekiel: power, focus, and effect. They realize that the goths had been interested in one specific girl, Amy Meyer, a science fair contestant with an overbearing mother. When they head to her booth, however, it's only her mother there. Meanwhile, Eve and Jacob find the goths and Amy--although they're not performing a spell. Instead, one of the goths, Dashell, is trying to woo Amy with poetry set to music provided by his friends. Amy turns him down, saying that her schooling has to take priority, and flees when he asks if she'll at least consider prom.

Back in the fair, Cassandra and Ezekiel try to ask around about Amy, but the first student they ask coughs up an entire swarm of insects. Once again, Lucinda has an explanation for the general public and says that if they cancel the fair, all the students' projects will be forfeited and the students will be disqualified from the scholarship competition. Amy's mother suggests they just give her the prize, as everyone knows she'll win anyway. Instead, the fair is allowed to continue. Lucinda checks in with Ezekiel and Cassandra, and when they mention the unusual events, she says it's like there's a curse on the fair. Cassandra realizes that it's not someone trying to use magic to win, but to make everyone else lose.

When they mention this to Jenkins, he tells them about the ""Rule of Three""--whatever magic you do comes back to you, amplified threefold. Whoever is trying to use malicious magic against the other competitors is going to be hit with a fatal backlash. He gives them a magic detecting device, built from the Newton's cradle, and tells them to find the focus of the spell, likely either an artifact or a spell. Eve says that they need to figure out who's using the focus, and trace it backwards from there, and suggests they gather intel from someone who isn't involved in the fair. Jacob tracks down Dashell, sitting in the science lab at the school, and after quoting Lord Byron at him, has a heart-to-heart with him about how the roles people take on in high school are just costumes people put on. He tells Dashell that he wore his costume too well for too long, and that if Dashell likes Amy, he shouldn't let their costumes stand in the way.

Having gotten a full scoop on the entire high school science fair politics, Jacob tells Eve that the one thing everyone has in common is that they all hate Amy. The team finds Amy and her mother at her booth and learn that Amy has been winning fairs since first grade. Her mother is very aggressive, referring to herself as ""the Wolverine of mothers"", and says that hobbies and a social life are just distractions. Using the magic detector, Ezekiel discovers that it's reacting to Amy's phone and steals it while the others distract Amy and her mother. They realize that there's an app on the phone called ""Advanced Learning Buddy"" that is a wish-fulfillment spell, disguised as a brain-training program, and that it's too powerful for Amy to have created it. Ezekiel realizes that Amy has never opened the app--someone else must be using it.

Cassandra talks to Amy about the app, and learns that Amy's mother is the one who downloaded the app for her. Amy didn't use the app because it felt wrong, but also because she didn't want to be smarter, she wanted to not have her intelligence be the only thing that defined her. Cassandra explains she was like that in the past, but could not live up to the dream her parents had for her. Afterwards, Cassandra talks to Ezekiel and he asks where her trophies went. She explains that her parents destroyed them as they believed the trophies would be a painful reminder of the past.

While searching for the room with the trophies, Lucinda stumbles through the back door and into the Annex, startling Jenkins.

Through Ezekiel's research, the Librarians discover there are 27 active users of the magical app at the fair. Cassandra realizes that it is three times three times three, meaning any backlash will be multiplied exponentially, and with everyone using it against each other, it's creating a magical feedback loop. Eve is called away by Jenkins, and tells the others to make sure that the kids don't destroy the school.

Back in the Annex, Eve finds Lucinda looking through the Annex's bookshelves and attempts to cover for the Library. However, when Lucinda casually uses magic to split the table, Jenkins introduces her for who she really is: Morgan Le Fay, the sister of King Arthur and a powerful magic user. She realizes that Eve is a Guardian, and calls Jenkins ""Galeas"", before finding Amy's phone and taking credit for the app. She warns them that the backlash from the feedback loop is going to start soon. Jenkins tells Eve to shoot Morgan, calling her ""one of the most evil creatures"", before Morgan magically stops him from speaking. Eve attempts to shoot her, but Morgan easily stops the bullets in mid-air. When Morgan slips away through the door, Jenkins tells Eve to get her, no matter the cost.

Eve rejoins the others and starts to tell them about Morgan, when she interrupts them and explains that she isn't actually the one hurting anyone: she simply put the spell into the app and let everyone else use it against each other. When the backlash kicks in, she can use the magic in it to recharge her own powers and stay young. Before the Librarians can do anything, she vanishes, but Eve knows she has to still be in the area if she wants to use the backlash. Eve and Ezekiel start searching for her, while Cassandra and Jacob realize that they need to build a magical Farraday cage to protect everyone. When Jacob says they don't have time to do that, Cassandra says that someone already has--Amy's booth was designed to protect her from magic, because Morgan needed her to stay in the fair to attract hostility. The table at the booth has a pentagram built out of the legs, and Cassandra determines that they can use the legs, amplified by the wish app, to create a magical barrier that will protect everyone. Amy volunteers to help the Librarians, who need an extra person to hold the fifth leg. Her mother objects, but Amy stands up for herself, telling her mother that it's Amy, not her mother, who gets to decide what happens in Amy's life.

As Ezekiel gathers phones with the app on it, Jacob uses his background in surveying to map out the pentagram, and Amy and Cassandra work on dismantling the table, Eve tracks down Morgan and shocks her by punching her in the face. Morgan is stunned, and Eve explains that she used Morgan's own wish-fulfillment spell to give her an even playing field. When Eve tells Morgan to stop the backlash, Morgan says that she can't, as she isn't the one who created it. Eve must choose between stopping Morgan and saving the kids, and she chooses to save everyone.

The team finishes preparing the Farraday cage, but need everyone inside it to protect them. Amy gets on the stage and announces that she's created a Tesla coil, but that everyone who isn't in the centre of the room will be electrocuted, relying on her reputation as the best to get them to listen. With everyone gathered, Eve, Jacob, Ezekiel, Cassandra, and Amy each position themselves to form one point of the pentagram, and get the Farraday cage working as the magical backlash hits the school.

In the middle of the backlash, time stops around Eve, and she finds Morgan recharging her power. Eve attempts to pick up their fight again, but Morgan dismisses her, and laughs when Eve asks if she's going to use magic to rule the world. Morgan reveals that her plan is to hide, saying that the world is doomed, and that Eve has already been woven into the Loom of Fate. She also has a message for Jenkins, which she passes along to Eve in Latin before vanishing and returning Eve to the normal flow of time.

The Chicagoland STEM Fair wraps up with the superintendent taking over, informing everyone that Amy has been disqualified for disregarding the safety of the attendees, and that Lucinda McCabe was taken to the hospital with injuries. He then announces the winner: Leonard Cole, who had built the baking soda volcano. While Leonard very excitedly makes his way to the stage, Amy and Dashell share a moment in the crowd. Afterwards, Ezekiel congratulates Cassandra on the pentagram, calling it the best project of the day, and gives her the Chicagoland STEM Fair trophy--stolen, of course--for first place in the category of ""Mathemagics"".

Back in the Annex, Eve is startled by an angry, dishevelled Jenkins, who berates her for letting Morgan Le Fay get away. When she asks him how he knows Morgan, he says that they've both lived a long time, but Eve doesn't believe him, pointing out that you don't hate strangers that much. She gives Jenkins the message she received from Morgan for him, and he translates it as, ""Do not fear the villain... Fear the hero."" Jenkins tells her that an end is coming, and she needs to learn to win the war, not the battles, or that none of them will survive."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3724040/?ref_=ttep_ep8,,The Librarians encounter the one of the Houses behind the legend of all haunted houses and set out to destroy it.,[],TV-14,Release date,['John Harrison'],"['', '', '']",[],"['villainess', 'haunted house']",[],"In the Nitra Region of Slovakia, a scared, blood-covered girl screams and runs out of a house in the woods. She spots a van driving down the road nearby and runs in front of it to stop it. When Eve Baird and the Librarians get out of the van, the girl tells them that there's something terrible in the house. She introduces herself as Katie Bender and tells Eve and Jacob Stone that she and her friends were hiking and found the house, and that a man inside it has her friends. She insists that she needs to go back; however, Jacob tells her they will not let her go into the house alone. Ezekiel Jones votes that they avoid the haunted house and go back to Prague, but is ignored.

Meanwhile, Cassandra Cillian is trying to track down the broken ley lines that brought them to the area. She figures out that the break is in the same direction as the house that Katie had come from, which Eve is not happy about. Eve calls Jenkins to let him know, and he tells her that the magical build up from the broken ley lines could be interacting with angry spirits in the house to cause a haunting. Cassandra gives the team magical scrolls which can anchor the ley lines and contain the wild magic. Eve tells Cassandra to stay with Katie while she, Ezekiel and Jacob enter the house to anchor the ley lines and investigate. Cassandra isn't happy about this decision and feels that Eve doesn't trust her, but Eve points out that Katie is traumatized and Cassandra has already helped by figuring out the location of the broken ley lines..

Jacob recognizes the house as a 19th century frontier house and wonders what it's doing in Slovakia. Eve, Jacob, and Ezekiel enter the house and start to clear the rooms. Ezekiel places the scrolls to anchor the magic, but after the second scroll, the house starts to shake, and a knife floats in the air before slamming into the wall next to Ezekiel. The group quickly flees the house. Outside, Katie asks Cassandra who they are, and Cassandra tells her that they're the Librarians.

After Jacob and Ezekiel active the two remaining anchor scrolls, Eve says she, Jacob, and Ezekiel will go look for Katie's friends, once again leaving Cassandra and Katie to wait outside. Cassandra is still annoyed that she's being left out; Eve tries to explain, but Katie runs into the house, forcing the group to follow her. Eve grabs Katie and tells her to be quiet as there is a noise upstairs. After Eve tries to get whoever is in the house to come down and let Katie's friends go, she orders Cassandra and Katie to stay downstairs while she, Jacob, and Ezekiel check out the upstairs. Although Ezekiel protests, pointing out that this is exactly where things go wrong in horror movies, the three of them split up to investigate the rooms upstairs.

Jacob finds a piano from the late 1800s and a blood-covered crate hammer from the same era, while Ezekiel finds a room with a baby's crib and dozens of shoes of all sorts of styles, sizes, and eras, neatly lined up against the wall. Ezekiel, Eve, and Jacob all find the same photo of the house, with a family standing in front of it, their faces ripped out of the photo. Ezekiel opens a closet, finding it empty; when he turns around, a number of corpse-like hands extend out of it, reaching for him, but he walks away before they can grab him. Eve finds bloodied clothing and then sees a vision of three teens, terrified, trying to run from someone--the shadow is that of a person holding a hammer like the one Jacob found. However, when Eve turns the corner, the only person there is Jacob, and the vision vanishes.

Downstairs, Eve describes the youngsters in her vision, who Katie says are her friends. The group calls Jenkins, who tells them that the broken ley lines are contained, but also that they've stumbled into one of the Mystery Houses, the houses from which all haunted house stories originate. Jenkins tells them there are six known Mystery Houses, although the Final Rest was destroyed in 1350, and the House of Refuge was known to be benign and helpful. From what Eve tells him, he deduces that this house is the Shatterbox, which moves around, takes victims, and then moves on, and has done this since the late 1800s. Jenkins tells them they might be able to destroy the house by destroying its dark heart, which could be anything, but they only have until midnight to do this.

The group tries to figure out if they've found anything that could be the dark heart; Jacob mentions the blood-caked claw hammer, while Ezekiel says that the ""pram from 'Rosemary's Baby'"" is also upstairs. Cassandra brings Katie to Eve, and Katie tells Eve that her friends got taken out by a man like a shadow, or smoke, with a hammer or hatchet.

Upstairs, Jacob finds the hammer again, but it turns to smoke when he tries to pick it up. When he calls for Ezekiel, he doesn't get an answer. He heads back downstairs to let Eve know that Ezekiel has disappeared, but the truck is still there so he hasn't made a run for it. Katie is convinced that the hammer man got him. Jacob suggests they burn the house down, but Katie says the missing people must still be in the house. While Eve tries to figure out the best course of action, a phonograph starts playing ""What Are Little Girls Made Of"", as the team realizes that the phonograph hadn't been there before, Katie's name appears on the wall in flame and smoke. Katie panics, believing the house is now after her.

Eve tells Cassandra and Katie to leave the house, take the car, and return to Jenkins in the Annex. Cassandra wants to stay, but Eve says she and Jacob will stay because they can fight, and if they fail, at least Cassandra will remain. Cassandra and Katie go to the car, where Cassandra tells Katie that Eve doesn't trust her, as she betrayed them earlier, and that her tumour makes her useful, but unreliable. Katie says Eve trusts Cassandra, because otherwise she wouldn't have put her in charge of keeping Katie safe. As Cassandra rallies, ready to take on that responsibility, a shadowy hooded figure starts to destroy the car and the two are forced to flee back into the house.

Eve and Jacob go through the house again, with Eve getting increasingly frustrated with the way the house appears to be toying with them. They hear Cassandra and Katie screaming and run towards them. However, Jacob pauses when he notices a doll house standing on the table. He walks towards it and a dark shadow appears behind him, followed by a flash of light.

Eve, Cassandra and Katie block the door as the Hammer Man follows them, trying to break it down. When Eve calls for Stone to come help, he doesn't respond, and they realize he has also vanished.

Jacob finds himself in a house with Ezekiel, who is sitting on a comfortable chair, playing video games. As Jacob realizes that they're inside the doll house, Eve comes looking for them; he tries to get her attention, but she can't hear him, or see him when she peers into the house. Jacob gets annoyed with Ezekiel for not taking the situation seriously, while Eve gets angry and shoots the ceiling of the house, asking it what it wants.

In the doll house, Jacob says the house is trying to kill them; Ezekiel, however, disagrees, and tells Jacob to watch. Ezekiel wishes for a glass of beer, which instantly appears in his hand. He says he got bored of looking at the pictures on the wall and asked for something better to do, and the house gave him an XBox One. Jacob looks through the pictures, recognizing them as being from a wide variety of times and places--960 AD, the Crusades, and onwards--and then realizes that the same house is in all of them, although it changes itself to fit the style of the period. Ezekiel points out that in the earlier photos, the people were happy, but at some point something went wrong; Jacob realizes that they've gotten the whole thing wrong.

Downstairs, Eve, Cassandra and Katie get attacked by the Hammer Man. Eve fights him as she tells Cassandra and Katie to leave. Cassandra and Katie run for it, but Cassandra stops, deciding she needs to help her friends. Katie urges her to leave, saying they can make it to Texarkana by morning, where there's a fort, and soldiers; when Cassandra points out that they're in Slovakia, Katie calls her ""Jesse"" and says that they're in Nevada, and they need buggies, for the horses. As Cassandra tries to figure out what's going on, Katie's entire attitude shifts from scared to psychotic, and Cassandra realizes that Katie is the one behind everything. Cassandra runs back in the house, calling out for Colonel Baird, as Katie calmly follows her with a evil smile, singing.

Cassandra gets in and finds Eve's gun, and then sees a defeated Eve being dragged upstairs. Cassandra moves through the house as Katie follows her, explaining that she and her family killed a lot of people, but ended up on the run until they found the house. Katie realized that the house was a magical house, that helps her and makes her wishes come true. Cassandra realizes the house can talk to her as well, and figures out that it was a happy place until Katie's family found it, when Katie corrupted it. As Katie heads upstairs, she picks up the knife. She explains that the house has to obey her. In spite of that, it tries to save people from her.

Katie thinks she's found Cassandra, but Cassandra manages to ambush her and knock the knife out of her hand. She quickly aims Baird's gun at her and pulls the trigger, only to realize the gun is empty. The two engage in a struggle over the knife and Cassandra manages to stab Katie in the chest. As she moves backwards, she sees Katie pull out the knife. The shadow man blocks Cassandra's exit and Katie explains that she wished to become death. Cassandra tries to disarm her but Katie cuts her wrist. Cassandra begs for help, but when Katie dismisses her, Cassandra says she wasn't talking to her. Cassandra makes a wish to save her friends; however, Katie says she wishes to kill them, and she was first, so her wish will come true.

Katie tries to kill Cassandra but Cassandra suddenly wields the hatchet. She faces down Katie and tells her that she was fifteen when she was diagnosed with the tumour, and that she sees her own death every time she looks in the mirror. Katie starts panicking, claiming to be the Angel of Death, but Cassandra tells her that death doesn't look like Katie: death looks like Cassandra. She hits Katie with the hatchet. At first, Katie thinks she will heal, but a moment later, she starts to fall apart, crumbling to ash and vanishing. Cassandra passes out as she realizes the house helped her save her friends.

When she wakes up, Cassandra notices an envelope on the toy house. Inside it is a card with the words 'Thank You'.

Downstairs, Ezekiel and Jacob have been freed from the doll house, and Eve is upright and conscious, although clearly in pain and nursing a black eye. Ezekiel tries to convince the other two that they can use the house for wealth and power, given that it grants wishes. Eve, annoyed, says that she wishes she had something for her eye.

Cassandra and the Hammer Man walk in. Ezekiel and Jacob prepare to fight him. Cassandra explains the house doesn't grant wishes, it helps people in need. As she tells the others that the house is meant as a place of refuge, and had not been prepared for a family of serial killers to take advantage of it, the Hammer Man shifts into an elderly butler. As he hands Eve an ice pack for her eye, Cassandra introduces him as the spirit of the House of Refuge.

With their car fixed by the House, Eve and the Librarians prepare to leave. A newly assertive Cassandra wishes the spirit of the house goodbye and tells him to be good, then gets Ezekiel to shove over and let her drive. On speaker phone, Jenkins gives them the history of Katie's family, the Bloody Benders. A family of serial killers, they killed at least twelve people in Kansas and Nebraska in the 1800s before vanishing. Now the mystery has been solved: they found the House of Refuge, and Katie made a wish, corrupting the house. As they start the drive back, Eve falls asleep on Jacob's shoulder in the back seat, and Cassandra turns on the radio, which starts playing ""What Are Little Girls Made Of"", like the phonograph in the house. When Ezekiel reaches out to turn it off, Cassandra smacks his hand and tells him she likes the song. He leaves it on, and as they drive away, the house vanishes, and the doll house version of it appears in the trunk of the car."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3711274/?ref_=ttep_ep9,,A missing-person investigation uncovers what appears to be an alien invasion in a small rural town.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Tawnia McKiernan'],"['', '', '']",[],['alien invasion'],[],"In a path in the woods, UFO investigator Victor Finch records himself searching for the source of mysterious lights that have been reported in the sky in the area. When his recorder stops working, he puts on a pair of custom goggles, which allow him to see energy patterns. As he reaches a clearing, he notices human-like forms made of energy, only visible when he's wearing the goggles, one of which points at him. He panics and bolts from the woods into the nearby town of Collins Falls, where he makes it into his truck, but finds himself surrounded by a number of oddly-behaved townspeople, who start glowing. One of them, a diner waitress, reaches into his truck and wraps her glowing hand around his throat.

Back at the Annex, the clippings book alerts the Librarians to the disappearance of Victor Finch, sparking a debate about the existence of aliens. While Ezekiel Jones is a firm believer in UFOs, and Cassandra Cillian finds it scientifically unlikely that humans are the only intelligent life in the galaxy, Jacob Stone says that the only people who believe in UFOs are conspiracy theorists, and Jenkins firmly insists that there is no such thing as UFOs. The team continues the debate as the use the back door to reach Collins Falls, where the waitress from earlier watches them from afar. Stone notices that the houses are in a style from the late 1800s, while the town itself was only founded in 1953, and the team takes note of the gas lamps that are all over downtown. Eve Baird splits up the team to investigate, sending Cassandra and Stone to look into the town and its history, while she and Ezekiel investigate the area where Victor Finch's truck was discovered.

Cassandra and Stone find Mabel Collins working on one of the gas lamps, and after a bit of flirting with Stone, she reveals that she's not only descended from the town's founders, but also does almost everything to keep the town running: she's the town archivist, notary, volunteer fire chief, and chancellor of the exchequer. She and Stone continue to hit it off, speaking French with each other, while Cassandra gets increasingly irritated with them and tries to keep them on track.

In the woods, Ezekiel finds one of the gas lamps in a clearing, and then finds Victor Finch, who is acting very strangely. As he approaches Ezekiel, his eyes glow yellow, like the townspeople from earlier, and he raises his arm to point at Ezekiel in the same manner as the strange energy beings Finch had seen through his goggles. Baird quickly tackles Finch, knocking him into the gas lamp; he's knocked out, but the lamp and Baird both flicker, and Baird vanishes, surrounded by an electric glow.

The team regroups at the Annex, where Ezekiel insists that Baird was beamed away by aliens and Jenkins continues to insist that aliens do not exist. Using a magical device, Jenkins determines that Baird is still on the planet, but can't tell them any more than that. The Librarians return to Collins Falls to speak to Victor Finch, who can't remember anything about what happened to him. He thinks he's only been out for a day or so, and is shocked when the team tells him he's been missing for three weeks. They collect his UFO-hunting gear and bring it to Jenkins, who realizes that the goggles can be used as an aura filter, and notices strange energy in Victor's video, in the same clearing where Baird disappeared. He suggests finding out more about the gas lamps, and Stone quickly volunteers to go talk to Mabel again, while Cassandra pokes fun at him over it.

Mabel takes Stone to the town archives, which are expansive for a small, fairly recently founded town. As they go through the archives, they bond over their similar histories: they're both from small towns, and stayed put due to family obligations. Mabel says that she has a whole warehouse full of memories from the town, and that she'd like to have some from somewhere else; Stone knows exactly what she means, and they briefly come up with memories from other places that they'd like to have. She even has a wall of postcards from other places in her workspace. When Stone gets back to the investigation and brings up the unusual gas lamp, Mabel insists on going with him to see it.

In the clearing, Jenkins, Cassandra, and Ezekiel are investigating the gas lamp where Baird disappeared, and they're not prepared for an outsider to be part of the conversation. Although they make an attempt to cover up their real investigation, they falter when Jenkins touches the post and Baird flickers back into view for a moment, and Mabel doesn't buy into their claim that it was just an optical illusion. Stone convinces her to trust them and promises her that he'll tell her everything, and she agrees to go dig up anything in the archives about the gas lamps. As she leaves, the diner waitress from earlier appears in the woods.

Jenkins re-configures Victor's goggles to be more effective, and gives them to Ezekiel in hopes of tracking down the source of the strange energy. As he and Cassandra follow the energy pattern, she realizes that it forms a circuit, flowing through all the gas lamps in the town, but can't figure out what it's meant to do. As they go through the woods, Ezekiel sees Baird, who is visible only with the goggles on. She directs Cassandra to keep following the energy, while she leads Ezekiel back into town.

Meanwhile, Stone tries to sneak into the town archives, but is quickly caught by Mabel, who isn't impressed. She agrees to show him the files on the gas lamps, however, and when he looks at the town plans, he notices that the town seems to have been built around the gas lamps, implying that they were there first. Mabel tries to dismiss the idea, but Stone discovers she's also hiding parts of a gas lamp from him, and realizes that she knows more than she's telling him. She asks him for help, and when he promises to do the right thing, she hands him a folder she'd kept hidden from him. Inside is the truth of the gas lamps: they were there before the town, because another town had been there first.

Cassandra follows the energy patterns to a dam called Wardenclyffe Falls Dam, where she finds old photos, including one of Nikola Tesla. As she looks into the dam, Victor Finch appears, once again acting strangely. She realizes he's not himself and hits him with a wrench before making a break for it.

As Ezekiel makes his way through town with the goggles on, he notices that some of the townspeople have other people overlaid on top of them, made of the same energy they've been tracking. He ends up face to face with one of them, a woman in an old-fashioned outfit, who does the pointing thing like the earlier ones had, and a number of the townsfolk start chasing him when he makes a break for it. As he nears one of the gas lamps, he remembers what it did to Victor Finch, and hits it with a fence post; the townsfolk are hit with jolts of electricity and are stunned for long enough that he can get away.

Both Cassandra and Ezekiel arrive in the archives, where they find Stone and Mabel. While Ezekiel tries to figure out how to build a barricade against the body-snatchers, Stone tries to tell Cassandra about Wardenclyffe Falls, the previous town in the same location, which had been built by Tesla. She pulls him away from Mabel, although Ezekiel can see that Mabel isn't body-snatched. Victor Finch, however, is, and as he moves towards them, Mabel stops him, calling him ""Norman"". Cassandra shows Stone a photo of Mabel from 1915, and when he looks up at her, she says that these are the family commitments that kept her in town.

The Librarians, Jenkins, Mabel, and a number of the townspeople gather in the diner, where Mabel proceeds to explain exactly what happened with Wardenclyffe Falls and the people who lived there. In 1915, Tesla had been conducting experiments with wireless energy transference, and the gas lamps were a prototype transmitter. However, the experiment had gone wrong, and the people in the town had been knocked out of sync with the rest of the world. Although Tesla managed to stabilize them using the circuit made from the gas lamps, they remained trapped between dimensions, unable to interact with the real world unless they borrowed someone else's body. Only Mabel remained in her own body, as she had been insulated in the control room at the time, and Tesla had anchored her to her body with a copper knob at the base of her neck, allowing her to act as a grounding wire. Ezekiel is furious with the Wardenclyffe Falls people, pointing out that they're using other people's bodies without their consent, and that they'd taken control of Victor Finch for weeks. Mabel says that they needed someone who wasn't local so they could borrow them for longer; they had nearly found a way to fix things, but were running out of time. When Jenkins asks about their plan, Mabel offers to show them.

She leads them to the dam and explains that while Tesla hadn't been able to undo the phase shift in his lifetime, he'd built a dimensional re-integration system using the dam, which had been storing up power for a hundred years. He'd also traded the government some of his patents in return for protection for the town and the dam, allowing the townspeople to stay within the circuit. Unfortunately, the capacitor and turbines were both starting to break down, potentially leaving the townspeople trapped forever. Norman had borrowed Victor's body in order to keep things running, but his ability to fix them is limited, and there are only a couple of days left for them to activate the re-intergrator. Although there is some disagreement from Ezekiel, and Cassandra has concerns about the technology involved, the Librarians agree to help when Jenkins makes the point that this may be the only way to get Baird back.

With Cassandra taking the lead, everyone gets to work on fixing up as much of the system as they can, from the capacitor to the gas lamps. As she works on the calculations, Stone asks Mabel why she didn't leave, and she reveals that the circuit keeps her stable as well. If she'd crossed the town's border, she would have vanished. She asks him why he stayed in his home town, and he tells her about the family oil rigging business, started in the 1800s by his great-grandfather, and nearly driven into the ground by his alcoholic father. At the time, he'd felt he was obliged to stay, but now he realizes it had been an excuse; he'd stayed because everyone else had stayed, and he'd let that convince him that he couldn't leave. He and Mabel kiss, and she asks how his first kiss with a 130-year-old woman was.

Everyone finishes up their preparations, and Cassandra flips the switch to start the process. As energy begins flowing through the gas lamp circuits, Cassandra notices that the power surge is much more than she was expecting, and realizes that if the capacitor fails, it won't just blow up the lamps, but everything for hundreds of miles around them. She wants to stop the process, but Norman, still inhabiting Victor's body, tells her that they can't go on like this. He breaks the control switch and flees, locking Cassandra in the control centre. Cassandra manages to rig the system to transmit a high-frequency signal that only Ezekiel can hear, as the youngest of them; Jenkins and Stone recognize it as the Morse code for L, for Librarians. Everyone rushes to the control room and she informs them of the potential for mass destruction. Though Mabel focuses on the fact that it might still work, Cassandra says that the risk is too big, even if stopping means that they'll lose Baird forever as well. Ezekiel points out that Baird would be the first to make that call, and Stone reminds Mabel that he said he would do the right thing. She agrees, and says that there's an override switch with the relay on the roof that they can use to shut the system down.

As they head towards the roof, the energy from the dam starts to build, electrifying the fence and creating a barrier on the roof. Mabel realizes that her ability to act as a grounding wire can likely get them through it, and Stone goes with her, leaving Ezekiel to deal with the townsfolk who are coming to stop them from shutting it down. Although Mabel is able to ground the electricity, it comes at a cost; Stone ends up carrying her through the centre of the build-up. To distract her, he returns to their earlier conversation about the memories she'd like to have from other places, talking about Budapest and Paris as if they were there.

Below, Baird borrows Ezekiel's body to fight off the townspeople. As the energy build up continues to get stronger, Baird separates from Ezekiel and re-integrates. Although Ezekiel tries to call up to Stone and Mabel to let them know it's working, they can't hear him, and the electricity starts to overwhelm them. Mabel manages to reach out and shut the system down, but at the cost of her life.

Baird, Cassandra, and Ezekiel gather in the Annex to discuss what happened. Ezekiel tries to argue that it was working, but Cassandra points out that they don't know that it could have held together long enough to help the townspeople, who had been trapped for so much longer than Baird. Although the power will build up again in a hundred years, the capacitor was destroyed. Only the gas lamps still work, leaving the townspeople intact but still trapped. Eve tries to reassure everyone that they did their best, but that sometimes you just lose. As Cassandra and Ezekiel leave, Jenkins brings Eve a small book: the appointment book, used to keep track of projects for future Librarians. He suggests that the Librarians could rebuild and improve on Tesla's design, and try again once enough of a charge had built up.

In the hallway of the Annex, Cassandra and Ezekiel find Stone and ask him if he'd like to come out with them for a drink. He declines, saying he has somewhere to be. He opens the back door and reveals Paris, then pulls out Mabel's postcards, matching one to the scene in front of him before stepping through the door."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3885542/?ref_=ttep_ep10,,The changing destinies of the Librarians.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jonathan Frakes'],"['', '', '']",[],"['man tied up', 'tied to chair', 'bound and gagged', 'alternate reality', 'what if', 'parallel universe']",[],"Eve Baird wakes up, groggily, on the stones near a river. She looks up and raises her right hand which is covered in blood. Eve comes back to her senses, in what appears to be a flashback, in a pyramid where she, Ezekiel, Cassandra, and Jacob are trying to disarm a booby trap while fighting off mummies. Flynn shows up and easily turns the mummies to dust by removing their medallions, noting he must have mentioned that in his request for the team to meet him here. Eve says he did not mention that.

Flynn explains that he believes he found a way to bring back the Library and that this sarcophagus holds the key. At the Annex, Flynn further explains that the pharaohs used pyramids as passages to the afterlife. Jacob is skeptical about a doorway to heaven inside pyramids, but Jenkins explains it is similar to the doorway they have to other dimensions. Cassandra tries to calculate this dimension, but she cannot as the space is too big, even bigger then the labyrinth. Her nose starts to bleed. Jenkins mentions this door might give them access to the space where the Library is floating, and they might be able to anchor it. Jacob mentions they can use the ball of thread from the labyrinth, and the magical app from Morgan Le Fay to help get the Library back.

The group prepares a cascade of artifacts - including the story book and magical app - to power the opening of a doorway to where the Library is. The plan seems to be working when Flynn mentions to Jenkins that Jenkins was right in his notes about the pyramids. Jenkins says he never send Flynn any notes. Suddenly smoke comes out of the sarcophagus, and Dulaque and Lamia walk in. He thanks the Librarians for their help, and explains this will not just change the world but end it. Dulaque says they will need a blood sacrifice, and as Lamia grabs Flynn, Dulaque quickly stabs her in the back. She is shocked by his betrayal and says she loved him. Dulaque mentions that was necessary as he goes through the open door into an non-descript black fog. Eve and Flynn quickly chase Dulaque through the door, leaving Lamia, Ezekiel, Cassandra, and Jacob behind.

Eve and Flynn find themselves in a river, near a bridge and a weaving look. Dulaque is standing on the shore looking at the loom. Flynn realizes they are in the River of Time and Dulaque is in front of the Loom of Fate. He yells at Eve to stop Dulaque, but before they can reach the loom, Dulaque finds the stitch he's looking for and slashes into the loom.

Eve finds herself in a forest with Flynn running toward her. After being captured by armed men, Eve comes to find that Flynn has no memory of her. The soldiers check their papers, and Flynn mentions he is just a professor. Eve and Flynn then get saved by a masked martial artist, who is revealed to be Jacob. Jacob introduces himself as the Librarian, and he kisses Eve, after which she walks away saying, ""Nope, nope, nope."" Jacob talks with Flynn, who knows nothing about magic. Eve explains to them both that in her reality, Flynn is the Librarian. They discover that in this reality, Jacob became the Librarian, and Flynn never showed up for the interview. Jacob also explains that in this reality, Eve died after being the Guardian for 10 years and, presumably, being in a relationship with Jacob.

The three manage to find the mystical stones Jacob is looking for. Eve asks how she died, and Jacob explains she died preventing Dulaque from taking the Library. In this reality, without the Serpent Brotherhood to control the magic, it has become wild and technology is failing. Wars are breaking out. Jacob is using the time he has to find magical artifacts and keep them safe. As they're talking, Flynn spots a pattern in the pine trees around a henge they've found. With his knowledge, they figure out how to use the stones for teleportation. Jacob, realizing the stones can be used to teleport Eve and Flynn back to their own timeline, powers them up, making the two disappear as the soldiers close in on Jacob.

Flynn and Eve now find themselves in a building, where Flynn starts to freak out about being teleported. Ezekiel appears in a laboratory coat and explains it was magic. Flynn asks who he is, and Ezekiel introduces himself as the Librarian. Ezekiel explains they're moving between parallel universes, each with minor differences. He is also surprised to see Eve, who asks if they were lovers. Ezekiel says, no but Eve was like a mother to him as his Guardian. He explains that she died the day that Dulaque tried to take the Library. Eve is beginning to notice a pattern in her fate.

Ezekiel says that Eve and Flynn can help him with his ghost problem. He explains that the killer in the magical house made a wish and now ghosts now control most of the human population. Flynn freaks out about the situation, and Eve asks him why he didn't respond to the letter he received from the Library. Flynn explains he was comfortable at the university and it was just a twist of a Loom of Fate. This triggers Eve's memory as she realizes when Dulaque cut the fabric on the Loom, he cut through history. They hear a noise and decide to investigate as Eve tells Flynn he is the Librarian, even though he doesn't know it.

The ghosts break into the building and take over an employee while another one escapes to warn the others. Ezekiel asks Flynn and Eve for any ideas. Flynn says they can use bionic force and, assuming magic is real, he can overload the spirit energy. Ezekiel is confused, and Eve realizes Ezekiel is not skilled in history. Flynn covers that blind spot. Ezekiel and Eve hold off the ghosts while Flynn activates the system. The ghosts are hit with the energy and are forced out of the bodies they possess. The people cheer as Ezekiel thanks Flynn and says that he used magic to save the world. Eve and Flynn slowly start to disappear. Ezekiel says it was good seeing Eve again and that it was good that she brought Flynn to save his world, like it was fate. The two then disappear.

Eve and Flynn appear in a rusty building. The landscape has a tint of red, and they smell something strange - suddenly seeing a dragon fly overhead. Flynn announces he now believes in magic. Eve is confused and says they got rid off the dragons, right as Flynn gets shot in the neck with a dart. Flynn passes out as Lamia sneaks up and subdues Eve. Lamia orders two men to bring them to the boss. Eve and Flynn come to while tied to chairs. Lamia asks them who they are as Eve can not be Eve because Lamia watched her die. Eve kicks Lamia away and knocks out the men. Lamia and Eve prepare to fight but are suddenly stopped by Cassandra. Cassandra frees Flynn and welcomes Eve, noting they're not from around here. The group walks through the building, and as they pass people bow for Cassandra. She mentions she wish they do not do, but Lamia says they owe it to her as she saved them from the dragons. Lamia explains she is Cassandra's Guardian, assigned after Eve died. She also mentions she killed Dulaque after he killed Eve. Cassandra realizes Eve and Flynn are skipping through alternate timelines and says Morgan Le Fay warned her about this. Eve says she saw Dulaque cut the loom. Eve says that, in her reality, Dulaque wanted to go back to the time of Camelot. Flynn says that the timeline will restart from where you cut it. Cassandra explains Dulaque wanted history to restart at the height of his power and the power of magic. However he didn't reweave the fabric of history after he made the cut it, so history is coming apart.

Cassandra continues that Eve and Flynn are skipping from thread to thread, each containing another path the world could have taken. Eve asks how Cassandra she can control all this magic. Cassandra explains that when her brain tumor grew she used magic to save her life. She says history will continue to unravel until all time is undone. Cassandra says she lost and that she will evacuate this world as Morgan Le Fay thought her how to open doors in other dimension. Seeing Cassandra give up, Flynn tells her the other Librarians they've encountered did not give up. Cassandra says he is a Librarian and Flynn says he would have become one if he could go back and choose again.

Flynn proposes that they could reweave the threads together. Cassandra says they need something powerful and Eve mentions the rope of the labyrinth. Eve searches the Annex in Cassandra's reality, which was never opened before, but the rope is nowhere to be found. Presumably, the labyrinth was never destroyed in this reality. Cassandra mentions to Flynn that although he cares for Eve, she will die for him in the end. Flynn realizes they can reweave the threads like a rope, however they need the Librarians from the nearest 2 threads to start the process. Cassandra brings Jacob and Ezekiel from the previous alternate timelines to her thread, and the three work together to transport the group back to Eve's reality.

Eve gets the ball of thread and a sword. Cassandra says they can go through the Annex doors to reach the Loom of Fate. Eve and Flynn thank the group and move to go through the doors. Flynn stops and realizes that if they reweave the threads, these versions of Cassandra, Ezekiel, and Jacob will cease to exist - having been trapped in Eve's reality instead of their own. The three alternate timeline Librarians recite the mantra of the Librarians back to Flynn and say they've had interesting lives. Eve and Flynn go through the door.

Back at the River of Time, Flynn rushes toward the Loom of Fate. Eve cautions that Dulaque could still be nearby, as a younger version of Dulaque shows up and knocks them down. Dulaque explains that this is what he looked like during the time of Camelot. He says it was a perfect world with one king and magic. He then stabs Eve in the chest and she collapses to the ground. Shocked, Flynn grabs the sword and tries to fight Dulaque. Dulaque easily beats him and says there is only one swordsman his equal. He tries to kill Flynn but his sword is blocked. Jenkins appears to fight Dulaque, now revealed to be Lancelot and Jenkins is Galahad. Dulaque tries to convince Jenkins this is the best way forward, but Jenkins says that it was the fate of Camelot to fall.

While they fight, Flynn is able to reweave the Loom. Dulaque disappears while Flynn becomes the version of himself from Eve's reality. He rushes to Eve, bleeding on the rocks. Jenkins, Eve, and Flynn go back to the Annex where the other three remain. Flynn uses the story book to pull the Library back to them. Opening the doors they confirm the Library is back. Flynn rushes through the shelves as Eve weakens. He finds a magic potion to revive Eve just as her heart stops beating. Eve accepted it was her fate to die, but Flynn says he does not believe in fate. The group looks at the library as Flynn says it feels like home.

Flynn tells the group they've graduated and they can do missions on their own. Eve hands them small versions off the clipping book, and says they can go solo or team up on missions. Ezekiel and Jacob are unsure about staying now that the Library is back. Cassandra says she would like to try a case and opens the book. She says she's going to Lima and Jacob and Ezekiel decide to tag along.

Eve goes to thank Jenkins, but he says he doesn't remember what happened and Eve was probably the only one able to keep her mind intact. He speculates it was because her mind has experience moving across time from when she spread goodwill over the earth during the Christmas. Jenkins notes that was almost like fate. Flynn and Eve open the clipping book and it shows a huge disaster about to happen. As they prepare to step through the door, Flynn asks her on a date. Eve asks if this is his idea of a date, and the two step through the door smiling."
