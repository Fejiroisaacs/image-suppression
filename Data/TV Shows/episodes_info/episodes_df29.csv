The present is a trip to a spa in Callistoga.

Piper,Phoebe and Prue talking about Andy Mark, a young Chinese man, is celebrating his birthday. His mother worries about him, and urges him to take a protection amulet with him. He assures her that he can take care of himself. He is accosted by four thugs, one of whom draws a revolver and shoots him. As Mark's ghost rises above his body, one of the thugs puts his ring on Mark's hand. The thugs douse Mark's body with gasoline and set it alight.

Phoebe and Piper plan a surprise party for Prue. Phoebe goes to the Neptune Hotel to take a job as a psychic, in order to pay for a present for Prue. She gets a vision from the manager and lands the job.

Piper meets Phoebe at the hotel, worried about Phoebe's use of her powers. Mark's ghost shows up and only Piper and Phoebe can see him. Piper leaves and Mark pursues her; she doesn't believe him until a bicyclist rides right through him.

Prue finds Andy at Quake with his ex-wife. Prue walks away angry and flings a cart into his path.

Mark tells Piper that his body must be found before Yama catches him and takes him to Hell. As soon as they find his body, Yama appears. Piper freezes Yama and she and Mark flee. Yama unfreezes and lowers his lance, but Mark and Piper are gone.

At the hotel, a man named Mr. Correy leaves his wallet behind. Phoebe picks it up and sees the man being hit by a car. She tries to warn him, but he is suspicious.

Prue finds flowers on her desk and Andy waiting in her office. He apologizes for not telling Prue about his ex-wife.

Piper goes to Mark's mother. Mark gives her the Chinese translation of what Piper needs to say to her. Piper is unwilling to tell Mark's mother that he is dead. Mark tries to enter the house, but the amulet repels him.

Prue uses her telekinesis on a food cart. (Click for animation) Mark's body is found, but identified as Tony Wong, a Chinatown crime lord. Phoebe gets a vision and draws two Chinese characters. Mark identifies a Chinatown warehouse. He and Piper go to the warehouse. Piper enters an upstairs room and freezes the three men inside. She places a newspaper in Tony Wong's hands, the headline clearly reading TONY WONG FOUND DEAD. She takes a photo and the men unfreeze. Tony Wong gets Piper's license plate number as she and Mark drive away. Piper slips the photo into Andy's interoffice mail. Phoebe pursues Mr. Correy, who walks out of the hotel. The car almost hits him, but Phoebe tackles him and pushes him out of the way.

Two of Tony Wong's thugs break into the manor and drag Piper off. Mark tells Phoebe and Prue and the three leave in search of Piper. Tony tells Piper that he had faked his death and was planning to flee to Hong Kong. Andy finds Tony's picture, with the newspaper in his hands. Phoebe and Prue enter the upstairs room. Piper freezes a bullet in flight and Prue flings Tony downstairs. Tony runs out and the police surround him. A cop shoots Tony.

The Charmed Ones barring Mark from Yama Tony's ghost meets Mark's as Yama appears. Mark shoves Tony onto Yama's lance. Yama tries to claim Mark, but the Charmed Ones bar this action way.

Late that night, Berman appears in Skye's dream. They go to a surreal building-top landscape. He twirls her around and then throws her off the building, killing Skye for real. Andy and Darryl find her body. Although she is still in bed and the door is locked, nearly every bone in her body is broken, as if she jumped off a building. Berman attacks Skye in her dreams Piper and Phoebe cast a love spell. Wind blows through the attic, but nothing else seems to happen. The telephone rings, but the caller is Berman and he is looking for Prue. She refuses him again. Phoebe leaves for Quake to see if the spell worked.

Prue is enjoying a bubble bath and falls asleep. Berman appears; Prue denies that he is real. Berman is able to read Prue's thoughts, memories, etc. He grabs a sponge and rubs Prue's back with it so hard that she bleeds. He then tries to drown her, but Piper knocks and wakes Prue up. Prue sees the scratches on her back. Piper suspects that Prue is merely overworked.

Prue attacked while taking a bath A large, muscular man walks into the kitchen, where Prue and Piper are talking, followed by a very happy Phoebe. The man's name is Hans and had come into Quake to use a pay phone, and bumped into Phoebe there and they hooked up. At Quake, a regular customer, Jack, asks Piper to have dinner with him. Another asks her to fly to Paris with him. Andy and Darryl have found several other young women dead in the same way as Skye. They visit a ""dream lab"" where Berman works. The first woman had been Berman's girlfriend. Berman had been in the lab when Skye died.

Piper has dinner with Jack and tries to turn him off, but he is insistent, and kisses her. Several other men try to get her attention. Piper now thinks the spell wasn't such a good idea.

Hans and Phoebe kiss Berman enters the dream lab and asks for an extra dose of the drug that sends him into dreaming sleep. Prue has fallen asleep at her desk and Berman enters her dream. He tells her she's powerless against him; he knows that she's a witch because he can get inside her mind. Prue stabs Berman with a letter opener and he is about to throw her off the building when the telephone rings--it's Andy, calling to check up on her. Prue hears someone coming and whirls around with the letter opener--but it's Rex. Prue looks down and sees Berman's blood on the tip of the letter opener.

Andy has learned what Berman is researching: ""dream leaping"". He says the girlfriend had died just after breaking up with Berman.

Prue using her power on the Dream Sorcerer Phoebe comes home to find flowers everywhere, from men whom Piper has never met. Hans was all over Phoebe and she ditched him. Even Kit has tomcats after her. The two decide to reverse the spell.

Prue drives home and falls asleep at the wheel. Hans appears at the door, angry, and Piper freezes him. Piper and Phoebe leave in search of Prue, who has driven into a pole. Prue is taken to a hospital. She is only semi-conscious and Berman appears to her again. Andy and Darryl visit Berman again and order the techs to wake him up. Piper and Phoebe reach the hospital and get into Prue's room. Realizing what is happening, they encourage her to use her power on Berman. Prue

Piper and Phoebe with Prue at the hospital flings Berman over the ledge, and Berman dies before Andy and Darryl's eyes. Prue regains consciousness. Piper and Phoebe reverse the love spell and none of their suitors remember anything.

Later Prue is recuperating in the hospital and is visited by Phoebe, Piper and Andy."

Elliot's mother, Grace Spencer, joins them and asks if they've gotten a marriage license yet. Just then, a mysterious blonde appears in the driveway. The woman, Jade, reminds Mrs. Spencer that 20 years earlier, they made a pact in which Mrs. Spencer would receive great wealth and power in return for her eldest son's hand in marriageand Jade is now here to collect. Jade gestures and Elliot collapses.

Phoebe's premonition of the demon child being born. Piper takes a pregnancy test. She fears she may be carrying the child of Jeremy Burns (""Something Wicca This Way Comes""), her ex-boyfriend who proved to be a warlock. Phoebe finds the box in the trash and has a vision of a demon child being born. Piper prepares to cater the Spencer wedding. She is stretched thin, especially since Chef Moore, who was originally supposed to cater the wedding, is in Europe. Piper asks Phoebe for help. As Piper enters the Spencer estate, a priest, Father Trask, appears. He tries to warn Piper of Hecate, as security guards throw him out.

Prue is in the midst of cataloging a fertility icon. It's mere presence is supposed to ensure a woman conceives. Rex walks in and says the goddess is no longer available, and reminds Hannah that it was acquired for someone else. Phoebe drops into Prue's office, and tells Prue about her premonition.

Allison demands an explanation for why Elliot is suddenly due to marry Jade, but Grace only says that Jade is an old family friend and gives Allison the brushoff.

Phoebe and Piper learn of the change of bride. They go to meet her and Grace. The two are alarmed that Chef Moore won't be handling the wedding, but Piper and Phoebe reassure them. A seamstress is altering Jade's dress and sticks her with a pin, but Jade doesn't even flinch.

Allison manages to sneak into Elliot's room. Just as they start to talk, Grace, Jade and Kirsten, one of the bridesmaids, walk in and hustle her back out. Elliot begs Kirsten not to harm Allison, and a visibly, angry Jade pulls him back into the room.

Father Trask sneaks back into the estate in a delivery truck. He puts on a deliveryman's uniform and takes a large dagger with him. He finds Jade and raises the dagger, calling her Hecate. However, Jade doesn't seem to be at all alarmed. Kirsten fades in behind Father Trask. She morphs into a demon and breaks his neck. Jade has him thrown from her window.

Phoebe and Piper discover the priests body. Piper and Phoebe run into Allison, who tells them of her plight. Piper wants to help; she thinks this is something they're supposed to do as good witches.

Jade tells Andy and Darryl that Trask had lunged at her with the knife, but she ducked out of the way and he flew out the window. The two cops are skeptical, as Trask had landed too far from the window.

Prue wants to know if the fertility icon's male counterpart can still be catalogued, and Rex approves. He mentions the female icon was a gift for Elliot's bride. Prue says that Piper is catering that wedding, but she won't be going. Rex runs into Hannah, and confirms that Prue won't be there. However, he thinks it's too risky for them to go.

Prue is pulling an inventory tag off the male icon's ""artifact"", when Andy walks in with the dagger. She reads an inscription on its blade: ""Nec prius absistit quoad protero prodigium"", which she translates as ""I shall not rest until the demon is vanquished"" (though more adequate translation would be: ""The demon will not rest until I have vanquished him.""). She searches the Web on her laptop, and finds out about Hecate.

Prue draws Hecate into the dagger with her power. The dagger is actually a poingnard, which is the only thing that can destroy her. Piper notes that the napkins and the catering contract both mention Allison, not Jade. Phoebe tells Piper of her vision, and Piper assures her that she's not pregnant. Phoebe realizes that she had not in fact seen Piper in her vision. Prue tells what she has found out about Hecate -- and that based on her research, Jade is really Hecate in human form. Hecate comes to Earth every 200 years so she can marry the first-born son of a prominent family and use him to have a child. The child may look human, but will be pure demon.

The sisters spy on Jade's bachelorette party. A ""pizza deliveryman"" comes in, and starts taking off his clothes. Jade and the bridesmaids approach -- and then Jade sinks her claws into the stripper, killing him.

The next day, the sisters make plans to crash the wedding. Allison can break Hecate's spell with a declaration of true love, sealed with a kiss.

Prue and Andy leave to talk Prue calls Allison to the manor and convinces her to crash the wedding. Phoebe and Piper talk to Mrs. Spencer, who seems to agree to stop the wedding. She tells Piper and Phoebe to meet her in the wine cellar. Piper and Phoebe slip into the cellar, but two of the bridesmaids follow them. Piper tries, unsuccessfully, to freeze the bridesmaids, but she's too far away. Piper and Phoebe run and hide. Prue and Allison reach the Spencer estate; Prue calls Piper's cell phone and Piper tells her where she is. Piper, at last, freezes the bridesmaids as Prue enters the cellar and flings them into a wall. The sisters and Allison interrupt the wedding. Jade raises a windstorm and grabs Elliot, while the guests scatter.

The sisters find Jade and Elliot in an upstairs room, just as Jade is morphing into her demon form and about to impregnate Elliot. The bridesmaids, also in demon form, rush in after them. Prue cannot find the dagger it's on the floor next to Elliot. Elliot raises the dagger, and Prue draws Jade and the bridesmaids into it. The wedding proceeds with Allison. Andy stops by and Prue gives him the dagger."

She chants and Kali appears in a mirror. Aviva has been studying the Charmed Ones at Kali's instruction. Aviva reaches for the mirror and Kali grants her a power.

Aviva conjures Kali Kali tells Aviva to go to the sisters. As Aviva leaves, flames shoot up behind Kali, and her eyes turn fiery red. Kit has gone missing for several days. Leo looks up the fireplace for her while Piper checks him out. Phoebe walks into the living room and also eyeballs Leo. Piper offers Leo a snack, but Leo wants to puts out flyers the sisters have printed up for Kit. Aviva sees one of the flyers and sets it on fire just by looking at it.

Piper brings Leo a snack just as Prue and Phoebe come downstairs. Leo is painting a wall. Phoebe tries to hit on Leo. Prue notices, and pulls Phoebe into the kitchen. Prue knows that Piper is falling in love with Leo, and suspects Phoebe is trying to steal him away like she believes Phoebe tried to steal Roger.

The girls check out Leo's ""Bottom"". Piper comes in, and Phoebe asks if she thinks she steals their boyfriends. Piper accuses Phoebe of stealing one of hers back in high school. Prue heads out to get ready for a night with Andy and reminds Piper and Phoebe that she wants the manor to herself tonight. Piper and Phoebe agree to a friendly competition of sorts for Leo's affection. Aviva is writing in her diary when her Aunt Jackie walks in. Aviva is staying at Aunt Jackie's place while her mother is in rehab, and Aviva is upset that Aunt Jackie won't call or visit her. Aunt Jackie, in turn, doesn't understand why Aviva is so hostile to her.

Prue and Andy look through a video store for a movie. Andy is increasingly frustrated that they can never have any time with each other before something comes up that calls Prue away.

Aviva brings Kit back. Aviva summons Kali again. Kali tells Aviva she must get the sisters to accept her into their coven. The closet door opens and Kit is there. Kali tells Aviva to take Kit back to the manor.

Piper walks in on Leo finishing up and asks him if he wants to go see a movie. Aviva arrives with Kit; she claims to have found her two hours ago and fed her before coming over. Piper offers a reward, but Aviva declines. Prue and Andy walk in. Prue offers to pay Aviva, but instead Aviva blurts out that she wants to talk about magical stuff. The sisters try to shoo Aviva out, but Aviva instead makes Andy's popcorn tray start popping. Piper freezes the room but Aviva doesn't freeze.

Aviva wants to try a spell with Phoebe. Aviva wants to explain, but the sisters aren't interested. Prue brusquely orders her out. Aviva sets the tape Prue is holding ablaze and walks out just as the room unfreezes and popcorn blasts out all over Andy and Leo. Kali doesn't seem surprised that Prue shooed Aviva out. She thinks that Phoebe will be more understanding, however. Aviva is a bit nervous, but Kali reminds her that she was the one who wanted a family. In return, Kali wants to be able to tap into the magic of the Halliwell line.

The next morning, Prue tries to patch things up with Andy, and talks him into coming over that night.

Prue visits Aunt Jackie. Prue is still very angry at Aviva, but Phoebe points out that Aviva did bring Kit back. Prue suspects Aviva might be a warlock, but Piper points out that Aviva didn't freeze, which means she may very well be a good witch like them. Prue is still suspicious, and points out she might very well be evil. She talks Piper and Phoebe into keeping their distance from Aviva until they can find out more about her. As Prue and Piper head for work, Aviva calls Phoebe. Later that day, Phoebe and Aviva meet at Aviva's school. Aviva cuts the rest of the day and offers to tell Phoebe about herself.

Phoebe having the premonition of Prue being attacked by Aviva Leo comes to Quake to show Piper some samples of the stain originally used on the manor doors. Piper pays for the meal. Leo wonders if Phoebe works there, but Piper scoffs, suggesting that Phoebe is a lesbian. Later that night, Phoebe is showing Aviva around the manor. Phoebe tells Aviva that she and Piper are fighting over Leo. Aviva suggests that Phoebe tilt the odds by casting a spell on Leo. Phoebe wonders how Aviva knows that the sisters are witches. Aviva tells Phoebe that she's being trained by a high priestess. Phoebe wants to meet her, and they go up to Phoebe's room. Kali briefly appears in the mirror. Aviva has Phoebe touch a dead plant, and it comes back to life. Prue walks in on them and is angry to see Aviva there. Aviva tries to drive a wedge between Prue and Phoebe. As Phoebe tries to calm Prue down, Andy arrives; another night is ruined.

Phoebe taking the attack meant for Prue They agree to try again at Quake the next day. Aviva walks out.

Kali thinks that they'd have lured Phoebe to their side if Prue hadn't been around. Aviva is angry at Prue. Just then, Aunt Jackie barges in; she found out Aviva cut school and wants some answers. They argue, and Kali gestures, causing several candles to flare up. One of them sets Aunt Jackie's dress on fire. Aunt Jackie tries frantically to smother the flames, but falls down the stairs and is knocked out.

While the paramedics tend to Aunt Jackie, Kali tells Aviva to go back to the sisters. She's convinced that Phoebe is already on their side, and Piper will easily be won over. She wants Aviva to kill Prue and take her place in the Power of Three. Aviva goes to the manor and convinces the sisters to let her stay the night, promising not to use any magic.

Kali possesses Aviva Aviva is sleeping with Phoebe in Phoebe's room. Kali appears late at night and tells Aviva to go after Prue. Aviva tries to slip into Prue's room, but Piper finds her just as she raises a fireball. Aviva says she's looking for the bathroom and walks away.

The next morning, Prue visits Aunt Jackie in the hospital. Aunt Jackie tells of the strange chants and rituals that Aviva indulges in. At Quake, Piper can't raise Prue, even though Andy is there waiting for her. At that moment, Prue is in Aviva's room and finds Aviva's diary, and reads about her and Kali's plans to take over the sisters' coven.

The Charmed Ones vanquish Kali Prue calls Phoebe and tells her to call Piper, and to not let Aviva out of her sight. Aviva feigns exhaustion and goes up to Prue's room. Leo is sanding down a corner in the foyer, and wonders if Phoebe and Aviva are in a relationship. Phoebe scoffs, and suggests that Piper is on medication. She picks up Aviva's jacket and gets a premonition of Aviva throwing a fireball at Prue. She rushes upstairs, and Aviva throws a fireball. It hits Aviva's jacket and sets it ablaze. Horrified at she has done Aviva runs out the door. Phoebe is slightly burned on the arm. Prue, Piper and Leo are tending to her. Phoebe says that her sweater got too close to one of Aviva's candles. Leo heads out to get an estimate on his work. Phoebe tells Prue and Piper what really happened. Prue tells them that she thinks Kali is an evil spirit that is using Aviva. The sisters head for the attic.

Aviva is packing her witch stuff in a backpack; she doesn't want to use her powers anymore. Kali offers to leave if Aviva touches the mirror; instead, she possesses Aviva.

As a friendly gesture, they give Aviva a dress The sisters find Kali in the Book of Shadows. She is an evil sorceress who appears in reflections, like mirrors. She uses innocents as pawns to kill witches and take their powers. The only way to vanquish her is to ""shatter her reflection."" At that moment, Kali, in Aviva's body, enters the attic and throws fireballs all over the place. Aviva momentarily gains control only long enough to shout for help before Kali takes control again. Phoebe suggests that Piper freeze Kali. Piper is skeptical, since Aviva can't freeze. However, Phoebe thinks that Kali will freeze. Piper freezes Kali, ejecting her from Aviva. Prue flings Kali into a mirror, and Phoebe smashes it, destroying Kali.

The sisters give Aviva one of Prue's old dresses. Aviva admits she's going to miss her powers. Phoebe swears Aviva to secrecy.

The man, Gavin, speaks fulsomely about Dr. Mitchell's work and then opens a third eye on his forehead. A ray comes from the third eye and burns through Dr. Mitchell's skull, killing him. The sisters are getting ready to see a movie when Piper's boss at Quake, Martin, calls her inon her day off. A convention is in town and Quake is short-staffed. Prue and Phoebe are worried; Piper's been working a crazy schedule of late.

The sisters head to the movies, but Phoebe gets a premonition of Tanya being killed. She was supposed to talk to Martin about it weeks ago, but never got around to it. Phoebe happens to bump into Gavin and gets a premonition of a woman being killed. The police arrive and the sisters find Dr. Mitchell's dead body. Phoebe thinks her vision was of the next murder. Piper and Phoebe continue to argue over Leo. Prue thinks Phoebe only likes Leo because Piper does. Prue is unwilling to talk to Andy, feeling it's too soon after they broke up. Phoebe goes in her place to ask about Dr. Mitchell's murder. Prue looks through the Book of Shadows, but can't find anything. As she leaves, the Book flips on its own to a truth spell. Prue is skeptical and closes it back, only to see it reopen to the spell.

The Book of Shadows opens to the Truth Spell page Martin overworks Piper, and she doesn't complain.

Phoebe has talked to Darryl about the case. She passed Andy in the parking lot and tells Prue that he still cares about her. Phoebe also suggests that Prue tell Andy that she's a witch, if only to see how he handles it.

Prue casts the truth spell, not knowing that Phoebe and Piper are in the house and will also be affected. She calls Andy, but only reaches his answering machine. Piper asks if Phoebe can see a pimple on her chin. Phoebe is initially reluctant to answer, but just then the spell takes effect and to her shock says she can see it after all. Piper admits she didn't tell off Martin.

Prue recites the Truth Spell Gavin walks into a laboratory and finds Alex Pearson working there. He kills Alex with the third eye, but not before Alex rips a button off of Gavin's coat. Phoebe and Piper notice that they are unable to lie. Phoebe admits that she only likes Leo because Piper does. Prue admits to casting the truth spell, to determine if Andy is okay with her being a witch. For the next 24 hours, anyone who comes in contact with them will have no choice but to tell the truth.

Phoebe goes to Andy and asks him about the murders. Andy tells what he knows. Both of the victims had the same burn mark on their forehead, and it looked like all the life had been sucked out of them. He mentions the button, and says it's made of a strange alloy never seen before. She leaves, and Andy calls Prue. He offers to meet after interviewing a witness.

Phoebe and Piper are also affected by the Truth Spell. Just as Prue gets off the phone with Andy, Tanya Parker, the sandwich girl, stops by her office. Hannah follows, and snatches a sandwich Tanya was saving for Prue. Under the influence of the spell, Hannah admits that her mission in life is to destroy Prue. Rex pulls her aside and warns her to keep quiet. Hannah lights Rex's cigar, apparently with a magical power, by blowing on it.

Piper is called into Quake yet again. Leo comes in, asking to use the washing machine. Piper asks if Leo thinks of her; he does, and thinks Piper has beautiful eyes. She asks, ""What do you think about women who make the first move?"" Leo says, ""Im still waiting for it to happen."" and Piper kisses him.

Rex stops by the elevator to check on Prue. Under the influence of the spell, Prue nearly blurts out that she's a witch, but Phoebe cuts her off. Just as Phoebe despairs of finding the woman in her premonition, she sees Tanya walking by and recognizes her as the woman.

Piper makes the first move Phoebe rushes down to stop Gavin while Prue calls security. Phoebe finds Gavin and Tanya struggling, with Gavin getting the better of it. Just as Gavin starts to blast Tanya, Phoebe smashes a bottle over his head. They drive off to the manor. Phoebe explains that the man who attacked her was a demon. Tanya tries to run, but Phoebe convinces her to stay. Piper is overworked. Martin, under the spell, admits to overworking her to keep from spending money on more employees. Piper angrily quits.

Andy goes to Prue at Buckland. Prue demonstrates her power and explains that she is a witch. Andy becomes uncomfortable.

Prue shows Andy she is Telekinetic A biogenetics professor at Stanford has been killed. Three of the victims work in the biotech field, Piper and Phoebe don't see how they're connected to Tanya, a sandwich girl. Phoebe touches Tanya and gets a premonition of Tanya holding a newborn baby. Phoebe realizes that Tanya is pregnant, and also remembers the button the police found wasn't made of anything the cops had seen before. Phoebe suspects Gavin is from the future--and isn't after Tanya, but her baby.

Gavin comes into Prue's office. Under the influence of the truth spell, Gavin admits that he is from the future. He was sent to kill Tanya to keep her baby from being born, since he will someday create a vaccine.

Prue and Piper spear Gavin His other victims will help with the research that creates the vaccine. Gavin realizes something's up and charges at Prue, but she pins him against the wall with her desk and escapes. Piper can't reach Prue at work, and heads to Buckland's to check on her. Prue flees into a warehouse and hides from Gavin. Piper finds Prue's office empty. Prue asks Gavin what the vaccine is for and he admits that the vaccine will destroy warlocks like him. Gavin finds Prue and grabs her by the neck. He's about to blast her when Piper rushes in and freezes him, freeing Prue. Gavin unfreezes and the two shove a crowbar into his third eye, killing him.

Prue goes to Andy and asks how he feels about her being a witch. He is still uncomfortable. The truth spell expires in that moment and Andy doesn't remember what they were talking about, nor that Prue is a witch.

Andy and Prue break up Prue walks away. Martin, likewise, doesn't remember that Piper quit her job and orders her into the kitchen while she is having dinner with Prue. She demands that Martin hire some more people or she will quit. He agrees, to Piper's surprise, and she walks out of the kitchen. As she leaves, she smacks the door into Leo, who apparently does not remember the kiss. Piper offers to buy Leo a drink. Prue enters Quake and tells Phoebe about the rejection from Andy. Phoebe hugs Prue to comfort her."

(In the real Salem witch trials, no one was burned; all convicted ""witches"" were hanged.) Matthew Tate, her former lover, visits her in her cell. He seduced her, copied her powers and then outed her as a witch to keep from being exposed as a warlock. Melinda pulls off the locket Matthew gave her as a gift and gives it back to him. Matthew says he plans to copy other witches' powers as well. He opens the locket and pulls out a piece of paper. Suddenly, the paper disintegrates. Before Matthew can figure out what is happening, Melinda recites a curse, and Matthew disappears into the locket.

Prue frees Matthew In the present, at Buckland's Auction House, Rex Buckland presents the locket to Prue, telling her it's part of a large estate from the east. She opens it and Matthew appears. Realizing that Prue couldn't have opened it unless she was a descendant of Melinda, Matthew tries to attack her, but Prue sends him flying across the room. Matthew thanks Prue, because he now has her power of telekinesis. He pins her against the wall with a chair, then disappears and reappears behind her to finish her off. Believing that Prue inherited all of Melinda's powers, he grabs her again and tries to goad her into freezing him. Prue tells him she doesn't have that ability. Matthew releases her, blows out a window, and jumps, landing safely on his own two feet. The cops arrive, including Darryl and Andy; Andy knows that the blown-out window is Prue's.

Leo is repairing the kitchen sink. Phoebe urges Piper to ask him out, but she is reluctant.

It turns out that Rex and Hannah provided Prue with the locket. The warlock-couple is after the Charmed Ones' powers, and plan to use Matthew to get them.

Prue goes to Phoebe and Piper and tells them of Matthew Tate. Phoebe takes the locket and has a vision of Melinda putting Matthew in the locket.

Phoebe's premonition A lawyer named Arnold Halliwell is on the phone when the door to his office suddenly swings open. Before Arnold Halliwell can figure out what is happening, Matthew blinks in and telekinetically pins him up against the wall and demands to know where Arnold's ""sisters"" are -- but Arnold Halliwell shares only a name with the Charmed Ones. Matthew telekinetically breaks Arnold Halliwell's neck and walks away. The sisters consult the Book of Shadows and find Matthew. They find out that he was never supposed to be let out of the locket, since he would likely be hellbent on destroying the Warren line.

Andy appears at the manor to question Prue. Phoebe answers the door and won't let him in. He tells her of the murdered lawyer and wants to know where Prue is. She demands a warrant and he leaves. The sisters are at a loss as to how to handle Matthew. Phoebe tells them that she found a spell to summon Melinda so they can ask her for help. They cast the spell, and Melinda appears in 17th century dress. They redress her so she can blend in. Leo shows up and the sisters introduce Melinda as their cousin.

Matthew runs into Rex and Hannah at a ""Halliwell Hardware and Appliance"", where Matthew has murdered the proprietor. Rex and Hannah offer to find the Charmed Ones for him.

Melinda tells the sisters of her arrest and burning. She had not used her powers to escape so that her daughter, Prudence, would not be found out as a witch as well. She tells them of Matthew's ability to copy a good witch's power and become immune to it. When Prue asks her about Matthew's ""wild power,"" Melinda tells him that it's called blinking--the ability to think of a location and literally be there ""in the blink of an eye."" She mentions that Matthew copied that power from another witch. Melinda proposes to curse Matthew back into the locket.

Matthew changes into more modern clothes to blend in, and is amazed at how ""closed"" things are in the 20th century. He appears to be making a pass at Hannah when Rex comes in and snaps them all back to task. He tells Melinda that Matthew goes back in the locket as soon as the sisters are dead.

The four witches consult the Book of Shadows and find the curse. Melinda is amazed at how big the Book has gotten since she started it. Phoebe finds it hard to believe that they'll be able to add to it eventually. Piper thinks she can get most of the ingredients at Quake. However, one ingredient they can't get is a spotted owl feather; Prue offers to get it.

Rex shows Matthew pictures of the sisters and the address of Quake, and has Hannah take him to Quake.

Prue knows there's a stuffed spotted owl at the Museum of Natural History, where she used to work. She offers to get the feather there. Unknown to Prue, Andy is following her.

Matthew is after Piper, but finds Phoebe instead. He grabs her and she has a vision of him attacking Melinda. Matthew now has her power, and knows the sisters summoned Melinda. Phoebe calls the manor trying to find Prue. Only Melinda is there, and she does not know how telephones work. Matthew comes to the manor and confronts Melinda. He tries to goad Melinda into freezing him, but Melinda won't go along. Matthew grabs Melinda by the neck, and has a vision of the four witches cursing him back in the locket.

Melinda cursing Matthew back into the locket He demands to know where Prue is, and Melinda sends him to the zoo. Matthew vows to break Melinda's spirit by killing the sisters, then killing her last. He blinks out. Rex knows Hannah lost track of Matthew; he magically followed her.

Piper and Phoebe arrive at the manor to find Melinda badly shaken. Melinda says Prue is taking care of the feather.

Prue is heading out of the museum when Andy nabs her and takes her to his car.

Matthew flings Hannah through the door of Rex's office. Matthew is hellbent on killing Prue. Rex tries to get him to focus on Piper and Phoebe, but Matthew tells him that the sisters summoned Melinda and are trying to curse him back into the locket. Rex suspects they'll have to speak the curse in the manor--and if he goes there, he can copy Piper's freezing power and kill them all. He hands Matthew a pistol.

Andy grills Prue about the feather. Just as he's about to take her to the station, Prue sets off the airbag in his car and escapes. Matthew comes to the manor and confronts Piper, Phoebe and Melinda. He draws Piper toward him and points the pistol at her, trying to goad her into freezing him. Just in time, Prue comes in and flings the pistol from Matthew's hand. She then pins him to the ground with a chair. Prue adds the feather to the potion. Piper freezes Matthew just as he gets up. Melinda speaks the curse and sends Matthew back into the locket.

Matthew has failed to steal the Charmed Ones' powers, but Rex and Hannah now know that they are the Charmed Ones. Hannah says that they should have gone after the Charmed Ones directly, and Rex admits they should have.

Andy wants to arrest Prue, but Darryl talks him out of it.

Piper asks Leo out. The sisters speak a spell and send Melinda back to among the dead, but not she grants Phoebe a vision of her many future descendants -- ""daughters"", she says, though that will turn out not to be entirely true. Melinda takes the locket with her--likely trapping Matthew for eternity."

Piper looks at all the clothes Prue bought and wonders if she's simply drowning her sorrows over losing Andy, but Phoebe pulls out a naughty-looking piece of lingerie that suggests Prue's over that loss. Piper shoos them away; she never knows how long her freezes hold. Piper runs back to Leo just as he unfreezes, and they run upstairs.

Prue and Phoebe bust Leo and Piper As Prue is undressing in her room, a ghostly Rex Buckland appears behind her. He tells her to pull a tiara out of her briefcase, and that she believes it's her date book. Kit sees Rex and hisses at him, but Prue doesn't know why. Back at Buckland's, Rex tells Hannah that their plan to frame Prue is well underway, and that this is the second time he's used his new power of astral projection to help it along; he used it earlier to trick Prue into taking the tiara from the vault. Hannah still doesn't understand how it works, so Rex uses it to get her to take off her dress.

The next morning, Piper gets up late and is on her way to work when Prue and Phoebe make her spill the beans about the night with Leo. Piper says it's been a while since she had sex, so she ended up freezing Leo several times, much to Prue and Phoebe's amusement.

Prue and Phoebe bump into Jaime, a security guard at Buckland's. He tells them of the missing tiara. Rex offers to take Phoebe to see The Verve. Darryl and Andy ask to see the security tapes.

Andy questions Prue about the theft of the tiara. She remembers nothing of stealing a tiara. Darryl is suspicious, in no small part because the security tape from the vault is missing.

Andy and Darryl appear at the manor with a search warrant. They search a bedroom and Piper spots the tiara as Andy opens a drawer. She freezes the room and moves the tiara to under a pillow.

Rex in astral form with Prue Rex projects in and tells Andy to look under the pillow. Darryl looks under the pillow and Piper freezes the room again. Piper moves the tiara into a dresser, but Rex suggests to Andy that he check there. Piper freezes the room again and Phoebe moves the tiara to the attic, without saying where she took it. Rex is thwarted at last and the two cops finally give up and leave. Rex returns to his body, and tells Hannah they'll have to up the ante. The sisters can't figure out how the tiara got in the manor, though Phoebe suspects a warlock. Leo arrives, ostensibly to fix the bathroom sink. Instead, he heads to the attic and uses telekinesis; this is the first hint that he is not just a handyman. Piper walks in and Leo tells her that he might have to leave.

Phoebe goes to Rex's apartment and his astral form insists that she will see it as ""spectacular"".

The girls have to keep moving the tiara He offers her wine and tells her that ""Zeitgeist Magazine"" wants to interview her. He offers her sushi and walks out. He projects, and gives her a premonition of Prue at Buckland's, being pursued by a warlock. She walks out in a panic. Rex calls 911. Manipulating his voice to sound like Jaime's, he claims he is at Buckland's and someone is trying to kill him. Prue is working late at Buckland's. She sneaks into Hannah's office and uses her computer; she looks for Hannah's name on the database, and there's no record of it. She looks for Rex's name as well; there's no record of it either. Rex projects and tells her that a warlock is after her. He projects again and tells her that an innocent is in danger, and that she is to grab an artifact. Hannah cracks Jaime over the head with the artifact, killing him, and leaves the missing security tape on his body. Andy and Darryl find Prue over the dead security guard, with the murder weapon in her hand. The security tape shows Prue taking the tiara. The police arrest Prue for murder.

Rex dates Phoebe Piper and Phoebe go to Rex's apartment to seek his help, but find it empty except for Phoebe's lipstick. They realize that Rex is a warlock. Back at the manor, they try to figure out how to free Prue. They conclude that if Rex is a warlock, Hannah almost certainly is one as well.

Phoebe hides the tiara in an armoire, not knowing that Rex is projecting into the room. They go to the jail and Piper freezes the guards. Piper unlocks Prue's cell; the two flee, and join Phoebe outside. Rex, however, is waiting outside with a Polaroid camera and takes a picture. He says he has known all along they were witches, but saw he wasn't powerful enough to attack them directly so he opted for blackmail; he demands their powers in return for the picture, and also promises to clear Prue of the tiara theft as well. He hands them a lantern that will catch their powers when they cast the relevant spell.

Prue in jail Andy doesn't want to believe Prue is guilty of murder; the evidence tying her to the guard's death is piling up too neatly.

The sisters discuss Rex's demand, not knowing that Rex and Leo overhear them, and decide to give up their powers in hopes that they can somehow reverse it. The sisters say the Relinquishment Spell, each one in turn, and their powers go into the lantern. The Book of Shadows is now entirely blank.

Rex comes to and tells Hannah that the sisters are on their way. Hannah shapeshifts into a panther.

The sisters are stopped by Rex as they flee the jail Andy searches for the names Rex Buckland and Hannah Webster, and discovers that the real ones were murdered on the same day. The real Hannah was African American; the woman using her name is white. The real Rex was balding, short and stocky, unlike the follically-enhanced, strapping man using his name. He tells Darryl that he thinks the faux Rex and Hannah are framing Prue. The sisters go back to Buckland's. They hand over the lantern to Rex. Hannah, in her panther form, rushes out from the office. Unknown to the sisters, Leo walks into the attic and finds the Book of Shadows blank. He raises his hands over it and restores the spells to its pages, and with it the sisters' powers. As Hannah leaps, Piper throws out her hands in fright.

Leo orbs away from the manor Suddenly, both Hannah and Rex freeze. The sisters realize that their powers are restored and Prue moves Rex to where the sisters were. Hannah knocks Rex to the ground, mauls him and returns to human form. The two go up in flames. Hannah protests that Rex had failed, not her as they disappear into the flames, leaving only ash behind. The sisters return Prue to jail, where Andy and Darryl set her free. They tell her that they found the tiara in Rex' office, and also have evidence Rex and Hannah were skimming off auction proceeds. The sisters find the Book of Shadows restored. Leo comes in for his toolbox and says goodbye, saying he's fixed everything he was supposed to fix. The sisters tear out the relinquishment spell and burn the page.

Leo walks out the front door, and is seen orbing as he leaves."

One picks the urn up and a symbol on it glows. Clay, one of the thieves, takes possession of the urn and the three plan to meet in San Francisco. The Guardian of the Urn appears to another of the thieves, Wesley, and places a spider on his chest. The spider delivers a fatal bite as Clay and Palmer escape. Clay appears at the manor; he turns out to be an ex-boyfriend of Phoebe. The sisters are talking at Quake when a waiter, Doug, spills some glasses. Piper freezes him and saves the glasses. Doug's girlfriend, Shelley, also works at Quake. She has dumped him, he's a wreck and he's constantly dropping dishes.

Clay tells Phoebe about the urn and he wants Prue to sell it via Buckland's. Rex Buckland and Hannah Webster had skimmed off so much in auction proceeds that a bank forced Buckland's into bankruptcy and sent Claire Pryce to run it. Claire wants to move $1.2 million of merchandise the next day, or she will close Buckland's. Clay brings the urn in, but Prue suspects the urn might be stolen. Clay bumps into Palmer, who mentions the urn in front of Phoebe.

At the auction, Claire comes to Prue and tells her that the urn is stolen. Prue uses her power to switch the tags on the urn and a picture, and takes the urn away. She meets Palmer, who tells her of the curse on the urn. Prue uses telekinesis to move the urn, making Palmer believe that the curse is real, and he runs out.

Piper has cast a spell to boost Doug's confidence. She and Phoebe walk into Quake and find Doug shaking a cocktail and with a half dozen girls fawning over him. Shelley looks on, jealous.

The Guardian catches Palmer as he is about to skip town. She places a scorpion on his neck, which gives him a fatal sting. Prue tells Phoebe that the urn is stolen and cursed. Phoebe is reconnecting with Clay, though, and has a hard time believing Prue.

Buckland's has raised $1.28 million and Claire agrees to leave it open. Andy walks into Prue's office and tells her about Palmer. He had found Prue's business card on Palmer's body.

Phoebe confronts Clay about the urn and he admits that he stole it. He knows that Wesley and Palmer are dead, but had not known about the curse. Phoebe believes that Clay had brought the curse among the sisters. Later, Clay meets Phoebe at the manor and offers to take the urn and turn himself in to the police. Phoebe gets a vision and sees Clay confronting a giant cobra. At Buckland's, the Guardian appears to Clay, Phoebe and Prue. Clay flees, Prue's telekinesis barely affects the Guardian, and the two sisters also run.

The three sisters consult the Book of Shadows, and find nothing about the urn--but that a curse for greed can be reversed by a selfless act. They come back down and find Clay gone. Clay has returned to Buckland's and offers himself to the Guardian. The Guardian throws down a glowing cord, which turns into a huge cobra. The sisters run in and Clay blocks the cobra from Phoebe. This selfless act redeems him. The Guardian disappears, and then so does the urn.

Piper has reversed the confidence spell and Doug is back to dropping dishes. He spills a tray in front of Shelley. Piper freezes him and pulls an engagement ring out of his apron. Shelley finds the ring and Doug asks Shelley to marry him. She had given up on waiting for him to ask, but now they are reconciled. Clay walks in and asks if there is any chance Phoebe will return with him to New York. She tells him San Francisco is her home now"

Piper decides to call the auto club instead, but her cell phone quits. She spots a telephone booth. While walking to the telephone booth, she hears someone in the woods. She runs for the booth and shuts herself inside. A hairy beast attacks and breaks in. A man appears and fires a flare gun at the beast, which then flees. Piper is scratched on her left arm. Phoebe talks Prue into hiring her at Buckland's.

Piper reveals her wounds to her sisters and Andy Piper is in the hospital being bandaged. The man with the flare gun identifies himself as Billy Waters. Andy introduces FBI agent Ashley Fallon, who tells him about the creature. Billy tells the sisters about the creature; it had killed his fiancee, Laura, by ripping her heart out. Andy wonders why Billy had a flare gun; Billy mentions that it appears to be afraid of fire. Piper consults the Book of Shadows and finds out it is called a Wendigo. Phoebe and Prue find a gold charm bracelet among goods to be auctioned. Phoebe picks up the bracelet and has a vision of a car accident. The bracelet bears the initials TL.

Piper tells Billy of the first known Wendigo. The first Wendigo had been betrayed by his lover, and cut her heart out. Piper stands up, has a dizzy spell, and begins to feel tired.

Andy has found more information on the Wendigo. It kills before, on or after a full moon; and chooses only AB-negative blood type victims. He thinks the creature is merely a serial killer.

Phoebe produces some handcuffs to secure Wendigo Piper with Billy goes to Fallon and they talk in a parking garage. He tells her what Piper told him. He lights a cigarette and Fallon freaks. Billy recoils, realizing that Fallon might well be the Wendigo. Fallon snaps his neck, killing him.

Phoebe has tracks down the car from the accident and finds the owner of the bracelet, Teri Lane. Phoebe is unwilling to let the bracelet be sold.

A health inspector, Laurence Beck, appears at Quake. Piper is evidently ill and sweating. The inspector orders Piper to go home or he will close Quake.

The bracelet comes up for auction. Several bidders raise their paddles, but Prue uses her power to fling them away. The bracelet goes unsold.

Piper dreams of meeting Andy at the manor, turning into a Wendigo, and attacking him. She awakens and finds Andy at the door. She states she feels ill and tries to wave him off. He tells her what happened to Billy, and Fallon also appears at the manor. Fallon suggests that Piper might have been infected from the attack on her. Piper pulls the bandage off her arm and finds that her arm has become hairy.

Phoebe visits Harriet Lane and presents the bracelet. Harriet does not recognize the bracelet. Phoebe asks Harriet what her daughter's name is. Prue is in the hall with Teri, and mother and daughter have a tearful reunion.

Andy and Fallon meet in a park near where Piper was attacked. She flirts with him, and tells him of her fiance who had walked out on her, saying she took steps to make sure she could never be hurt like that again. Andy blows her off, saying that they're only partners on the case.

Piper transforming into the Wendigo Prue and Phoebe return to the manor and find Piper sweating, frightened and occasionally snapping at them. Phoebe picks up Fallon's business card and has a vision: Fallon is the Wendigo. The sisters consult the Book of Shadows. They find nothing direct, but determine that they must kill Fallon to save Piper. They need to restrain Piper, however. Phoebe produces a pair of handcuffs, to a bit of embarrassment, and she and Prue cuff Piper to a pipe. Prue and Phoebe go to an Army surplus store to get a flare gun. Night falls, and Piper transforms into a Wendigo with the transformation ripping off her clothes. She pulls free of the pipe and the handcuffs. Fallon also transforms and attacks Andy. She scratches his chest, but just as she's about to cut his heart out, Prue and Phoebe arrive. Prue fires the flare gun. She misses twice. They find Andy, and Prue misses again. Piper arrives, and Prue and Phoebe don't know which Wendigo to shoot. Phoebe shoots this time, aiming at the Wendigo on the left. Suddenly, the flare freezes in flight--and so does the Wendigo on the right, proving that she's Fallon. Prue then moves the flare toward Fallon, killing her. Piper is restored to normal leaving her naked and freezing. Andy's chest wound then heals as Prue checks up on him.

Phoebe quits her job, because working around so much old stuff at Buckland's will give her premonitions everywhere and she can't handle it, and she needs to find a world of her own."

Phoebe has an upcoming job interview and wants a good luck charm. Tanjella, the proprietor, is anxious to close before midnight. The next day is Friday the 13th and Tanjella tells skeptical Prue and Phoebe of a convergence of negative energy. At midnight, the clock strikes 13 and the sisters leave. A massive cloud of smoke covers the area around the store. The demon Barbas appears out of the cloud as they drive away and slides through the closed door. Barbas gestures and names Tanjella's greatest fear: being buried in an earthquake. The shop shakes, and things fall down everywhere. Tanjella tries to move, but can't; Barbas tells her she's paralyzed by her fear. Tanjella falls down dead, her hair turned entirely white. Phoebe talks to Piper and notes that Prue never says ""I love you."" Piper is planning a superstition-themed fund raiser at Quake. Piper is adhering to lots of superstitions, but Prue is typically skeptical.

Andy shows up and asks after Prue as Phoebe and Piper leave the manor. He notes the death of Tanjella and two others who died like her. Prue had been Tanjella's last customer. The three victims were all single young women involved with the occult. After he leaves, Prue consults the Book of Shadows and finds the page on the Demon of Fear. The page is in her mother's handwriting. Prue meets Piper at Quake and tells what she found: Barbas must kill 13 single female witches to free himself, and can only do this on one Friday the 13th every 1300 years. He kills by exploiting a witch's greatest fear. Prue remembers Piper is wary of flying, and that Phoebe is afraid of being stuck in an elevator. Piper tells Prue to stay away from pools; ever since their mother drowned she's been afraid of drowning as well.

Phoebe interviews at SWA Properties, a real estate firm, and easily lands the job. Her boss, however, wants her to cover if her husband calls. The boss leaves with her lover.

Barbas visits a witch named Zoe. However, Zoe has been expecting Barbas, and claims to have no fear. However, she still fears fire; she merely suppressed it over the years. Barbas causes flame to shoot out of one of Zoe's candles and turn into a ring of fire. Prue had found her name on a flyer that Tanjella had given her and enters Zoe's apartment, but she is a moment too late. Fearing that she might be suspected of involvement in the murders, Prue calls 911 and heads for home. Andy notes that Zoe is the fifth woman to die this way, implying one other besides Tanjella. Darryl has found Prue's name on the doorman's log.

The sisters are dining at Quake and Prue is trying to discourage Piper from relying on superstition. Phoebe finds a ladybug on a leaf and notes something Grams once told her: that a ladybug can lead you to your ideal mate. The ladybug lands on a young man on a nearby table, Lucas. After Prue and Phoebe leave, Lucas comes over and asks Piper out.

Phoebe is conflicted about lying to her boss's husband. She flips the good luck charm, but it lands standing on its side. She has a vision of Prue drowning in the shower. She calls the manor, but Prue doesn't answer. Prue is in the shower and sees Barbas as he appears. The shower begins to fill with water. Her powers don't work because of her fear. At last her head is underwater. Andy and Darryl appear at the manor to ask Prue about Zoe. They hear her scream and kick the door in. They enter the bathroom, but Barbas disappears. The water recedes and Prue is saved. Prue is reticent and tells the cops that she had soap in her eyes. Andy thinks that Prue might have been the next victim. Phoebe reaches the manor and the cops leave. Phoebe notices that a lock of Prue's hair has turned white indicating just how close Barbas came to killing her.

Prue and Phoebe consult the Book of Shadows. Prue notices the attic smells of sandalwood, a scent that their mother had worn, and finds a new line on Barbas's page: ""To let go of your fear, trust in the greatest of all powers"". Prue says this line wasn't present before, and that she feels their mother's presence. Phoebe says ""I love you"" and Prue only says ""me too."" It turns out ""I love you"" was the last thing Prue said to her mother before she died.

Patty appears to help Prue Piper is having a run of bad luck. In the kitchen at Quake, she tries to cast a spell, but the burning sage stick only sets off a smoke alarm. She ends up scalding her hand when she attempts to neutralize the sage stick.

The husband of Phoebe's boss appears at her desk. He asks where his wife is and Phoebe is unwilling to lie. She says nothing definite and instead tries to quit her job. The husband knew about the affair but had been in denial. As he leaves, a client calls, wanting to bring Phoebe out to a large estate. Phoebe goes, only to find that the ""client"" is, in fact, Barbas. There is a pool on the grounds. Phoebe's greatest fear is losing a sister, not elevators as she thinks. Barbas ties Phoebe up. Barbas calls Prue using Phoebe's voice.

Piper has dinner with Lucas. After a while, she thinks Lucas is too good to be true. He mentions pictures of his nieces, and she freezes him. She checks out his wallet and finds that he is telling the truth, but feels wrong about choosing him based on superstitions. She unfreezes him and claims to be superstitious, immediately turning him off.

Patty writes to Prue in the Book of Shadows Prue reaches the estate. Barbas shoves her into the pool. Prue, however, sees the ghost of her mother in the pool. Patty tells her that the ""greatest power"" named in the Book is love. Patty takes Prue's hand and she returns to the surface. Her power restored, she flings Barbas back. She declares that she is not afraid and Barbas vanishes in a cloud of red embers. Prue can once again say ""I love you."" As midnight chimes, Prue is reading Barbas's page in the Book of Shadows. New writing appears: ""Thanks for letting them into your heart."""

The thugs take Max away at gunpoint, and tell Gordan not to tell anyone if he wants Max back safe the next day. In the attic, the sisters are doing spring cleaning, and Prue helps move things along telekinetically. Prue mentions that Phoebe, inadvertently, told her about a planned surprise party. Piper and Phoebe want to keep their toys to give to their kids, but Prue wants hers thrown away; she doesn't think she's cut out to be a mother.

The thugs have Max tied up and gagged in an auto shop and tell him to do as he's told if he wants to live. One of them mentions that his brother told him Max helped them break into an arcade.

Prue cleans the Attic The Spirit Board starts moving, and Prue records its message: ""Help Max"". The sisters don't know what to make of it.

Piper argues on the phone with Harry, a new chef at Quake. Harry has replaced all of her knives. As she leaves, she bumps into Leo. She's happy to see him and tells him of a flickering chandelier.

Prue goes to Andy and tells him of Max. He wants to know how she knows and all she can think of is to tell him of the spirit board. Andy has no record of any missing persons named Max.

Phoebe finds Leo hovering to fix a chandelier Piper arrives at Quake and argues with Harry. He has disrespected her, changed all the menus, and is wearing shorts instead of the proper chef's uniform. Piper tries to fire him, but Harry curtly says she can't. She freezes him and throws his crab ravioli into the trash. The thugs force Max to disable the security system at a microchip plant. Max concentrates and a panel shorts out. One of the thugs enters the front door and walks out -- they are not out to steal anything, only to test Max. As the thug leaves, a security guard confronts him. The thug pulls a gun and fires, wounding the guard.

Phoebe surprises Leo, while he is levitating to fix the chandelier. Leo explains that he is a Whitelighter, a guardian angel for good witches. He he was sent out by the Elders to watch over the Charmed Ones when they first got their powers. He demonstrates his powers by warming Phoebe's tea. Leo admits that he came back to help Max, who is a young witch new to the Craft. He got word that someone was trying to make Max use his powers for evil purposes, and that he manipulated the Spirit Board so Prue would get Max's cry for help. Leo asks Phoebe to keep his secret. He tells Phoebe that he fell in love with Piper, and that witches and Whitelighters aren't allowed to fall in love.

Andy visits Prue at her office. She hides the spirit board in her drawer. He's found out about Max, who was seen at the break-in at the microchip plant. He also said that he went to see his father, and it was obvious he knew what was going on, but was afraid to tell. Meanwhile, the spirit board starts moving and Prue records it's message ""Kidnapped auto shop"". Prue calls Piper and lets her know what's going on, but Harry breaks in.

Leo agonizes over how to break it off with Piper.

Prue goes to see Gordan. He refuses to talk to her, until she reveals that she is a witch. Gordan tells her that his wife, Paulette, was also a witch, but that she didn't reveal that both she and Max were witches, until shortly before her death three months ago. Not long after that, Max started manifesting his powers, and Gordan couldn't handle it. Prue mentions the auto shop clue, and Gordan mentions Max's friend Danny. As it turns out, Danny's brother; David, one of the thugs, works there.

Prue gets some information from Danny, and heads to the auto shop with Gordan. She finds Max and unties him, but one of the thugs shows up just as she's about to head out. Prue throws him out the door. The other thug shows up, and Prue throws him as well. Just as they're about to leave, one of the thugs comes to and knocks her out. Prue comes to, and Max has been wired with plastic explosives. One of the thugs has a remote control, and threatens to blow Max up if Prue tries anything funny.

Max is ashamed of his powers, but Prue tells him they're a gift. Max tells Prue that his dad hates him for these new powers, but Prue tells him he's just as new to them as he is. She promises to protect him.

Leo tries to break up with Piper, but can't find the right words. Phoebe shows up at the wrong moment as Harry yells at Piper again.

Darryl shows Andy a picture of Mickey Jackson, one of the thugs. Mickey had robbed a bank and the two think he's planning another bank robbery. They don't know where Max fits in. Phoebe calls, asking after Prue, and Andy asks after Max. Phoebe makes an excuse and hangs up. Leo is unable to sense either Prue or Max. Piper walks into the manor, Phoebe leaves, and now Piper is alone with Leo. Leo tries again to break up with Piper; she freezes him and confronts Phoebe. Phoebe offers no answers. Leo says that he is ""involved"" and he has to leave again. Piper admits that Leo is ""geographically undesirable"", kisses him and walks out. Leo gets a ""jingle"" and suddenly walks out the door.

The thugs load up a van with guns. Prue discusses witchcraft with Max. Prue says she feels his pain; her mother died when she was about Max's age. She also says that she didn't expect to come into her powers either, but had to figure it out for herself and thinks Max can too, with his father's help. Prue attempts to rescue Max, but gets caught in the process. Prue talks to Max about his power of psychokinesis. The thugs order Max and Prue into the van. Gordan appears and begs the thugs to let Max go. The thugs shove Max and Prue into the van, and Mickey shoots the father. It's night now and the thugs order Max to disable an alarm system of a bank and open a vault. The four enter the bank and the thugs start stealing money. Prue encourages Max to use his power, giving a knowing glance at the bomb. He defuses the bomb strapped to him and activates the alarm. The guards show up, but Prue sees the thugs readying machine guns, and throws the guards out of the way, just before the thugs open fire. Mickey angrily hits the button, and is surprised when nothing happens. Prue yanks the guns out of the thugs' hands. Before they can figure out what is happening, she throws the thugs into the vault and locks them in.

Gordan is near death, when a white light appears. He thinks it's Paulette, but it's really Leo. He heals Gordan's gunshot wound, encourages him to continue to raise Max well, and orbs away. Prue and Max return in the van and find Gordan unharmed. Gordan invites Prue to visit Paulette's grave with him.

Leo has left and Piper thinks he has a secret. Phoebe tells her and Prue that Leo is a Whitelighter and that he wasn't supposed to fall in love with Piper. Neither Piper nor Prue believes her."

Without warning, the mysterious man draws a sword and kills Luther, saying he is after his killer instinct. Prue and Piper come home from shopping. Piper is dreading having to do yearly inventory at Quake. Prue is surprised to discover an old marble statue of Grams in the living room. They'd planned to put it in storage, but Piper found out that the storage facility they wanted had unexpectedly jacked up their prices. She and Phoebe voted to keep it at the manor--unless Prue can move it. Prue tries to pick it up, but it's too heavy--it's solid marble. She does, however, remind Piper that eventually she'll be powerful enough to move it to the basement.

Phoebe is sparring with a dummy in the sunroom. She has been taking self-defense classes to hone her fighting skills as she wants to make up for only having a passive power. Phoebe manages to grab Prue by the arm. She has a vision of Prue dying at the hand of a man with a sword. The next morning, Phoebe draws the sword she saw, but cannot find it in the Book of Shadows. Prue comes downstairs, about to head to work -- she's due to meet a major client at Buckland's. Piper and Phoebe don't want Prue to leave the house, but this is the first time Prue has dealt with a major client in some time, and she doesn't want to lose Claire's trust in her. Piper and Phoebe finally get Prue to promise to come straight home after work. Helena Statler meets with Prue and Claire at Buckland's. She says that she and her brother have amassed a large collection of antiquities, and are thinking about having Buckland's sell them. Prue is apprehensive when Helena says the collection is located in the Warehouse Flats, but with Claire glowering over her she agrees to go.

Phoebe at last finds the sword; it belongs to the Lords of War. The sword renders its bearer invulnerable to the weapons of man and steals power. Phoebe and Piper read in the Book of Shadows that when a Lord of War is disgraced, he must steal his powers back-- including the power of a firstborn witch, since they are always the most powerful. They fear that one of them might be after Prue.

Prue meets Helena at the Warehouse Flats with her collection. One of the items is a pillory; Prue puts her arms in it, and it suddenly closes. The mysterious man seen at the beginning of the show appears, and Helena introduces him as her brother, Gabriel-- a Lord of War. The Statlers know that Prue is a witch, and trapped her arms because they suspected she channeled her power through them, as did one of her ancestors, Brianna Warren. However, Prue opens the pillory with her power, much to the Statlers' surprise; they didn't know she channeled her power through her eyes. She throws Helena against a wall, then swings a halberd at Gabriel. The halberd doesn't even scratch him, and Prue makes a break for the door. Gabriel throws his sword at her and misses, allowing Prue to make good her escape.

Phoebe finds Gabriel in the Book of Shadows. Brianna Warren had taken Gabriel's sword during the Crimean War, disgracing him, and now he must steal his powers back. Trying to find a solution, Phoebe finds an incantation to triple a witch's strength. Piper doesn't like this idea, but Prue doesn't want to chance Gabriel getting to them before they can get to him. Prue chants the spell in the attic, and it summons two more Prues. The next morning, Phoebe provides the Prues with sweaters in order to tell them apart: one pink, one blue, and one black for the real Prue. Pink-Prue says that the clones are only there as long as they're needed-- presumably until they find a way to defeat Gabriel. Real-Prue had her assistant at Buckland's track down the ownership records for one of the Statlers' pieces, in hopes of finding their address. Piper isn't sure that the three Prues will have enough power to fight Gabriel, but they reassure her by easily lifting the statue. Andy comes to the manor, claiming a social call. Pink-Prue answers and he gives her tickets to the Bay Area Musical Awards. Claire calls and wants Prue at Buckland's immediately if she wants to keep her job. Piper doesn't think the five of them should split up, but the Prues think two of them can go to Buckland's while one of them goes to Quake with Piper. They take a vote; Piper and Phoebe don't want to split up, but are outvoted by the Prues. Real-Prue and pink-Prue go to Buckland's. Pink-Prue gets Gabriel's address. Claire confronts pink-Prue about the incident at the warehouse. Claire takes the sheet with Gabriel's address. Real-Prue calls the manor to talk to Phoebe, but has to hang up when pink-Prue tries to butt in. Claire arrives, and real-Prue leaves with her.

Pink-Prue calls Piper at Quake to touch base. Piper goes into the kitchen to find blue-Prue sampling spaghetti and flirting with the cooks. Piper is mystified at blue-Prue's behavior, but blue-Prue says she's a side of Prue that doesn't come out very often.

Pink-Prue runs into Gabriel. Gabriel throws a flash canister. Pink-Prue is temporarily blinded, but uses her power to nick Gabriel in the face with his own sword. Enraged, Gabriel runs pink-Prue through with the sword. He expects Prue's power to flow into him via his sword, and is surprised when nothing happens. He realizes that he's been tricked. Real-Prue feels the pain.

Andy finds pink-Prue in the morgue and goes to Phoebe. Phoebe asks what color sweater was ""Prue"" wearing; it was pink. Blue-Prue walks in, followed by real-Prue, and Piper freezes the room while real-Prue hides. Andy doesn't know what to think. Blue-Prue doesn't know about the concert.

Piper, Phoebe and the two remaining Prues plan to confront Gabriel at his house. Helena and Gabriel, meanwhile, plan to face the Halliwells at the manor. The three sisters make further plans, excluding blue-Prue from of the conversation. Piper and Phoebe eventually talk real-Prue out of attacking the Statlers at their house. They come out to discover blue-Prue has headed for the Statlers' house.

Phoebe kicks The Lord Of War Blue-Prue takes Helena hostage in a torture device and demands the sword in exchange for Helena's life. However, Gabriel realizes this Prue is a clone as well, and instead kills Helena, then comes after clone Prue. Real Prue and Phoebe are heading for Gabriel's house when real-Prue feels Gabriel killing the clone.

The sisters hatch a new plan--get the sword away from Gabriel and kill him with it. Phoebe has a vision and knows that Gabriel is coming.

Andy asks the medical examiner about pink clone Prue. The ME says that as far as he can tell, the woman is Prue Halliwell.

Gabriel breaks through a window of the darkened manor. He throws his sword, but it strikes only Phoebe's sparring dummy. He is now vulnerable, and the sisters attack. Piper freezes him, and Phoebe kicks him, knocking him against a wall. Prue flings his sword into his chest, vanquishing him.

Andy takes Prue to the morgue to show her the clone, but finds only the clothes that pink clone Prue was wearing. Later he opens a folder marked HALLIWELL, PRUE and removes a sheet mentioning black magic and witchcraft"

He comes from generations of warlocks and wants to change, but feels weak. The priest tries to reassure him. His brothers, warlocks named Greg and Paul, confront him in the church; they want him to join them. Piper, Prue and Phoebe are unloading food from a Quake van for a benefit the church is holding. Phoebe grabs a pen that Brendan had, and has a vision of him being attacked by warlocks in the church. The sisters split up to find him.

Greg and Paul tell Brendan that he must join them to fulfill the destiny of the Rowe Coven. Brendan refuses. Greg morphs into a demonic form and knocks Brendan across the room. Greg grabs Brendan and tells him he can't run away from his destiny. Just then, Prue arrives and flings Greg into a table. Greg gets up and runs out, with Paul close behind. She offers to help Brendan, but he flees.

In a loft Greg and Paul share, Paul is admiring his pet chameleon, but Greg is obsessed with turning Brendan evil. Greg is fed up with the chameleon and is about to flip the cage over. Paul raises his hand and a force field surrounds the cage. Greg calms down, and Paul drops the force field. Paul wants to let Brendan go, but Greg insists on turning him and is even willing to kill him if he won't turn. Brendan is to be ordained as a priest within two days; once this is done, he will never be a warlock.

Josh calls the manor. Piper tries to stall, but Phoebe won't go along. Josh wants to take Piper out on Friday night, but Piper awkwardly declines. They then talk about Brendan. Prue wants to try to find him; she sensed that he wouldn't be scared about her being a witch.

Prue talks to Father Austin and warns him of Greg and Paul. Father Austin had expected them to come sooner or later, but is reticent with further details. He does, however, tell Prue where he can find Brendan.

Phoebe plays matchmaker between Piper and Josh. Piper finally agrees to go out with him, and Phoebe agrees to cover for her at Quake.

Prue finds Brendan at a ranch, and overhears him telling a girl he can't kill a spider he found on her. She asks who attacked him, and he initially isn't willing to talk about it. She goes horseback riding with him, and gets him to open up more; now he says it doesn't matter, as tomorrow he will be a priest and safe from them.

Piper goes rock climbing with Josh. She takes a fall, and Josh catches her. They exchange ""the look"" and Piper starts to panic. She freezes the scene and calls Phoebe. The sink is overflowing in the Quake kitchen and when Piper realizes the emergency, she unfreezes the scene, makes an excuse to Josh about the phone and leaves for Quake.

At the church, Brendan is standing over a badly injured Father Austin. He shows a demonic face. Prue walks in and he resumes his human face and flees. Prue catches up with him and flings him to the ground. Brendan insists that his brothers hurt Father Austin, and it was rage over what happened that turned him into a warlock. Unlike earlier, he begs for Prue's help. Prue is skeptical; there's no such thing as a good warlock. Father Austin is rushed to the hospital and a nun identifies Brendan to Andy and Darryl. Andy takes it very personally; Father Austin has been his priest since he was a boy.

Back at Quake, Piper tells Phoebe she should have called her. She also admits she's afraid that Josh will turn out to be either a ghost, a warlock or will live too far away for their relationship to work but thanks Phoebe for trying to set her up with someone.

Brendan tells Prue that he comes from a long line of powerful warlocks. However, he is only half warlock; his mother is human. His brothers want him to join them so they can create the most powerful evil force that the world has ever known, an evil counterpart to the Charmed Ones. However, he wants no part of it, and has been fighting his evil side all of his life. He has been on the run for many years to keep Greg and Paul from finding him. He wants to become a priest not only to completely suppress his warlock side, but to make up for all the evil his family has done over the centuries. He tells Prue that he is going to end it by killing Greg and Paul but that she and her sisters may have to kill him as well.

That night, Brendan confronts his brothers. Greg seems to be overjoyed that Brendan is willing to kill him and Paul. Brendan shoves Greg into another room. Suddenly, Greg gestures, lighting several candles and revealing a young woman spread on an altar. Greg and Paul urge Brendan to stab her, but the sisters arrive and free her. Before they can go after Greg and Paul, Paul repels them with a stream of electricity. Paul yells to Greg that they need Brendan on their side to defeat the sisters. Greg and Paul escape, while the sisters take Brendan home with them. Andy talks to the young woman and she gives the names of Brendan and Prue.

Prue shelters Brendan at the manor. He admits that he almost gave in to evil and is again unsure of himself. Prue believes in him, saying that she knows his good side is stronger. Her sisters, however, aren't as sure. However, Prue reminds them that both of them had encounters with evil and successfully fought them off (Piper with the Wendigo and Phoebe with the Woogyman). Andy shows up and demands to know where Brendan is. The sisters give no answers. Andy tells them that Father Austin is in critical condition. If Father Austin dies, Andy warns, he won't be able to look the other way if Prue is involved.

In Brendan's cell at the rectory, Greg and Paul chant, giving Brendan disturbed sleep and stirring up his warlock side. He joins them in the chant, then gets up and smashes a spider in a web. The next morning, Brendan returns to his cell and offers to join his brothers. Paul says that he needs merely to kill a mortal in order to be fully initiated as a warlock. However, Greg thinks that isn't enough, and demands that Brendan prove himself by sacrificing Prue and taking her powers.

The next morning, Prue and Piper find Brendan missing. Phoebe joins them and tells them that Rowe warlocks have been around since the tenth century, and no one has been able to figure out how to vanquish them. She also says that what she's read in the Book of Shadows, they won't have stand a chance if Greg and Paul have managed to turn Brendan. Prue meets Brendan at the rectory, and he pulls a knife out of the door. He says that his brothers cast a spell on him to make him see her as just another mortal. Just as Brendan goes after Prue, she flings him into a closet, and he assumes his demon face. Piper and Phoebe join them and Prue talks Brendan out of giving in to evil. He resumes his human face, and doesn't appear to remember anything.

Brendan and the sisters head downstairs, with Brendan in his vestments. Greg and Paul are waiting for them. Piper tries to freeze Paul, but he raises a force field around him. Phoebe throws Brendan's knife at Greg, but he raises a force field around him as well. Prue tries to fling them into the wall, but they still have their force fields up. Greg grabs the knife and is ready to throw it at Brendan, but Paul talks him into offering Brendan one more chance to turn. Brendan refuses. Enraged that Brendan has chosen good over evil, Greg throws the knife, but Paul jumps in front of it, proving his affection for his younger brother. Mortally wounded, Paul uses his last ounce of strength to throw the knife back at Greg, killing him as well. Brendan proceeds to his ordination.

Father Austin has identified Greg and Paul as his attackers; Brendan and Prue are off the hook. The sisters are together at Quake when Josh appears; it was Piper who called him and they seek another table."

The children are playing with a ball, when David throws it towards the woods. A demon comes out and grabs David. Prue tries to separate them by telekinesis, and an attack-dog reporter, Eric Lohman, witnesses this act. The demon opens a hole in the ground and disappears with David. The sisters learn of an abduction the prior day, and two more twenty years earlier, from the same spot. The demon shoots lightning upon David's eyes and he can no longer see.

Phoebe learns the name one of the kidnapping victims from twenty years ago, Brent Miller.

Eric Lohman appears at Prue's office. He claims to have seen her use magic and wants a story. Prue refuses to talk to him. He threatens to make her look bad in his story if she doesn't cooperate.

Phoebe tracks down Brent Miller. He is a successful software developer. He is unwilling to talk about his kidnapping, until Phoebe tells him about the recent ones. She believes his story about ""monsters"" abducting him. He mentions that the monsters said something about auras.

The demons peek out from the storm drain and see a glowing aura around a man. One gestures, and the man is strangled to death.

Piper and Phoebe consult the Book of Shadows about auras and identify the demons as grimlocks. The man is identified as Jerry Cartwright, a wealthy philanthropist.

Eric Lohman goes to Andy and asks after Prue. Lohman claims that Prue has powers and keeps popping up in unsolved murder cases. Andy refuses to comment.

Josh shows Piper a map of the storm drain system. Josh tells Piper that he has a new job in Beverly Hills, but he'll stay in San Francisco if Piper wants. Piper freezes him and rants out loud, deciding she needs more time to decide.

Brent recounts his kidnapping to Phoebe. Phoebe takes his hand and has a vision. Phoebe asks of anything he might have heard that could locate the grimlocks. Brent has a map of the public works; it has raised lines so he can feel it. Between his memories and Phoebe's vision, they are able to locate where he was held. Andy appears at Prue's office and wants to talk about the kidnapping, and what Lohman had told him of Prue's powers. He believes Prue is keeping a secret, but Prue is unsure of whether to reveal it.

Phoebe locates an entrance to the storm drain and goes to the manor. Piper meets Prue at the manor and a baby carriage rolls into the street. Piper freezes the scene. The neighbor doesn't have a baby, though, and there are only towels in the carriage.

The two sisters find Lohman there and return to their former location before unfreezing. Piper's purse is on the opposite shoulder, and Lohman got this on tape. Phoebe comes in, followed by Lohman. He confronts them about the tape and Prue throws him out.

Phoebe and Piper gather maps and go to the storm drain instance, while Prue distracts Lohman. When Phoebe and Piper drive off, Lohman tries to follow, but Prue flings a screwdriver into his tire. Andy goes to Brent and he tells her about Phoebe; Andy follows Piper and Phoebe to the storm drain. Piper falls into a deep hole, alerting the grimlocks. Phoebe calls Prue, who is mixing potions. She comes out and finds that Lohman has disabled her car. She, at last, agrees to talk and the two go to the storm drain.

Lohman follows Prue into the storm drain. A grimlock finds Piper and starts to strangle her; Prue flings a metal bar into it's head. A grimlock kills Lohman. Prue uses her power to get Piper out of the hole, but she is injured and the others lead her up toward the street. Andy arrives and shoots a grimlock, but the bullets do no harm. Prue flings it off of him and now Andy knows that Prue has powers. The sisters hand Piper off to Andy, who returns to the street. Phoebe's aura A grimlock confronts Phoebe and Prue. Prue throws a potion, melting it. Phoebe finds the children. The other grimlock appears and Prue drops her remaining potion. The grimlock tries to strangle Prue. Phoebe hits it in the head. It turns on Phoebe and now Prue flings the potion off the ground onto the grimlock, killing it. The boys' vision is restored, and so is Brent's.

In Alcatraz, the Soul Collector meets the ghost of Jackson Ward and promises revenge. She is after the souls of witches. A tour group enters and a guide enters Jackson's cell. The guard collapses and Jackson enters his body, his ride off the island. Claire threatens to fire Prue if she continues to have so many emergencies. Right after this, Phoebe calls and tells what she's found out about the ""Ghost of Alcatraz"". Some ghosts, according to Phoebe, need a dead body to transport them across water and Phoebe fears that Jackson might be at large on the mainland.

Darryl and Andy receive evidence about a murder; he is stabbed thirteen times in a circular pattern. A fingerprint on the weapon matches Jackson Ward, but he was executed 36 years earlier. Andy goes to the Charmed Ones and Phoebe tells him of the ghost. The murder victim was the son of the D.A. who had prosecuted Jackson Ward.

Jackson appears in the office of Judge Renault, who had presided over his trial. He picks up objects of the judge's desk, spooking him. Jackson chokes and then stabs the judge.

Prue shows up late for a meeting with some Japanese investors. Andy pulls her aside and tells of the latest murder. Prue wants to keep her job and so goes back to the investors. Afterwards, she and Andy go to the Book of Shadows. Phoebe has found a spell, but only a ghost can say it.

Jackson stabs at Andy, distracting him, and Prue is able to finish the spell. Andy finishes reviving Prue. Claire is firing Prue, when Andy walks in and covers for her. Claire changes her mind about firing Prue. Andy decides that life with a witch is not for him.

At the end of the episode, Prue burns all the files that Andy had collected about them and Piper flies home early, as she worries that something is up with her sisters, but they deny it together."

Leo appears behind her. Daisy is relieved to see him; she thought he was Alec, a Darklighter who has been chasing her for some time. Leo heals her hand, much to Daisy's amazement. Leo tells Daisy that he brought her to San Francisco, because he has ""powerful friends"" who can help protect her. He also tells her that he's made her invisible to Alec. At that moment, Alec appears. Daisy flees. Alec conjures a crossbow and shoots Leo in the shoulder. Leo orbs to the manor. Prue and Phoebe are planning a vacation in Cabo San Lucas. Piper calls from the attic; she has found Leo with an arrow in his shoulder. Leo admits that he is really their Whitelighter. Leo warns Phoebe and Piper that the arrow is poison-tipped. Prue returns to the attic with several bandages, and uses her power to remove the arrow. Leo tells the sisters about Alec and Daisy. He was protecting Daisy, because she has been identified as a future Whitelighter. Alec was originally after Daisy to seduce her and produce Darklighter spawn. However,

they fell in love, until she found out what he was. Alec, like most Darklighters, has the touch of death. Andy and Darryl are together at their desk, when Prue calls Andy. Andy can't talk now, as Darryl knows he's hiding something, so Prue offers to meet at Quake. Andy tells Prue to be careful, as Internal Affairs is after him. Prue tells Andy about Daisy; he offers to review security cameras to find her. Leo is bandaged up, but the arrow's poison is slowly killing him, and he can't use his healing power on himself. With his powers fading, he is losing his ability to cloak Daisy.

Alec orbs into Daisy's hotel room and won't leave her alone. The motel manager knocks, and then unlocks the door. Alec kills the manager as Daisy flees through the fire escape. Andy and Prue arrive, and Prue flings Alec across the room. Alec orbs out but, unlike Leo, his orbs are black.

Piper has found a power-switching spell in the Book of Shadows, and thinks she can use it to switch her powers with Leo, so she can heal him. With Prue and Phoebe all present, Piper casts the spell. Kit walks in and Piper tries to freeze her, but can't. Suddenly, Prue touches Phoebe and has a premonition of Kit apparently knocking over a lamp. Kit walks up to the lamp and Phoebe tries to shoo her away, and in the process, flings the lamp into the wall, shattering it. Piper must have Leo's healing power, but she doesn't know how to use it. Prue tells Piper that she has to figure out how to trigger Leo's power, just like they had to find their triggers when their own powers were unbound.

Andy calls and says that Daisy has bought a bus ticket.

Inspectors Rodriguez and Anderson grill Andy about the scene in the hotel. Rather than answer, Andy turns in his badge and his gun.

Daisy reaches the bus station and finds Alec everywhere she turns. Prue and Phoebe walk in. Prue tries to goad Phoebe into getting angry; she knows that her telekinesis was originally triggered by anger. Finally, Prue remembers that during high school, several guys called Phoebe ""Freebie"", after they caught her making out under the bleachers; the insult causes Phoebe to knock some magazines off a rack. Prue has a vision of Daisy cowering in the ladies' room. Prue and Phoebe confront Alec in the ladies' room. Alec conjures his crossbow. Phoebe tries to fling it out of his hand, but only causes all of the taps to come on and all of the soap to squirt out of the dispensers. Prue admits that she hit Grams' car several years ago an accident for which Phoebe took the heat. Phoebe flings Alec into a stall. Alec drops the crossbow. Prue picks it up, takes aim and shoots, but Alec black-orbs away. The two sisters bring Daisy to the manor.

Andy has sent flowers to Prue and the card says he needs to see her. Prue leaves to meet with Andy, while Daisy and Phoebe go to the attic. They find Leo almost dead and Piper crying. Daisy tries to leave, but Piper convinces her to stay.

Phoebe tries using telekinesis on Alec but she hits the chandelier instead Andy tells Prue that he has turned in his badge and is suspended. He warns her to be careful, and that it's best that they not be seen together, lest Rodriguez find out that Prue is his source. Andy adds that Prue and her sisters are doing the very thing that made him want to become a cop. Piper, upset, cries over Leo's body. She has tried to heal him several times, but can't figure out his trigger. She collapses on his body and tells him that she loves him.

Suddenly, her hands start to glow, and Leo is healed. He tells her that love triggers his healing power, but she had to find that out for herself. They come downstairs and prepare to call Prue, when Alec black-orbs in. Phoebe tries to blow him out the door, but knocks the chandelier down instead. Alec grabs Piper and offers to spare her life, if the sisters let him have Daisy. Prue comes in behind him. Alec tosses Piper aside, grabs Daisy and black-orbs out. Leo feels too weak to use his powers, so the four leave their powers switched. Leo coaches Piper on how to sense a charge. Piper finds Daisy and Phoebe and Prue go after her while Piper stays with Leo. They find Daisy and Alec in a cemetery, where Alec is about to sacrifice Daisy. Phoebe flings Alec aside. Prue casts the power-switching spell, just as Alec is about to use his touch of death on Daisy. Suddenly, Prue's hand starts glowing red-hot; she has Alec's touch of death and realizes hate is the trigger for it. Phoebe draws Alec towardsPrue. Prue incinerates Alec with his own power and switches their powers back just before he dies. Prue says that she never had to feel so much hate before and doesn't want to ever feel it again.

The sisters and Leo switch their powers back. Leo, himself, had been an Army medic in World War II. He died in the war and was offered the chance to become a Whitelighter. He accepted, but would give it all up for life with Piper. However, Piper thinks that would be too much of a loss for him.

Andy and Darryl meet at a noisy construction site. Rodriguez and Anderson are watching and using a long-range microphone, but the noise makes the microphone useless. Rodriguez, however, hears Andy mention Prue. Anderson wonders how that's possible. Suddenly, Rodriguez' eyes turn fiery red and he sonic screams. The sound penetrates Anderson's earphones, and he falls dead on the steering column.

Piper puts on Leo's dogtags, while Prue and Phoebe mix tropical drinks to make up for not making it to Cabo."

He is really a demon who was sent by The Source to find out why the ranks of evildoers have been decimated over the past few months. The demon Tempus appears to him. Tempus says he was sent by The Source to help kill the Charmed Ones, and offers to help Rodriguez.

Piper is at Quake planning a segment for the Food Network. She spilled marinara sauce on her dress, and asks Phoebe to bring her a new one. Across the street from the manor, a neighbor's car is hit. Prue has a newspaper announcing that Andy is suspected in Anderson's death. Phoebe takes the newspaper and has a premonition of herself and Piper bending over Andy's lifeless body. He looked as if he'd been hurled across the room by a demon or warlock.

Rodriguez calls in Andy and tells him that a supernatural being killed Anderson. He also knows Prue is a witch and wants to meet her. He will drop all charges against Andy, if Prue can help him find Anderson's killer. Andy pretends to scoff at the notion of Prue being a witch. Darryl enters; Andy says he needs to talk to Prue right away. Darryl reveals that Prue just called and wants to talk to him as well.

Rodriguez meets Tempus near a clock shop. He fully expects Andy to warn Prue, and is also certain Piper and Phoebe will be with her when they meet. Tempus doesn't think Rodriguez is powerful enough to kill the sisters, but Rodriguez is confident he'll succeed.

Phoebe goes to Quake and tells Piper of her premonition. The producer from the Food Network comes in -- an old classmate of Piper's, Joanne Hertz. Joanne brags about her life, humiliating Piper.

Prue goes to Andy and warns him of Phoebe's premonition. Andy suspects that the demon that killed Anderson is Rodriguez; it's the only feasible explanation for how he knows Prue's secret. Prue decides to meet Rodriguez at the manor, together with her sisters. Prue asks Andy not to come to the manor.

Rodriguez goes to the manor as Andy watches him enter. Kit is outside, and yowls at Rodriguez. Rodriguez rings the bell and Phoebe answers the door. Rodriguez shows his badge. Phoebe calls for her sisters. Suddenly, Rodriguez' eyes turn fiery red, and he throws an energy ball at Phoebe, killing her instantly. He throws another at Piper, but she freezes it, and then Prue deflects it back at Rodriguez, killing him. Tempus resets time and summons Rodriguez, still convulsing from the energy ball. Tempus tells Rodriguez he will remember what happened the previous times and to learn from his previous mistake.

Phoebe has a déjà vu experience. She believes the day is repeating, but Prue doesn't believe her. She hears the neighbor's car being hit again. Prue shows Phoebe the newspaper and Phoebe recognizes it, and the premonition.

Rodriguez cuts his deal with Andy again. He is in a much fouler mood than before. Back at the clock shop, Rodriguez remembers that he killed Phoebe before she could even react, but Piper froze the energy ball he threw at her. Tempus suggests anticipating where Piper will be and kill her first, before she has a chance to freeze him.

Phoebe goes to Quake and tells Piper of her déjà vu. When Joanne shows up, Phoebe knows her name and her bragging. Piper freezes Joanne and Phoebe tells Piper what Joanne said the last time. She thinks the only reason she knows what's happening is that her power allows her to see the past and the future.

Prue, again, goes to Andy. Again, she plans to meet Rodriguez and warns Andy to stay away.

Rodriguez, again, goes to the manor, with Andy watching. Kit yowls at Rodriguez. Phoebe has been searching the Book of Shadows for information on time loops; all she's found is a spell to accelerate time. Rodriguez bursts through the door and kills Phoebe with an energy ball. Before Piper can make a move, Rodriguez throws another energy ball at her, killing her. He hurls a third at Prue, but she deflects it back, killing him again. Tempus resets time and, again, summons Rodriguez. Rodriguez says he succeeded in part by killing two of the sisters, but Tempus tells him to learn where he erred so he can get them all.

Phoebe, again, has her déjà vu experience. She leads Prue to the window and shows her the neighbor's car being hit. She also tells Prue of her premonition, without having touched the newspaper. She's now convinced that they're caught in some sort of time loop and that she's the only one who recognizes this.

Rodriguez, now in a very foul mood, meets Tempus at the clock shop. He plans to kill Prue first this time.

Prue meets with Andy and tells him of the time loop. Andy suspects that the demon is after the Charmed Ones, not him. Prue still insists that he stay away from the manor.

Rodriguez, again, goes to the manor and, again, Kit yowls. Rodriguez glares demonically at Kit. Andy notices his reaction and realizes his hunch was right; Rodriguez is the demon. He pulls his gun out of the glove compartment and rushes out of his car.

The sisters find Tempus in the Book and see they must remove him from his time to send him away. At that moment, Rodriguez bursts into the manor and throws an energy ball at Prue, but Piper pushes Prue out of the way just in time. They both land hard on the floor; Prue is knocked out. Andy charges into the manor and shoots at Rodriguez, who kills him with an energy ball. However, Rodriguez is distracted and Piper freezes him. Piper and Phoebe tie Rodriguez to a chair. Phoebe wants to kill Rodriguez to restart the day and save Andy. Rodriguez is surprised that Phoebe knows about the time loop, and Phoebe reveals she knows about Tempus as well. Rodriguez dares Phoebe to kill him. Piper doesn't agree; she thinks that Rodriguez will kill them all, if the day is restarted again.

Prue meets Andy in a ghostly place. He knows he is dead, but thinks they weren't supposed to save him after all. He tells Prue to go back and continue the fight. Andy vanishes, and Prue hears Phoebe calling for her. Prue comes to and sees Andy dead.

The sisters find the time-acceleration spell in the Book. Piper and Phoebe think they should roll back time, but Prue thinks they have to accelerate time to break the time loop and get rid of Tempus. Prue casts the spell and time rolls forward to midnight, breaking the time loop. Tempus cries out and bursts into flames. Prue unties Rodriguez; she realizes he wouldn't have needed Tempus if he was powerful enough to kill them. Prue orders him to leave. Rodriguez walks to the door, but then, whirls around and throws an energy ball. Prue deflects it back at him and he is finally vanquished for good. Prue breaks down crying over Andy's body.

Andy is cleared of Anderson's murder and is buried with full honors.

Piper quits her job at Quake. She wants to be a chef and own a restaurant. Piper and Phoebe find Prue sitting outside. She tells them that Rodriguez is now the prime suspect in Anderson's murder, but they'll never find him. Prue thinks about all that's happened since they became witches; their lives have been thrown off a lot, but they've done a lot of good. The sisters head back inside, and Prue telekinetically swings the door closed behind them."

Harry, who is hiding, gets a glimpse of the man and the car the two drove of in. Meanwhile another car shows up taking pictures of Harry.

Donna is clearly afraid of Joe and says things aren't her fault. Joe ends up killing her.

The next day Cannon shows up at Harry's house. Harry learns that Donna is dead and wants answers. Cannon wants to know why Harry doesn't go to the police and Harry explains his wife doesn't know about the affair. Harry admits this was his only affair and after the physical aspect, he fell in love with Donna.

Cannon learns that Donna was part of a group who robbed a bank elsewhere. She was that bank president's secretary. However one of the robbers left with the money. The night of her murder, Donna was writing a letter to one of the others warning him. It seems another member had died mysteriously.

Cannon learns that guy was murdered and slowly each gang member is being bumped off.

We soon learn who ended up with the money, a man named Leon. The money is hot and he needs to exchange it for new bills. He blackmails Harry with comprising pictures of he and Donna.

Canon goes to Harry with all the info so far and as Harry discusses the blackmail, he finds it hard to believe Donna was using him to get access to it information that Leon needed. It's not clear if Donna was just using Harry or if she was in love with him and did what she did because her life is in danger.

Harry follows Leon's demands and takes the hot money which Jarey can exchange with fresh bank money. His bank sends old money for destruction so this is what he is being told to do with the hot Bill's. However Joe tracks down Leon and kills him. Now only Joe is left.

He goes to Harry's house where he is holding Harry and his wife. Joe wants the money and also let's out Harry's affair secret. Luckily Canon learns Harry is in danger and shows up in time, with police in tow. Joe is arrested and Canon suggests Harry try to patch things up with his wife."
