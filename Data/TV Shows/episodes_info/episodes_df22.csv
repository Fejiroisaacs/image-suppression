Harp slits the man's throat and also kills two other soldiers next to him. As Harp orders his men to pack up loot from the outpost (furs, gunpowder, muskets), they bring another soldier who had been hiding. Harp tells the soldier to go home and tell his officers that ""I am here"". At the HBC headquarters in London, Captain Chesterfield (Evan Jonigkeit) reads the report to Lord Benton (Alun Armstrong), who expresses some admiration for Harp's abilities. Benton had trained Harp and held him in high esteem until Harp deserted him to live with his mother's people. Benton promises to make an example of Harp. At a wharf in London, a young Irishman, Michael Smyth (Landon Liboiron) and his girlfriend, Clenna Dolan (Lyla Porter-Follows) and her brother run to shouts of ""Stop thief!"". However, they are disappointed to discover that their sack of loot consists solely of rotten fruit. Smyth spies a ship being loaded with gunpowder, and he develops a plan to steal gunpowder from the ship. In the Disputed Territory, Harp tells Rivard, a French fur trader, that he wants to meet with Rivard's employer, Samuel Grant, a wealthy American living in Montreal. Rivard tells Harp that he does not have enough furs to interest Grant. Harp says he will soon have an agreement with the Lake Walker tribe (Cree) to sell their furs. Back at the dock, Smyth and his friends sneak aboard the ship, as British soldiers talk about Lord Benton wanting to shove off for the New World that night. Smythe and Clenna grab a powder keg from below decks and start their getaway only to discover that soldiers have caught the brother. The soldiers stab the brother and throw him overboard. Clenna is captured and taken to prison. Michael escapes and hides below decks until morning, when he learns that the ship has set sail. He is now a stowaway. At Fort James in Canada, Father Coffin (Christian McKay) enters a tavern and talks with the proprietor, Grace Emberly, informing her that a ship carrying a senior HBC man will soon arrive. A drunken Governor Threadwell, dining at the next table, overhears and says that the ship carries Lord Benton and reinforcements. Michael is discovered aboard the ship, wrongly accused of theft, and is taken to see the ship's captain and Lord Benton. Benton offers Michael a job...find and join Harp's men, and then report back to Benton with Harp's location. Michael also asks that Clenna be released. In Montreal, Rivard arrives to ask Samuel Grant (Shawn Doyle) to travel to the Disputed Territory to meet Declan Harp. Grant does not wish to travel, but will meet if Harp comes to him. Benton's ship arrives in Fort James, and Michael disembarks. Father Coffin helps Michael escape being charged with murdering a soldier, and says that he is Michael's guide. They go to the Tavern to drink and eat. Grace wants to know what they are discussing and sends one of her workers, Mary (Breanne Hill) to eavesdrop. Michael drinks too much, and awakens at a stream. Father Coffin finds him, chased by two men who fire at them. Coffin says they are Xavier's men. Grace reports what was overheard to Lord Benton. Benton introduces Grace to his concubine, Imogen (Diane Bentley), and offers that Imogen will work in the tavern. Chesterfield tells Benton that he does not trust Grace, and Benton explains that they now have a spy working for her. Captain Chesterfield goes to the tavern and asks Mary if she saw Michael, and threatens her. Grace comes in and holds a knife to Chesterfield's gut and runs him out of the bar. A British soldier finds Michael and Father Coffin in the woods, and takes them to Chesterfield. He tells Michael that he has found a guide for him. That night, Michael and Coffin watch an Indian woman ambush the soldiers, who then tells them to come with her. She is Sokanon, a friend of Harp's. Michael and Coffin's hands are bound as they leave with her and her party. They arrive at a Lake Walker village, and Sokanon reports to Harp, who asks why they were with the soldiers. Harp is ready to kill them until Michael says he has information about Lord Benton. Harp will listen."

Tonight, he must attend the opening of his latest movie ""Head On,"" (co-starring Jessica Alba) but first he and his three best friends from back home (Queens, NY) have lunch and discuss their upcoming 10-year high school reunion. Vince is reluctant to go but his buddies urge him to go with them. Vince is always a favorite with the hot girls, while the girls will always ignore Drama.

E has been going out with a girl named Kristen whom both Drama & Turtle think is a bad influence. It seemed like E and Kristen had broken up, but E fell off the wagon and has been calling Kristen again. Ali Larter is angry with Vince for some reason, and E, Drama & Turtle go to considerable lengths to keep her away from Vince at the Premiere & the post premiere party. At the post-premiere party, Vince's agent, Ari, hassles Eric about getting Vince to read the script for a possible new project ""Matterhorn"". Ari wants an answer from Vince on whether he wants to do the film. At night E sleeps with a girl whom Drama & Turtle have introduced to E, as she looks like Kirsten (a revenge fuck). Over breakfast, Vince decides he's not going to do ""Matterhorn"" on Eric's advice. Eric read the script and didn't like it at all. E lives in the guest house. Drama is Vince's half-brother, but Turtle, E and Vince stayed with Drama for 2 years when they moved to Hollywood from Queens NYC.

The foursome goes to meet with the Matterhorn director (Vince wanted to cancel the meeting but then decided against it as it is rude to cancel at the last moment) where Vince impresses him so much that Ari calls later to tell him that they've offered Vince $4 million for the part (Vince only got paid $ 2 million for his last movie, so this is a big bump up). While Turtle and Drama celebrate, Vince lets Ari know that Eric is not too enthused about the script.

The guys adopt a guard dog for their house (suggested by Turtle), but the mutt is ferocious & the guys are afraid to get him out of his pen. Vince puts Turtle in a hockey goal-keeper suit & lets the dog rip at him, in exchange for a pass for Turtle to attend a party at the Playboy mansion.

Later, Ari and Eric share a rather confrontational dinner while discussing the future of their star's career. Ari tells E that he has been in business for 15 yrs, while E has been here only 14 months, & was running an Italian dinner joint (a pizzeria - E was the night manager at Sbarros) back on the East coast. He further insults E by saying that he never talks to the help.

Turtle and Drama tell E that they saw Kristen with Vince Vaughan. She had both her hands down his pants. They were kidding. After Vince decides to take Eric's advice not to do the movie, the boys leave for their reunion. Vince is ready to fire Ari, based on what E tells him. But E tells Vince to act more responsibly & Vince asks E to pick his projects for him. Before they can drive off, though, they get a call from Ari with some bad news: Colin Farrell has taken the part in Matterhorn. Vince makes Ari speak to E, which Ari hates.

While paying Ari an office visit to discuss it, Eric meets Ari's new assistant, Emily. Drama and Turtle sit outside, while Vince and E go for the meeting with Ari. Ari berates E for passing on Matterhorn, which could have been Vince's next job. E is worried that the bad review might hurt Vince's prospects, but Ari plays it down in front of Vince. Ari tells Vince to get a full-time manager, but Vince sticks with E (why pay a manager 10%, when E does the job for $4000 a month). Ari gives Vince a bunch of scripts to read.

Ari tells E, when Vince has left, that bad reviews always impact chances & that's why you book your next project before the movie is released. He says on Friday, when the movie releases, 200 reviews are going to be out & if they are all as bad as today's then Vince is in deep shit.

Following Ari's advice to show Vince a good time to get his mind off the review, Eric okays Vince's poor decision to buy a new Rolls Royce. But he convinces Vince to lease it, instead of buying it. Buying the Rolls would have cost $320,000. Marvin, Vince's business Manager tells E that Vince is out of money and buying a Rolls Royce was the stupidest idea that they all collectively had. Leasing it was even worse, as if they bought it, they could have sold it as well. Fortunately, E had gone to meet Marvin alone. Marvin tells E to tell Drama to ease up on his 2500$/month supplements and Turtle's 1500 $/month mobile bills (you can get an unlimited plan for $200/month) When E goes back to lunch with the guys, they are busy checking out houses, as the new car doesn't fit with their existing house. But the new ones cost $10 million.

Jessica Alba bumps into the boys during their luncheon and invites them to her party for Justine Chapin, her virginal pop-singer friend. The party proves to be a good time for everybody: Justine hits on Vince, Turtle shows off the Rolls to some girls, Eric gets some much-needed assurance (Ari berates E for letting Vince buy a RR, but then Vince reposes his faith in E by refusing to hire a full time manager saying that he trusts E's instincts and that Vince trusts E). Drama finds that he isn't the only one skipping his acting class. Vince decides to return the Rolls (as he thinks it makes them looks like ass), but E reminds him that he has signed a 3 year lease.

In the morning, Eric reads Vince a review from the New York Times proclaiming him to be ""the next Johnny Depp."" The guys head out to look for a new house, in celebration."

Vince agrees to appear on Jimmy's show the next day itself.

In the morning, the foursome discuss their past relationships with women, and the consensus (all but Eric) seems to be that it's better to leave a girl dangling than break up with her. Drama also fills Vince in on his old grudge against Jimmy Kimmel (Drama & Jimmy were friends, till Drama got kicked off his show (Melrose Place), ran out of money & had to move into a motel. He never heard from Jimmy again)

Shauna (Debi Mazar) is Vince's publicist, who is angry with Vince for not telling her that he was doing the Tonight Show with Jimmy. She is worried that Vince with Jimmy might put off Letterman or Leno. Later on, Eric tries his best to do a pre-interview for Vince's appearance while they all enjoy a game of golf. Afterwards, he breaks it to Vince that one of his one-night stands (Sara Foster) will be appearing on the show as well. Vince is not taking the Kimmel interview seriously and has decided to wing it. He has no stories to tell on the show.

E is picked on by Drama & Turtle as they know Kristen (Monica Keena) is coming by later to pick her stuff up. They beg E not to start with Kristen again. Every time E engages with Kristen he is out of commission for 2 weeks. Vince even offered to box her stuff and ship it, but E wont have that.

The day of the show, Kristen stops by the guest house to pick up some things from Eric where the visit quickly turns into ""break-up sex."" Kristen tells Eric that she believes that Vince has to stop seeing a girl before it gets serious, so that it never gets real for Vince & he never gets hurt. Meanwhile, Drama and Turtle visit Rufus, who tells them that if Vince plugs his company on the show (& wears their hat), they'll get their home theatre system for free. The Luke Wilson system was $190 K.

At the show, the boys go to the Green Room (which is supposedly stacked with girls like a trout pond), while Vince finds Sarah's room for a pre-show apology/visit. Vince & Sarah end up having sex right before the show. Emily (Ari's new assistant) shows up and shares a cigarette with Eric.

On the show Vince refuses to talk about his movie with Jimmy & instead brings up Jimmy's feud with Drama. Jimmy tells Vince that it was Drama who could not be found & Jimmy never bailed on him.

Vince's major work for the day is a stop at Big Boy's Neighbourhood, a local radio show. As a result of the appearance, Vince secures a date for himself with Justine Chapin. Basically, Vince announces on radio that since E got asked out on a date, he needs to find one as well. The radio host allows listeners to call in for a date with Vince and the first caller is Justine.

While everybody gets ready for the night's activities (Turtle has booked them 2 lanes at the Lucky Strike bowling alley), Ari video conferences with Eric to tell him that matinee numbers for Vince's movie have been ""less than stellar"" because it is in direct competition with the latest Pixar feature. Kristen also calls to confess to Eric that she might still harbor feelings for him. She also found out by radio that E got asked out on a date. Turtle resorts to desperate measures to get a date. Turtle picks a girl, Joanne, from Vince's fan mail, who had mailed Vince a naked picture of herself (she was hot). E takes Turtle aside and yells at him from bringing Joanne as she is psychotic.

Eric and Vince have dinner with Scott Wick, the movie's producer, thanks to Ari. Vince doesn't want to go (as he is not interested to work with a guy who doesn't like him), but Fiona convinces Vince that he would be able to charm Scott.

It's not going very well until Vince offers to hook Scott up after admitting to being high during the meeting. The three share a joint in Scott's car when a cop stops by to check up on them but Vince's charm and movie-star status saves them all.

The guys find that Billy is considered to be a genius director and everybody in town wants to work with him. Billy takes Vince and E for coffee. Billy hates studio movies and says that he is not in the business for money.

Vince likes Billy Walsh (Rhys Coiro), but Eric is getting a bad feeling, and they walk away with a script that he has made revisions to. Billy doesn't like E and calls him ""Suit"", he reference to the fact that he feels E wants Vince to do a studio movie.

The revision that causes the most uproar begins to cause some tension among the ranks. Billy has written a scene where a guy gives a blow job to Vince. Vince is open to doing the scene, but he doesn't understand why this scene is in the movie. The gang arrange for a meeting with Billy (who is at a strip club). Billy again convinces Vince that the blow job scene will not make him look gay. E doesn't trust Billy and says he is an egomaniac. Vince likes Billy and trusts him.

Ari says that the meeting was set up for Vince to approve Billy Walsh. All Vince has to do is to call the producer and Walsh is done. Ari tells E to watch some of Billy's old movies. Maybe Vince will hate the movie.

After hearing some reassuring wisdom, the boys screen Billy's previous film, which was a huge hit at Sundance. Amazingly, they all like it. The only problem now is that one gay scene. The next day, E is prepared to walk away if Billy doesn't cut the gay scene. Billy sticks to his guns & knows that he will be removed from the movie as Scott will never lose Vince. Vince is amazed by Billy's passion for the movie and agrees. E agrees as well, seeing that Vince has agreed. That's when Billy reveals that there is no gay scene in the movie and that it was a test for Vince, that he trusted Billy completely.
