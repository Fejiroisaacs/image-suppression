Bowl-off-a-thon - only to discover that everyone at MIFT stinks at bowling.",[],TV-G,Release date,"['Kay Ritter', 'Stephen J. Anderson']","['', '', '']",[],"['bowling', 'three word title']",[],"Monsters, Inc. is hosting their annual Bowl-Off-a-Thon, and the prize this year is a reservation for two at Harryhausen's (which Mike has been un-banned from since he became SCPOMICE-VDADOCREM). Mike's co-worker and rival Gary Gibbs (the reigning champion) is entering the competition. Tylor and Val are repairing a machine at the bowling alley (where Tylor says that he doesn't like bowling), and they run into Mike, who wants to sponsor a team in the competition. Tylor asks MIFT if they know any good bowlers, and Fritz, Val, and Cutter say that they are highly skilled bowlers, and they decide to form a team and ask Tylor to be their team captain. Tylor accepts, and they form a team named ""The Big Wazowskis"". Mike then bets Gary that the loser has to do the winner's paperwork for a month.

The team starts training, and they discover that Tylor is very good at bowling, but that Fritz, Val, and Cutter are very bad. The team then wins the first two rounds on a technicality, before making it to the final round against Gary's team. Mike (who wasn't at the match) believes that the team won legitimately, and makes another bet with Gary that the loser has to be the winner's butler for a month.

Duncan offers Tylor an opportunity to replace the other members of the team with a group of night-shift workers / professional bowlers, in exchange for Tylor signing a contract to never take Fritz's position (which Tylor doesn't want to do anyway). Tylor tells Fritz, Val, and Cutter that the final round of the tournament has been canceled, and arrives at the tournament with the professional bowlers, but Fritz, Val, and Cutter show up anyway, and the professional bowlers quit because of Tylor's behavior. Tylor then apologizes to his teammates for lying, and encourages his teammates to re-join the team and win the tournament. The team uses their poor skills to their advantage, but the tournament ends in a tie, and the Harryhausen's reservation is split between Mike and Gary.

At Mike's Comedy Class, Mike talks about how to ignore hecklers in the audience. Gary then starts heckling, and Mike completely fails to ignore him."

The story is strong and compelling, leaving you uncertain of the outcome until virtually the last moment. The theme music by Percy Faith is western magic for the ear."

While the Fake KC is continuing with her deception, including going to School, where her change in behavior draws the attention of Marissa, who thinks KC is acting odd. Meanwhile back to the real KC who has used the mouse to spy on Zane, she learns that the plan to infiltrate the Organization has a snag-the most classified documents can only be accessed by agents with maximum clearance, there is a safeguard in place that requires two agents with Maximum clearance to do this, which is why Zane needs the fake KC. But Zane is spying on KC and overhears her listening to her spy recording, he tells her that none can stop him and lays out a mouse trap for her little friend, proving none can escape his vengeance . Meanwhile a computer virus is affecting all of Ernie's hard drives including the one in Judy who goes on the fritz and shuts off. Marissa visits Ernie to tell him that something is funny about the way KC has been acting lately but Ernie being Ernie he only spends the time flirting with Marissa. As Marissa is leaving fake KC enters the house with Brett (Zane's son) Fake KC senses that Marissa is on to them, and mention she plans to eliminate Marissa when the mission is over . Later on Marissa warns Kira that KC is acting Strange but Kira just feels that Marissa is upset because KC now has a boyfriend, KC comes in and leaves with Marissa, once outside Marissa begins to probe KC, finally she tricks KC and catches her in a lie, she knows that this KC is a fake, the Fake KC knocks out Marissa, and brings her to the Barn, and chains her up across from the real KC. Zane leaves with the fake KC to bring about the end game to his plans. In the barn , the two friends are glad to see each other, but are still handcuffed in place, Marissa takes lipstick out of her pocket, explaining that when she gets nervous she likes to put on make-up, KC excitedly asks Marissa if she swiped that Lipstick from her table, Marissa says she did and hopes KC won't be mad, KC tells her to throw the lipstick to her, when KC gets the lipstick she points it at the spy camera, a laser shoots out of the lipstick and destroys the camera, its obvious that this is one of KC's secret weapons, she then frees Marissa and herself, and goes after Zane and fake KC. Meanwhile back at the Cooper house, Ernie has repaired Judy, they go down to the kitchen area to dine with Kira and Craig, Kira becomes upset with Craig accusing him of eating the meatballs she had leftover in the fridge, but Craig says he didn't do it. Kira is stumped and is trying to figure out who ate the meatballs when Judy chimes in saying sarcasticly wouldn't it be nice if the family had a robot who filmed the incident-oh wait you do. Judy shines hologram video from her hard drive that shows it was KC who ate the meatballs, which finally reveals the truth, as there is no way Vegan KC would ever eat Meatballs, the family puts two and two together and realizes that they have been tricked-they immediately head to the Organization headquarters. Meanwhile at the HQ, Brett knocks out the agent guarding the mainframe in the computer room, the real KC Enters but Brett thinks it's the Fake which allows KC to get the drop on him, they fight and KC knocks him out and tells him that they are officially broken up-and it was his fault. Fake KC enters and the two girls fight, it's an even battle, Kira, Craig and a squad of agents enter and point guns at the two girls, but can't figure out who the real KC is, Craig questions both girls, but the Fake seems to know everything about KC, Kira gives it a shot and asks a trick question, that concerns a incident where KC peed on herself on her first day of school, but when the Fake answers she knows-because the real KC would never talk about the incident ever again. The family unites but their joy is short lived, somehow Zane appears on the video monitor in the computer room, Zane has taken Ernie and Judy hostage and tells Craig to return to the house to confront him. Back at the house, Craig tells Kira to keep Zane talking while he sneaks into the house, in the house Ernie is tied to a chair and Judy is in pieces-she tried to protect Ernie and Zane dismantled her. While Zane laments what could have been if Kira had picked him-this could have been my house, etc. meanwhile Craig sneaks in through the side door, and taking one of Judy's dismantled arms hit Zane in the gut and then clobbers him over the back knocking him out. The family is finally united and they hug. The episode ends with KC and Marissa in the backyard sitting next to each other, KC thanks Marissa for saving them and tells her even when she does get a boyfriend their relationship will always be special to her, Marissa asks KC to go with her to a party on the weekend, but KC in usual KC fashion says no way, which makes Marissa wonder if they can get the fake KC back for times she wants to go to parties or shopping, the two girls laugh and hug."

Kurt, who is Greek, proves to be a great addition to the Fawlty Towers staff, and gets on very well with everyone, and seems to take a particular liking to Manuel. With this new asset to their team, Basil organizes a gourmet night, to climb another rung in the social ladder.

On the gourmet night itself, a series of mishaps occur. First of all, Basil's social awkwardness confuses and offends the dinner guests. Secondly, Kurt, who turns out to be gay and alcoholic, gets a crush on Manuel and is promptly rejected, leaving him to get drunk and fall unconscious. Hastily, Basil has to cancel the gourmet menu, and can only offer the guests three options: Duck with orange, duck with cherries, or ""duck surprise"" (duck without orange or cherries). Basil leaves Polly and Manuel to entertain the guests while he goes to Andre's restaurant to collect the duck.

Throughout the ordeal, Basil's car has been having mechanical issues, which proves problematic while he rushes between Fawlty Towers and Andre's restaurant. After Basil collects the duck, he brings it back to the hotel, where it accidentally gets dropped on the kitchen floor, prompting Basil to rush back into town to get another duck from Andre. Andre prepares a new duck for Basil, which Basil eagerly collects. However, unbeknownst to Basil or Andre, the duck has been unintentionally swapped with a pudding. On the way back to Fawlty Towers, the car stalls again, then promptly fails to restart, leaving Basil to take out his frustration by beating the vehicle with a tree branch.

Eventually, Basil returns to the hotel, places the dish on a trolley, and wheels it out to the hungry guests. However, upon removing the cloche, it reveals the pudding underneath. When one of the guests asks about the duck, Basil bluntly responds: ""Duck's off."""
