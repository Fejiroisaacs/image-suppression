Elrond is presented with an intriguing new venture. Nori breaks a deeply held community rule.,[],TV-14,Release date,['J.A. Bayona'],"['', '', '']",[],"['kingdom', 'fellowship', 'ring', 'community', 'venture', 'evil', 'discovery', 'power', 'series premiere', 'season premiere']",[],"The Elf Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) grew up in Valinor during a time of peace. When the two trees that lit the world were destroyed by the Dark Lord Morgoth, the Elves sailed across the Sundering Seas to Middle-earth and waged a devastating war against him that lasted for centuries. After Morgoth was defeated, his Orcs continued to spread around the world led by his servant Sauron (Charlie Vickers), a powerful sorcerer. Galadriel's brother Finrod (Will Fletcher) died hunting Sauron, and Galadriel vowed to continue the search. She searched Middle Earth for many centuries, and yet the trail of Sauron grew thin. Many elves now believed that Sauron was just a memory.

Thousands of years later, Galadriel and a company of Elves discover an abandoned fortress in the northern wastelands of Forodwaith. They find evidence of black magic and an anvil bearing Sauron's mark. Galadriel believes this is part of a trail left for Orcs to follow. The company are attacked by a snow-troll and sustain injuries before it is killed by Galadriel. She commands that they continue the search north, but the others refuse claiming that the mark is centuries old, and she reluctantly returns to the Elven capital of Lindon.

In the Wilderlands of Rhovanion in the east of Middle-earth, a community of nomadic Harfoots-small, secretive beings-are surprised to see human hunters passing nearby at an uncommon time of year. Harfoot elder Sadoc Burrows (Lenny Henry) also believes the stars are appearing when they should not. A group of young Harfoots, including Nori Brandyfoot (Markella Kavenagh) and Poppy Proudfellow (Megan Richards), go to a nearby farm to eat berries but they return to camp when they discover wolf footprints.

Galadriel meets with her friend Elrond (Robert Aramayo), the herald and speech-writer for High King Gil-Galad (Benjamin Walker), in Lindon. Galadriel tries to convince Elrond that Sauron has escaped and is hiding in Middle Earth. She wants the King to authorize another expedition to continue searching to Sauron. Elrond tells Galadriel that she defied the King by not following his commands in the previous expeditions, and yet the King chose to honor her achievements and ignore her insolence. Gil-Galad proclaims the war to be over and grants Galadriel's company the great honor of sailing across the sea to Valinor where they can live an eternal life at peace. Galadriel intends to turn down this offer, but Elrond convinces her that it is time to stop fighting. Elrond says that perhaps Sauron is dead since he has not been seen for centuries. He later talks to Gil-Galad, who has foreseen that Galadriel's search for Sauron could help the latter endure. Gil-Galad introduces Elrond to a great Elven-smith, Lord Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards ), who is beginning an important new project that Gil-Galad wants Elrond to help with.

Word that the war is over, reaches a group of Elves in the Southlands of Middle-earth who have been watching over Tirharad, a village of Men descended from allies of Morgoth. This means that all the far outposts of Elves are being disbanded and being ordered to return back to Lindon. One of the Elves, Arondir (Ismael Cruz Córdova), has grown close with the human healer Bronwyn (Nazanin Boniadi) and is with her when a villager arrives with a sick cow. It had wandered to the nearby village of Hordern, and when Arondir and Bronwyn investigate that town, they find it in flames. Meanwhile, Bronwyn's son Theo (Tyroe Muhafidin) finds a broken sword bearing Sauron's mark.

Across the Sundering Seas, Galadriel and her company prepare to enter Valinor which appears as a great light. Galadriel has second thoughts about abandoning her search for Sauron and jumps from the ship. At the same time, a meteor flies across Middle-earth and crashes near the Harfoots' camp. Nori finds a strange man in the crater."

Arondir searches for answers while Bronwyn warns her people of a threat.,[],TV-14,Release date,['J.A. Bayona'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Nori Brandyfoot and Poppy Proudfellow investigate the strange man inside the meteor crater and are surprised to find him alive, surrounded by cold fire. They struggle to move him away from the crater and into a makeshift shelter. The next day, Nori gives him food and realizes that he does not speak their language as he attempts to communicate something to them. Nori and Poppy later find the Stranger (Daniel Weyman) looking at the stars. He uses magic to break open Poppy's lantern of fireflies and arrange them into a constellation that Nori does not recognize. She believes that they can help him by finding that constellation. When the Stranger stops using the magic, the fireflies all die. Sadoc Burrows wants to evacuate the village due to the omens. But Nori's father Largo Brandyfoot (Dylan Smith) incurs an injury while erecting a tent and twists his ankle. He can no longer migrate. Nori's mother Marigold (Sara Zwangobani) tends to Largo.

In the ruins of Hordern, Arondir and Bronwyn find no survivors or bodies. They discover a tunnel below one of the houses and Arondir enters to discover where it came from. They both agree that men have not dug the tunnel. Bronwyn returns to Tirharad to warn the other villagers, but they dismiss her. In the tunnel, Arondir is captured by unknown creatures. Bronwyn returns home and finds Theo hiding from an Orc that has burst from beneath their floor-boards. Bronwyn and Theo kill the orc and use its head to convince the other villagers to flee the town for the near-by tower of the Elven watchers. Theo brings the broken sword, which appears to draw power from a bleeding wound on Theo's wrist.

Elrond and Celebrimbor discuss the latter's new project in Eregion, the realm of the Elven smiths. Celebrimbor is planning to build a forge capable of creating powerful objects and requires a workforce that High King Gil-Galad is unable to provide. The forge must be strong enough to endure heat as intense as a dragon's tongue and as pure as starlight. Elrond suggests they look to the Dwarves for help, and they travel to Khazad-Dum to meet with his old friend Prince Durin IV (Owain Arthur). Elrond is surprised to find that he is not welcome there, and invokes the rite of Sigin-Tarag, a rock-breaking contest between himself and Durin. The contestant who first fails to break a rock with their hammer, loses the contest.

Elrond loses the contest, which means he is to be banished from all Dwarven lands. As Durin escorts him out, Elrond learns that he is not welcome because he has not visited in 20 years. Durin is offended that Elrond missed his wedding and the birth of his children. Elrond apologizes to Durin and his wife Disa (Sophia Nomvete), who encourages the pair to make up. Durin agrees to hear Elrond's proposal, which he later relays to King Durin III. The latter is concerned that Elrond's arrival relates to a new discovery that the Dwarves have made.

Swimming back to Middle-earth, Galadriel encounters a raft of stranded humans escaping from a sea creature that destroyed their ship. The creature attacks the raft, leaving only Galadriel and one of the Men alive. He introduces himself as Halbrand (Charlie Vickers) of the Southlands, and explains that he is escaping from Orcs who have attacked his homeland. They are caught in a storm and Halbrand saves Galadriel from drowning. The next morning, the pair are found by an unknown ship."

These allow the Orcs, who are sensitive to sunlight, to move during the day. Arondir finds his fellow Elves Médhor (Augustus Prew) and Revion (Simon Merrells) have also been brought there, and they begin planning their escape. When Revion refuses to cut down a tree in their path, the Orcs kill Médhor. Arondir agrees to cut down the tree. He sees that the surrounding area has become poisoned and desolate. Arondir believes that the Orcs are searching for something, due to which they pillage village after village. The prisoners discuss that perhaps Morgoth has a successor and his name is Adar, which is a Elvish name.

Galadriel and Halbrand are picked up by a ship captained by Elendil (Lloyd Owen) who takes them to Numenor, an island kingdom ruled by Men. The Men of Numenor stood with Elves in the battle against Morgoth, while the Men of middle earth supported Morgoth. After the war, the Valar granted the Island of Numenor to the Men as a reward. For many centuries, Elves were welcome in Numenor. But eventually, Numenor began to break all contact with the Elves and it was never clear why. Relations between the island and the Elves have grown strained, and Queen Regent Míriel (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) denies Galadriel's request for a ship back to Middle-earth. Miriel is also not happy with Elendil for bringing Galadriel to Numenor and questions his loyalty to the Kingdom of Men. Elendil is assigned to watch over Galadriel and he takes her to the kingdom's Hall of Lore. Galadirel is astonished that many Men in Numenor still speak Elvish. Galadriel learns that Miriel's father was loyal to the Elves and was deposed due to this. He is now a captive in his own kingdom. They discover that the mark of Sauron is actually a map of the Southlands, where a new realm for evil forces is planned, by the successor of Morgoth. Galadriel believes that Sauron has now returned.

Halbrand gets into a fight with some Númenóreans and is imprisoned. Galadriel finds him and reveals that she knows he is the true king of the Southlands, descended from the Man who united the tribes of the Southland and was loyal to Morgoth. She asks him to return to Middle-earth with her to redeem both of their bloodlines. Galadriel's family started the war and Hallbrand says that his family lost it. Meanwhile, Elendil's son Isildur (Maxim Baldry) nears the end of his training as a naval cadet, but has been encouraged by his brother Anárion to postpone his graduation against Elendil's wishes. Elendil wants Isindur to join the Navy as a full time sailor and not as a trainee cadet. Earien (Ema Horvath) is Isildur's sister.

The evening before the Harfoots' next migration, the Stranger accidentally reveals himself to the rest of the Harfoots while trying to read some star maps that Nori stole for him from Sadoc. Nori reckoned that the Stranger was looking for a specific constellation and that they could only find it in Sadoc's map, which were very detailed as Sadoc is an avid astronomer. The shocked Harfoots consider exiling Nori Brandyfoot for helping the Stranger, but she is forgiven because of her young age. The next day, the Harfoots start migrating and the Brandyfoots struggle to keep up due to Largo, Nori's father, who has an injured ankle. The Stranger follows them, and helps them with their cart.

Arondir, Revion, and some other captives attempt to escape from the Orcs when the sun is highest. The Orcs send a Warg to attack them, which Arondir kills. Revion makes it out of the trench but is killed by archers. Arondir is unable to get free and is brought before the mysterious leader of the Orcs, Adar (Joseph Mawle)."

Miriel refuses and Galadriel asks to speak with her father, King Tar-Palantir, who hasn't been seen in years. Galadriel openly challenges Miriel's authority to refuse her proposal and says that it is her destiny that brought her to Numenor and united her with Hallbrand. Miriel has Galadriel imprisoned. Isildur and his friends Valandil (Alex Tarrant) and Ontamo (Anthony Crum) are dismissed from their cadet training after Isildur makes a mistake while distracted. Isildur makes the mistake deliberately since he did not want to be enlisted in the Naval service and wanted to explore the West lands as his brother asked him to.

Arondir meets Adar, the leader and ""father"" of the Orcs who is an Elf. He lets Arondir leave with a message for the Southlanders who are taking refuge in the Elven watchtower of Ostirith: forsake their claims to the Southlands and swear fealty to Adar, or they will be destroyed.

The villagers have taken refuge in the military watchtower abandoned by the Elves after the King declared the war to be over. But the tower now has far too many people and not enough food. Meanwhile, Theo wants to be helpful but is ignored by Bronwyn. He and Rowan (Ian Blackburn) return to Tirharad to recover food from the tavern and are attacked by Orcs. Rowan escapes back to the tower while Theo is forced to hide in a well. He uses the hilt of Sauron's sword to defend himself against the Orc. Turns out the Orcs were looking for the hilt.

In Eregion, the Elves and Dwarves are working together to build Celebrimbor's powerful new forge. Celebrimbor believes Durin IV is hiding something, and Elrond goes to investigate. He learns that Durin IV has been mining a new ore that is very light and very strong below Khazad-Dum. Elrond promises to keep this secret and gives it the name ""Mithril"". Durin IV says that mining Mithril is perilous and hence the mining activity has to be kept hidden from the King Durin III. When the mine collapses, King Durin III shuts down further Mithril mining. Durin IV is furious at his father, but Elrond calms him with a story of his own father, Earendil, who became a star after Valar lifted him in the sky after he helped defeat Morgoth in battle. Durin IV reconciles with his father, who sends him to Lindon to find out what the Elves' intentions are.

Halbrand helps Galadriel realize that she should go around Miriel and speak to Tar-Palantir directly. It was the demand to speak to the King directly, which sparked Miriel's anger against Galadriel. Guards arrive to release Galadriel and escort her to Middle-earth, but Galadriel escapes and climbs up the king's tower. She finds the king in ill health, protected by Miriel. The latter explains that there was a rebellion because the king wanted to renew relations with the Elves, and Miriel was placed on the throne in his stead. After becoming ruler, Miriel was given access to a Palantír (crystal ball) that first showed her the vision of Numenor's downfall. She shows this vision to Galadriel and explains her belief that helping Galadriel will bring upon this cataclysmic future. Galadriel convinces Miriel to have faith and to let her leave for Middle-Earth.

Arondir rescues Theo from the Orcs and they return to the tower. Tavern owner Waldreg (Geoff Morrell) reveals to Theo that he is a follower of Sauron and explains that the broken sword was a gift for the followers of the Dark Lord. The Orcs who attacked Theo know he has the sword and report back to Adar that it is in the tower.

As Galadriel departs for Middle-earth, the petals of Numenor's White Tree begin to fall. Miriel says this signifies the tears of the Valar and changes her mind. She announces that she will personally escort Galadriel to Middle-earth and assist the Men of the Southlands. Isildur, Valandil, and Ontamo volunteer to join the expeditionary force."

While looking for food in a forest, Nori Brandyfoot, Poppy Proudfellow, and Malva Meadowgrass (Thusitha Jayasundera) are attacked by a pack of wolves. The Stranger accompanying them intervenes and uses magic to scare off the wolves, but his use of magic injures his own arm. He uses more magic to heal himself and nearly hurts Nori, frightening her. Meanwhile, a trio of mysterious women find the location where the Stranger fell from the sky.

The Orcs cannot venture into sunlight as this skin burns on contact with it. Adar assures the Orcs that soon, the sunlight will be gone. At the tower of Ostirith in the Southlands, Bronwyn attempts to prepare the other human refugees to defend themselves from the army of Orcs that are coming to claim their lands. Tavern owner Waldreg thinks they will be better off joining the Orcs and convinces around half of the refugees to leave with him. Waldreg is disappointed to learn that the leader of the Orcs, Adar, is not Sauron, but still chooses to serve him. To confirm his loyalty, Adar orders Waldreg to kill one of the other humans, Rowan. At the tower, Theo shows Arondir the broken sword the Orcs are hunting for and Arondir realizes that it is some sort of key designed to enslave the Southlanders. Meanwhile, the Orcs, led by Adar are marching on the tower of Ostirith.

Elendil denies his son Isildur's request to join Numenor's expedition to the Southlands, saying Isildur lost his chance to serve previously when he refused to be part of the naval service. Discussing the expedition with Queen Regent Miriel, Galadriel says the human Halbrand will be accompanying them to claim the throne of Southlands. Halbrand says that the enemy will be concentrated around the watchtower of Ostirith. Halbrand accuses Galadriel of using him and says he wants to remain in Numenor instead. Galadriel argues that she has convinced Miriel to send 5 ships and 500 men to help Halbrand's people and to place his crown over his head. At the town square Galadriel challenges Valandil for a sword fight. Galadriel demonstrates how balance is more important in a sword fight than brute force. She easily dispatches 5 soldiers, but Valandil manages to scratch her dress, earning her praise and a promotion from Miriel. Now, Valandil is on the expedition and Elendil has refused to take Isildur. Isildur begs Valandir to take him on the expedition, but Valandir refuses, saying that Isildur might decide to abandon it mid-way after getting distracted by something else.

Meanwhile, Chancellor Pharazon's (Trystan Gravelle) son Kemen (Leon Wadham) attempts to convince his father to cancel the expedition to Middle-earth, but Pharazon sees potential in turning the Southlands into a tributary state after its liberation. Kemen is close to Isidrul's sister Earien. Miriel's father, King Tar-Palantir, warns her not to go to Middle-earth.

Elrond takes Durin IV for a feast with High-King Gil-Galad. High-King Gil-Galad reveals to Elrond that he knows of the existence of Mithril, an ore that contains the light from a lost Silmaril that he believes can counteract the fading power of the Elves in Middle-earth. The light from the Silmaril was generated in the roots of a tree, when an Elve and a Morgoth warrior were fighting around it, with each warrior pouring its powers into the tree. A lightening bolt struck the tree at that moment and carried the powers of good and evil into the ground below, where if waited for centuries to be discovered. Elrond refuses to confirm that the Dwarves have discovered the ore, out of loyalty to Prince Durin IV, and Gil-Galad accuses him of putting the Dwarves before his own race. Celebrimbor convinces Elrond that he has tested Mithril himself, and it is indeed the salvation that the Elves have been looking for. Elves will need vast quantities of it quickly to ward off the coming darkness. Elrond later discusses the issue with Durin IV (that Elves will die by spring, unless they have the Mithril, or they must leave Middle-Earth to go back to their homeland) and the latter agrees to help. The pair return to Khazad-Dum to try and convince King Durin III.

Kemen attempts to destroy the expedition ships and discovers Isildur stowing away. Isildur prevents the destruction of three of the five ships and saves Kemen's life. When questioned by Elendil, Isildur lies about Kemen's sabotage. He subsequently receives a spot on the expedition crew, as a stable sweep. Galadriel apologizes for using Halbrand and opens up to him. She says she has fought the evil for centuries that consumed her brother, and she cannot stop till the evil is defeated. He eventually decides to go with the expeditionary force, and the remaining ships depart for Middle-earth."

While they search for refugees from the Southlands town of Tirharad, the Elf Arondir triggers a booby-trap that collapses the tower on the army. The townspeople, who had moved down the valley to the village, cheer as the tower falls. Meanwhile, Galadriel, Queen Regent Miriel, and soldiers from Numenor make their way towards the Southlands by ship. Galadriel meets Isildur, and learns from his father Elendil that Isildur's mother drowned.

Arondir attempts to destroy the broken sword that the Orcs are searching for but is unable to with conventional tools. He tells the human healer Brownyn that he is going to hide it as her son Theo watches on from a distance. Arondir helps the town prepare for the next assault. He professes his love to Bronwyn and promises a life together with her and Theo after the battle is over. That night, the Orc army enters Tirharad. The townspeople trap the Orcs in the center of the village. The Orcs fight back and the battle is brutal. Arondir leads the assault and defeats the largest Orc and the townspeople are victorious, but soon realize that many of the enemies they just killed were their neighbors, who joined Adar and had been disguised as Orcs. The townspeople are horrified with their actions.

Now, emerging from their hiding spots, the Orc archers start shooting arrows at the townsfolk, killing and wounding many. Bronwyn is hit in the shoulder. Taking refuge in the tavern, Theo and Arondir cauterize Bronwyn's wound. Adar enters the town and demands the location of the broken sword. Arondir attempts to negotiate, but the Orcs continue to kill people. At this moment, the Numenor army has reached Middle Earth and is galloping towards the Southlands. When Bronwyn is threatened, Theo reveals the sword and gives it to Adar. Adar orders the rest of the humans to be killed, but the Numenorean army arrives on horseback and kills or captures the remaining Orcs. Adar gives Waldreg a task before attempting to escape, only to be captured by Galadriel and Halbrand. They recover a wrapped item from Adar, which looks like the hilt that he took from Theo. Halbrand wants to kill Adar, but Galadriel stops him and says that she needs Adar alive. It is implied that Adar had killed Halbrand's family.

Galadriel interrogates Adar, discovering that he is an Elf who was corrupted by the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, and turned into one of the first Orcs (The Uruks). After Morgoth's defeat, Sauron devoted himself to healing Middle-earth and bringing the ruined lands together in perfect order. Adar claims that Sauron sought to craft a power, not of the flesh, but in the unseen world. Yet, he notes that Sauron failed as there was a shadow of dark knowledge that kept itself hidden from him. Sauron could not achieve his goals, despite the lives sacrificed in Sauron's name, including Adar's ""children"", the Orcs. Adar claims to have killed the second Dark Lord, Sauron, and is now focused on creating a home for all Orcs. Galadriel says that Orcs was a life created in mockery and as slaves and vows to eradicate every last one of them.

Halbrand is hailed as the King of the Southlands and the Numenoreans celebrate their victory. Theo realizes that the broken sword is missing as Waldreg uses it to unlock the dam beside Ostirith. Water rushes into tunnels that the Orcs dug to the mountain Orodruin. The water enters a lava chamber beneath the mountain and the resulting pressure causes an eruption that spews lava, ash, and smoke over the Southlands. The ash and the smoke blots out the sun, thus creating perfect living conditions for the Orcs."

The village of Tirharad is covered in ash and fire, with many dead and injured. Galadriel finds the human boy Theo and together they begin making their way out of the Southlands. Numenorean soldiers Isildur and Valandil find their friend Ontamo dead. They help Queen Regent Miriel rescue survivors from a burning building, but it collapses and Miriel loses her eyesight. Isildur is presumed dead in the collapse.

The Harfoots finish their migration to the Grove, an orchard that has been destroyed by the nearby volcano. They ask the magical Stranger who has joined them to help fix the orchard, but his attempts lead to a large tree branch landing on Nori and Dilly Brandyfoot. Scared, the Harfoots decide the Stranger should leave. Harfoot elder Sadoc Burrows gives him directions to a nearby settlement of Men and the Stranger departs. Sadoc tells the Stranger that the star constellations he seeks have not been seen for over a thousand years. The next day, the Harfoots awake to find the whole orchard regrown. That night, a trio of mysterious women arrive in search of the Stranger. They seem to be able to follow the Stranger with the trail of his magic. Nori attempts to send them in the wrong direction but the women use magic to burn all of the Harfoot caravans and then continue after the Stranger. Nori decides to go after him to warn him of the danger, and is accompanied by her friend Poppy Proudfellow, her mother Marigold, and Sadoc.

Galadriel and Theo bond over their shared guilt for the events leading to the eruption, and Galadriel discusses her husband Celeborn whom she believes to be dead. Theo blames himself for giving the hilt to Adar which brought upon this cataclysm on their lands. They eventually reach the Numenorean camp outside of the Southlands where Theo is reunited with his mother Bronwyn and her beloved, the Elf Arondir. Isildur's father Elendil learns of his son's loss and despairs, regretting his part in joining Galadriel's quest that led to this moment. When Isildur's horse cannot be calmed, Elendil lets the horse gallop off. Miriel gives the orders to leave Middle-Earth and to return to Numenor. Before the Numenoreans depart Middle-earth in their ships, Miriel promises to return and seek revenge against the enemy. Galadriel does not believe that Miriel will ever keep her promise to return to Middle-Earth. Galadriel is reunited with Halbrand, the King of the Southlands, who was gravely injured during the eruption. She helps him ride north to receive Elvish medicine. The other human survivors seek refuge in nearby Pelargir.

In Khazad-Dum, the Elf Elrond and Dwarf Prince Durin IV ask King Durin III for permission to mine the new ore Mithril so it can be used to counteract the fading power of the Elves in Middle-earth. Elrond offers riches and support to the Dwarfs for 5 centuries in exchange for access to the mines. Durin III refuses, believing the ore to be too dangerous to mine. As Elrond departs with a tearful farewell for Durin IV and his wife Disa, Durin IV sees proof that Mithril can save the Elves (An Elven leaf with blight on it, is cured in the presence of a Mithril specimen) and decides to mine it with Elrond in secret. They find a large deposit of the ore, but are caught by Durin III. Elrond is banished, taking a small piece of Mithril with him, and Durin IV is stripped of his royal status when he insists that Elrond is like a brother to him and helping him is his sacred duty. Durin III orders the Mithril mine to be sealed. Unbeknownst to them all, a Balrog lives deep below that mine.

In the Southlands, the Orcs and their human allies name their leader, Adar, ""Lord of the Southlands"". He says that place no longer exists: it is now the land of Mordor."

New alliances are forged.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Wayne Che Yip'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"The Harfoots Nori Brandyfoot, Poppy Proudfellow, Marigold Brandyfoot, and Sadoc Burrows search for the Stranger, their friend, in the Greenwood, but he is first found by a trio of mysterious women known as the Dweller (Bridie Sisson), the Nomad (Edith Poor), and the Ascetic (Kali Kopae). They tell him that he is their Lord Sauron, and plan to restore his memories and power. They reveal to the Stranger that the constellation he seeks is visible in the East, in the land of the Rhun.

In Eregion, the Elven smith Celebrimbor believes they do not have enough of the ore Mithril to counteract the fading of Elven power in Middle-earth. As he and Elrond prepare to inform High King Gil-Galad, Galadriel arrives with the gravely injured human Halbrand, the King of the Southlands. As Halbrand begins to recover, he grows interested in Celebrimbor's work and suggests a way to create one small object with the Mithril they have that would have power of both the seen and unseen world. Gil-Galad is against the idea since he doesn't want all the power to be concentrated in one object that can be controlled by one person, but Galadriel convinces him that it is worth trying. Still, she grows suspicious of Halbrand and asks for records on his lineage.

With the King of Numenor, Tar-Palantir, growing ill, Chancellor Pharazon organizes members of the Builders' Guild to begin designing a tomb. Apprentice Earien is given an hour by the king's bed to plan a design, during which the king awakes and mistakes her for his daughter, the Queen Regent Miriel. He leads her up his tower to a Palantir (crystal ball) and warns her not to look in it for too long. The king dies soon afterward, before Miriel and Earien's father Elendil return from Middle-earth. During the voyage Miriel and Elendil have grown close together.

The Harfoots find the Stranger and attempt to rescue him from the women, but the women kill Sadoc and nearly kill the others. The Stranger has no will to fight, as he believes that he is the reincarnation of evil. But Nori says that she has seen the good in him and only he can decide what he wants to be. The Stranger, regaining his memories and receiving encouragement from Nori, uses the magic staff of the Dweller to reveal the dark true forms of the women and banish them back to the unseen world. Before they go, they realize that he is not Sauron but rather an Istar. Nori, Marigold, and Poppy return with the Stranger to the other Harfoots where he explains that Istar means Wizard, and he needs to travel east to the land of Rhun to learn more about his powers and purpose. With the encouragement of her family, Nori goes with him.

Halbrand and Celebrimbor work together to combine Mithril with other elements and decide that they will need two small, circular objects. They finally decide to forge 2 rings instead of the one crown as planned earlier. Galadriel receives records on the Kings of the Southlands and realizes that Halbrand is not who he says he is. She confronts him and he reveals himself to be the Dark Lord Sauron in disguise. He tells her that he has been telling her the truth of his intentions all along, and asks her to join him as a Dark Queen to rule Middle-earth with. Galadriel tries to kill Sauron, but he is far too powerful now. Galadriel refuses to collaborate with Sauron as she knows that Sauron only wants to rule Middle-Earth and not save it, and he almost drowns her before fleeing to Mordor. She chooses not to reveal this information to Celebrimbor and Elrond, instead encouraging them to move forward with their plan but with three objects instead of two (""one will corrupt, two will divide, but with three there is balance""). Elrond finds the lineage records and deduces what happened, but too late: three Rings of Power are forged."

Yet the news that she and Marcel had conspired to bring Michael to New Orleans back in the day didnt have the impact that Im sure the writers had hoped, and the big problem with this episode were the reactions of the characters to this newest betrayal. Sure, Klaus didnt like his dad much and would have been peeved to learn that his sister had intentionally brought his to town in the hopes of getting rid of him, but we know that its pretty standard for this family to commit such treachery on a weekly basis. We also met Michael back on The Vampire Diaries and, contrary to what were told, he wasnt so bad.

Unfortunately, thats going to be a problem for a few weeks yet, with Klaus on the warpath, Rebekah on Marcel on the run and Elijah tasked with explaining his actions to Hayley and her unborn Mikaelson offspring. The episode itself was another great example of flashbacks being made interesting and relevant to the present-day action, with Rebekah running around an abandoned hospital from her past and running into everything from influenza-riddled living corpses and creepy hallway twins, but it didnt fill in as many blanks as I had hoped going in. These guys have been alive for a long time, and Im certain heck Ive seen that theyve committed worse crimes against each other.

But, ignoring this niggle, what were left with is a fractured family of ruthless originals intent on destroying one or both of their siblings. Before Klaus had the chance to plunge the torture dagger (is anyone clear on exactly what that does?) into Rebekah, Elijah swept in like a hero, intervened and instead stabbed Klaus in the heart. Now we know that there would be no Originals without Klaus running around so, assuming its not too long before said dagger is removed, should Elijah also be running for the hills? He doesnt seem like the type, of course, and its not knowing how the three of them will now exist that made the episodes cliffhanger feel as big as it did."

Theyre interrupted by , who informs them that Davina is safe and sound in her bed. Elijah says he cant understand how Celeste figures into things.

Marcel goes into Davinas room, but she immediately lashes out at him, throwing him against the wall. Then she begins coughing up dirt (really oreo cookies!). Klaus tells Elijah and Hayley that he thinks witches are a pain in the ass!

Hayley is about to confess about Celeste when the house begins to shake. Davina is trying to rest when Rebekah enters her room to check how shes doing. Davina is confused and doesnt understand whats happening to her. Klaus asks Marcel for advice, but hes just concerned with how Davina is doing. Elijah leaves to see if he can find Sophie for help.

As Elijah leaves, Hayley stops him and confesses that she read his journals and gave the information to Sophie about where Celeste was buried. Hayley is devastated that she hid this from him, especially when she sees his hurt expression. He tells her he had made Celeste a promise that her remains would never be found, and now Hayley has made him break his promise.

In the cemetery, Sabine is doing a spell, but Sophie stops her and tells her she wants to be an elder and that shes planning on absorbing Celestes power. But Sabine is apparently Celeste and already is working on taking her power back. Elijah interrupts them and orders Sophie to go with him.

At the compound, the house shakes again because Davina has yet another spell. Sophie tells them they have to complete the Harvest now. Davinas power is tearing her apart. Klaus goes to talk with Father Kieran about the situation, while Rebekah tries to talk to Davina about completing the Harvest.

Now that the earth has shaken, the wind begins howling and blowing everything about with a vengeance. Rebekah gives Davina a shot to settle her. Marcel comes to keep watch over Davina in her room. Downstairs, Klaus and Elijah discuss killing Davina to stop the devastation. Marcel overhears and punches Klaus in the face. Klaus tells him he can have that one. He knows how much Davina means to Marcel so hes letting it go. They argue about what the best course of action is, and Klaus says hes going to make sure the city doesnt burn.

In the bar, Rebekah asks Sophie if shes ready to slit Davinas throat and finish the Harvest. She tells her yes, then Rebekah tells her that afterward she wants her to team up with her against Klaus and Marcel. In Davinas room, Marcel is torn up about what to do next, so he takes out the IV, picks her up, and leaves.

Elijah, Sophie, and Sabine are in the cemetery getting ready for the Harvest. Sabine chats with Elijah about past loves and trying to be happy. They both know what theyve lost. Rebekah calls Elijah to tell him Marcel took Davina.

While Hayley is crying and putting food in a box to take to the church, Klaus sees her and grabs a carton of food to help and they both leave for the church. Hayley seems a little surprised at the help.

Elijah and Sabine are working on a locator spell to find Davina. Sabine seems a little stressed, probably because she doesnt want to reveal what shes up to. Elijah tries to calm her down.

Marcel has taken Davina to his warehouse and tells her hes trying to save her and wants to keep her safe. Davina is still scared and doesnt want to die. Marcel assures her that shes not alone.

After Klaus and Hayley deliver the food to the church, Klaus asks Father Kieran if hes seen Marcel and Davina and tells him its important that he has to find them now. As he and Hayley leave, Klaus tells her the werewolves Father Kieran is protecting is his family, so the food will also feed them and hopefully keep them safe from whats coming. He tells Hayley she should just apologize to Elijah. Elijah is a master at forgiveness.

Back at the cemetery, Elijah and Sabine still cant locate Davina. Sophie rushes in and announces the spell isnt working because somebody has already taken Celestes magic. Gee I wonder who! Sophie asks if theres another powerful witch whose bones havent been touched that might work. He immediately thinks of his mother, Esther.

Elijah meets with Klaus and Rebekah and says he wants to use Esthers magic to finish everything. He suggests using their land to rebury her so that Sophie can take her magic. They all agree, so now they just have to rebury her and ask Father Kieran to consecrate the grave.

Rebekah goes to the garden to ask Thierry if he knows where Marcel may have taken Davina. He finally reveals that Marcel has probably taken her to the warehouse at the docks.

At the warehouse, Davina is looking bad. Marcel is trying to comfort her when Rebekah arrives. Earth and wind are finished, so now its waters turn, and Davina starts throwing it up. Now the deluge will begin. The last will be fire, which will consume everything.

Father Kieran is at Esthers grave site with Klaus, Rebekah, Elijah, and Hayley, as they stand under umbrellas with the rain pouring down on them and into the grave. Each in turn cuts their palms and lets their blood fall into the grave as Father Kieran blesses it.

Sabine and Sophie have laid out the other three dead girls in preparation for completing the Harvest once Marcel arrives with Davina. At the docks, Davina tells Marcel that its okay. Shes had a good life thanks to Marcel and doesnt want to kill anybody else. She says shes ready. He begins to cry, knowing this might really kill her for good.

The rain begins to stop and the fire begins as Marcel carries Davina to the cemetery. Sophie sanctifies the knife with fire to prepare the blade,then she slits Davinas throat as Elijah, Klaus, and Rebekah, and everybody watch. Both the rain and fire stop as Davina falls into Marcels arms. They all look devastated.

As they stand around the now four dead girls, Sophie asks for the ancestors to resurrect the girls. After three more times, she begins to plead for their resurrection, but nothing happens. Sophie is broken, thinking Davina and the other girls died for nothing. Marcel and Klaus glare at each other as everybody else cries. Marcel goes back to the compound and begins throwing things and breaking everything up.

Klaus tries to stop him and grabs him. He knows what Davina meant to him and knows how much hes hurting. He says he felt the same way when he thought Marcel had died. He apologizes that the Harvest didnt work out and hugs him as Marcel continues to cry.

As they walk home, Hayley apologizes to Elijah. He tells her just giving an apology doesnt make things that easy. He says he really loved Celeste and still does. He also tells her that it hurt him that she saw his memories of Celeste, especially since she knows that happened and that she betrayed his promise to Celeste.

Hayley starts to leave, but Elijah grabs her. They just stare at each other and almost kiss, but Elijah stops. Hayley tells him she thinks its time for him to move on, forget the dead, and return to the living (i.e., Hayley). Hurt and disappointed, Hayley walks away, leaving Elijah looking lost and alone by himself in the street.

At the compound, Klaus pours drinks for himself and Rebekah. He compliments how resourceful she was. She confesses that hes not the only one that has some spies. He admits that he doesnt always give her her dues. They discuss how they both really thought the plan of completing the Harvest would work, then they both wonder what happened to all the power that was supposed to appear. Where did it go?

Answer! Sabine, in the cemetery, completes a spell as the power courses up her arms. Shes bringing three witch ancestors back from the dead. From the other side. They casually walk down a street in the French Quarter as Sabine greets them. They greet her as Sabine. Then she tells them to call her by her real name. Celeste!

So, instead of the four girls returning, Celeste and these three witches have returned."

The Mikaelson children are still human. As a storm rages, young  tries to comfort a scared young Rebekah and gives her a carved wooden knight on a horse. He promises to stay with her. Always.

Still stuck in the City of the Dead, Klaus is after Rebekah. Elijah tells Rebekah she has to leave, then he tells Klaus he wont let him hurt their sister.

Knowing she cant get out, Rebekah calls Marcel to tell him she knows Klaus is going to kill her. Marcel tells her hes going to get her out somehow before Klaus finds a way to get to her.

Marcel tires to comfort Davina in the attic. Still upset, she tells him that when she was gone she was in a really dark, cold, place, and it went on forever.

Elijah tries to calm Klaus. With his posturing he reminds Elijah of their Father. This stops Klaus dead in his tracks.

Flashing back to when they were kids, young Elijah tries to teach young Klaus how to hunt with a bow. Theyre interrupted by Mikael when he finds them in the woods and starts slapping young Klaus around. Young Elijah tries to help his brother, but Mikael warns him to back off as he kicks young Klaus while hes down on the ground.

Elijah tries to get Klaus to prove to him that hes better than their spiteful father Mikael. Rebekah shows herself and tell Klaus that even though she may have done something bad, she did it to get back at him for the horrible things hes done to her.

Back in the French Quarter, Cami visits a tormented Davina. She tells Cami all the ancestors are mad at her because she abused her power. In Father Kierans church, he admits to Marcel that he lost his faith when Sean killed his fellow seminary students and then killed himself. He criticizes Marcel for his actions and for the Original vampires being there in control. He tells him Klaus will rip him apart, then tells him you reap what you sow.

Returning to the City of the Dead, Klaus sits atop a mausoleum, putting Rebekah on trial. Klaus says he wants to keep Rebekah safe, but Rebekah just wants to know what happened to him after all these years to make him the way he is. Elijah tries to remind him who has really stood by his side all these years.

Flashing back to childhood, Mikael beats young Klaus because he was using one of his knives to carve chess pieces. Elijah and Rebekah come to help and defend him. Rebekah threatens Mikael with a sword. It stops him beating Klaus when he takes the sword away from her and leaves.

Back in the cemetery, Klaus tells her Marcel used her. Rebekah lashes out and Klaus tries to stab her with the White Oak stake. Elijah takes the stake from Klaus, then tells Rebekah to leave them.

Cami tries to psychoanalyze Davina and tells her she has a choice. Nobody can use her if she doesnt want them to. Davina says shes confused and doesnt know who she can trust. Marcel overhears their conversation and calls Rebekah to let her know Davina wont be able to help her. Rebekah tells him to run.

Flashing back to their childhood again, theyre all happy and playing together.

Back in the present, Klaus tells Rebekah that hes convinced she always hated him, but Elijah tells him its not true. Elijah reveals that when they were younger Rebekah was going to kill Mikael while he slept in order to protect Klaus. Elijah stopped her and took her knife. He said he should have taken the chance and killed Mikael himself.

Klaus tells Elijah to stab him, but Elijah just throws the stake away, refusing to kill him. In return Klaus stabs Elijah with the same demon blade Celeste used to stab him. Now Rebekah has the White Oak stake and says that now shell decide who will live and who will die.

Klaus and Rebekah stand over the stabbed Elijah. She wants Klaus to remove the blade and tells him hes the one who is to blame for the situation theyre in. Klaus reminds her that Marcel is missing in action.

Marcel goes to ask Genevieve to help by removing the boundary spell on the City of the Dead. She tells him that it was because Davinas alliance with him that she suffered. In exchange for her help, she wants Davina.

Back in the cemetery, Klaus and Rebekah continue to argue. Klaus admits to her that hes insane, but he wants her to admit that she really wanted him dead. Finally she does. Then he stabs her with the White Oak stake. Lovingly holding her as he sticks it in.

Klaus is sitting beside her when Rebekah wakes. He says he didnt want to kill her, just wanted her to know how he felt when Mikael came after them back in 1919. Theyre both crying. Rebekah tells him because of Mikael theyre all broken.

Cami watches over Davina as she sleeps. Marcel enters and tells her hes taking Davina to the witches because the witches are the only ones who are able to help her.

Back in the City of the Dead, Klaus removes the dagger from Elijah. Klaus and Rebekah are together waiting for moonrise so they can leave. They have a long discussion. He wonders if their fathers father damaged him the way he damaged them. He tells Rebekah to leave and never come back. Klaus and Elijah will remain in New Orleans, but shes free. Shes surprised, but leaves. Shes finally gotten what she thinks she wants. Klaus looks sad and lost. Perhaps he was hoping that she would ask to stay.

After Rebekah goes to the house that burnt down, Elijah arrives, too. She asks him to leave with her, but he doesnt. She makes an apology to Elijah and tells him she thinks there may actually be some hope for Klaus after all. Rebekah kisses him on his cheek and asks him to help Klaus find his way.

As Klaus returns home, broken, Marcel is there but Klaus walks past him and walks onward up the stairs. Elijah pays more attention to him, as he throws him up against the wall then tells him hes exiled and cant come back. He tells the other vamps to run along. They all leave, including Marcel. Klaus was watching from the balcony. Nicely done, brother. Im impressed. Youre beginning to sound like me, he says.

When Rebekah goes to Marcel he tells her he doesnt want to run away. Hes not ready to leave. She tells him he can have his city. She turns to leave, but Marcel grabs and kisses her one last time as he cries. She tells him to try and stay alive.

Now that Rebekah is free, she tracks Hayley down in the bayou to let her know shes leaving and to say goodbye. She tells Hayley she thinks there might be some hope for Klaus, but also tells her she should be careful. Then, as she leaves, she tells her that she loves her little future niece very much.

After the traumatic ordeal of the City of the Dead, Klaus sits quietly and looks through a box of keepsakes he still keeps after 1000 years. He seems very sad when he sees the knight on a horse he had carved for Rebekah when they were kids and still human. Its what he was carving with Mikaels knife. As for Rebekah, she drives away in her convertible with a smile on her face. Her life finally her own."

Hayley is with her werewolves in the bayou. Their curse is broken. Father Kieran is getting worse and Cami is trying to give him some medicine. Marcel is looking out over the city that was once under his control. Genevieve, the witch that revealed Rebekahs deceit and treachery, comes to watch Klauspaint, and they get very friendly. Vampires in the city are being careless while the witches are more ruthless now that they can practice magic again.

Elijah interrupts Klaus and Genevieve and kicks her out. Hes upset because shes gotten off scott free after bringing up past issues that resulted in Klaus telling Rebekah to leave. Hes also pissed that Klaus is shirking his responsibilities as leader and just wants to paint. He tells Klaus he wants this to be their home, but Klaus is making it difficult.

Father Kieran is at the meeting Elijah is having with the vampires and witches. Elijah tells them hes in charge now and rips up the paper that had Marcels rules on it. He tells them they can all play nice or get out.

In what looks like a greenhouse with lots of plants, the four young witches that came back are doing magic. They dont seem to like Davina very much, and Monique is telling her she has to find her way back to her magic.

Back in the bayou, the werewolves are in human form again and having a pecking order fight. Oliver tries to cause trouble by telling Hayley and Jackson about the meeting Elijah was having with the vampires and witches, which obviously did not include the werewolves.

Everybody is arguing at Elijahs meeting when Hayley arrives having a tantrum about the fact that Elijah didnt include the werewolves. Elijah tries to justify the omission by telling her it was because the werewolves live in the bayou and not in the city. He tells her he wants her to return home.

Klaus and Genevieve are finishing up another romp when Cami arrives and sees whats going on. She acts a little jealous and accuses Klaus of sleeping with the enemy. She asks Klaus for help with her Uncle. Klaus breaks the news that he doesnt think theres much hope for Father Kieran. Cami storms out, mad that he cant help and maybe mad that shes not in Genevieves place.

Josh is with Davina in a cafe. Shes upset and says she feels bullied by the other witches. In the shadows, where nobody can see him, Marcel watches them.

Marcel and Thierry meet. Marcel wants him to help get the vampires together to help him take their city, their home, back. Thierry tells him its going to take more than words to take the city back this time.

Father Kieran has locked himself up in the church attic because hes feeling the urge to kill. Hes going crazy just like Sean did. He tells Cami she has to leave him, but she wont. Suddenly he lunges at her and she grabs something and knocks him out.

At the bar, Elijah is having a drink when Francesca comes to introduce herself. She tells him she wants to be allies.

Back at the compound Elijah tells Klaus, but Klaus doesnt think much of it. They decide to throw a party, the best the city has ever seen. Theyll invite werewolves, witches, vampires, and humans, too.

At the party, Klaus and Elijah toast to a boring party and then join their guests.

At the party, Francesca tells Elijah she has already settled some things. He tells her that for now hell accept her proposal. Hayley arrives and immediately catches Elijahs attention.

Josh is by himself at the cafe when Marcel sits down. He tells Josh he wants Josh to help Davina become strong so she can defend herself and be safe.

At the party things start to go crazy. Davina flirts with werewolf Oliver. Diego is antagonistic toward the werewolves and tries to start a fight, but Elijah warns him and tells him to be peaceful. Elijah tells Jackson to try to keep his werewolves from causing any problems. Genevieve tells Klaus shes a little jealous of Cami, but he tells her she doesnt have anything to worry about as far as her place in his current life. Then he notices that Jackson is going upstairs.

Upstairs, Jackson discovers Klaus studio. Klaus enters and tells him he wants to give him a gift. Jackson isnt sure what to make of this. Klaus tells Jackson he wants to make him a hybrid, but Jackson isnt sure he likes the idea. Klaus tells him he wants the werewolves to return to the Quarter to protect his and Hayleys baby. He goes to his box of keepsakes and finds the ring that belonged to his real father. He shows it to Jackson and tells him the ring will keep a werewolve from turning on the full moon.

Davina stands by herself at the party when Oliver arrives to talk to her, but witchy Monique ruins the moment.

Elijah asks Hayley for a dance. As they dance to the slow song, he tells her he hopes her baby inherits all her good looks and everything. Hayley stops dancing with Elijah and starts dancing with Jackson, who tells her that she looks beautiful.

Cami is having a drink when Marcel comes and sees that shes been hurt. She tells him shes afraid of losing her Uncle Kieran. He tells her they have that in common. Lack of family.

Diego starts goading Oliver at the party and they start fighting. Elijahs breaks the fight up, then Jackson threatens Diego with a stake. Elijah holds Oliver down, but Hayleys asks him why hes stopping, just go ahead and kill Oliver.

Hayleys emotions are going crazy. She tells Elijah to kill Oliver and starts mentioning all the stuff that everybody has been doing wrong. Elijah and Jackson release Diego and Oliver.

At the greenhouse, Josh visits Davina and tells her about his life, trying to cheer her up. He sticks up for Marcel and tells her that even though he did some things wrong, Marcel really loves her and wants to help her. Josh encourages her to try her magic again. She gives it another try and brings a rose back to life. Theyre both happy and she gives Josh the rose. Kind of like the bachelorette!

Marcel and Cami, who is pretty wasted, go back to her house. She says shes tired of being alone. They start to kiss and things progress from there. Genevieve watches them using magic and a dream catcher.

After Cami and Marcel are done. Marcel sees the dream catcher. Although Cami is happy, Marcel grabs the dream catcher and busts it up because he knows what it really is and how it can be used.

Marcel meets Thierry again and Thierry agrees to join and help Marcel.

In his studio, Klaus finishes painting a picture of nighttime on Bourbon Street and the cityscape in the back. Elijah meets with the group leaders he met with before and they all sign his treaty in their blood. Father Kieran is praying in the attic as Cami watches him. In the bayou, the werewolves are celebrating. In the greenhouse, Davina sits in the middle of all the roses that are blooming. Monique is shocked when she walks in and sees them. Theyre an indication that Davina still has more power than Monique or the other four returning witches.

Jackson tells Oliver that he had a discussion with Klaus, but Oliver doesnt believe the offer. Jackson says he wants to take Klaus up on his offer and be a hybrid.

Elijah joins Klaus and Klaus signs the treaty, too. Klaus finishes his painting by painting a full moon in the middle, right over Bourbon Street."

But he really shoved Cami as she tries to give him some water. Cami and Josh try to talk him down, but he grabs Josh, thinking hes Sean, and tells him there are monsters in the city. Trust me, I know, says Josh. Cami thinks she might have a way to save Uncle Kieran.

 looks for the grimoire, but Elijah hid it from naughty little fingers! Klaus tells him he thought he would be happy that hes trying to help the wolves, since helping them also helps Hayley and the baby, but it doesnt move him to give him the grimoire. At least not yet!

Cami talks to Marcel, who offers his help, but she turns him down. Josh arrives with a doctor, who doesnt look too happy when he sees the condition Father Kieran is in. Marcel call Klaus and asks him to help Cami. Meanwhile, Josh is compelling the doctor to help Father Kieran and forget all the talk about vampires and stuff. Cami tells the doctor she wants to use shock treatment to help reboot her Uncles brain.

Eve is helping Hayley with her breathing exercises in the bayou house. Hayley is more concerned about being a mom rather than the pain of labor. Elijah comes to talk to her and she finds out that Jackson is making a deal with Klaus about the moonlight rings. Oliver tells her and Elijah things are under control. Then they hear a motorcycle roaring up.

The guy wants to talk to the leader. Elijah senses the explosive on the bike and grabs the guy right as it explodes. Everybody is knocked to the ground from the explosion. A child stands over her father, writhing in pain. Hayley hands her to Jackson and she kneels down with Elijah to examine the mans wound. Turns out the explosives had wolfsbane. Hayley goes to another downed member and puts a tourniquet on her leg to stop the bleeding until she can heal herself.

Hayley, thinking the attack was from Marcel, grabs a stake and goes off to find him.

Back in the church attic, Cami is getting ready to put the electrodes to Father Kierans temples when Klaus arrives. Cami isnt exactly sure whether to be happy or mad. She tells him shes going to do it whether Klaus thinks she should or not.

Hayleys Mustang hurtles to find Marcel. She calls Elijah and tells him that shell be back. Elijah sees the other bombs around the camp and tells everything to take cover, but the warning is too late and bodies fly everywhere.

In the attic, the shock seems to have helped Father Kieran for a few seconds. Klaus asks to have a word with Cami. In the church he tells her things arent going to end well, but she doesnt want to give up on her Uncle. Hes all she has.

Back out in the bayou, bodies are hurt, dying, or dead, everywhere. Eve is trapped under a camper and Elijah lifts it so she can get out. She never triggered the werewolf gene, so she doesnt turn and she also cant heal herself.

Hayley storms into the bar brandishing her stake and confronts Diego, demanding to know where Marcel is hiding. Diego gives the address.

In the attic, Father Kieran has an outburst and tries to attack the doctor, but hes shackled to the chair. He gets his left arm free and bites off his thumb. Yuck!

Hayley phones Klaus to tell him whats been going on. Klaus is upset and tells her she needs to keep out of trouble. She lies and tells him that shes with Elijah.

Jackson, Elijah, and Oliver are with Eve. Elijah wants to give her some of his blood to try and heal her.

Hayley gets to Marcels, and he denies any involvement in the bombing. He says the guy on the motorcycle had gambling debts at the human casino, so the humans may be behind the attack. She asks him if he killer her parents. He offers her money to leave and tells her that her parents died from in-fighting among the wolves. He rescued her as a baby from her crib and took her to Father Kieran. Marcel tells her she can leave New Orleans and start over somewhere else, but she tells him that this is her home. She leaves and doesnt take the money.

Father Kieran lies in bed near death. Klaus plunges his hand into his check to stimulate his heart, but he tells Cami her Uncle doesnt have long to live. She asks him to turn her Uncle. Reluctantly, Klaus gives him some of his blood. Father Kierans heart stops and he dies. Now the transition will begin.

In the church, Cami tells Klaus shes worried how Father Kieran will react when he realizes hes a vampire. Klaus tells her he has to leave, but she asks him if he will stay awhile longer and he agrees.

Eve wakes up and Oliver tells her she should complete the curse so shell heal. Then he confesses to what he did. He was the one responsible for the explosion. She tells him theyll kill him if they find out what he did. Oliver picks up a pillow and smothers Eve. Now nobody will find out.

Father Kieran is giving Cami some of his books and tells her she has to leave. He cant find the key that he kept around his neck, so he tells her she has to find it. They hug and he kisses her, and he says not to look back as she leaves him. Tears stream down her face as she leaves.

Hayley, Jackson, and Elijah are with Eves dead body as they hear Oliver riling up the werewolves outside, making a play to dethrone Jackason as Alpha so he can take his place and also to get rid of Hayley. Elijah tells her trouble is coming.

Father Kieran, in his priestly robes, prays. Klaus goes to Genevieve and asks if she and the witches were responsible for the attack on the wolves. She asks if he thinks shes really that kind of a monster. Then she realizes that he does. She says it wasnt her, and the hex will return even if Father Kieran finishes his transition into a vampire.

True to her word, the hex returns to Father Kierans hand as his hallucinations begin again. The witch that hexed him tells him he has to complete the curse. He grabs a knife and puts it to his throat to slit his throat, but she tells him he has to complete it by making a sacrifice. He has to kill Cami. Father Kieran, no longer locked in the attic by a boundary spell, steps over the threshhold of the room, a crazy glint in his eyes as he heads for Cami.

Cami lights a candle and cries as Father Kieran comes up behind her to kill her. She jumps off the balcony, the same place where Klaus threw Tim from, as Father Kieran comes after her. He comes down to the church as Cami tries to get away, but he flings her into a pew, then grabs her by the hair and raises the knife. Klaus grabs him and snaps his neck, then cradles him in his arms. You deserve better than this, he says as he stakes Father Kieran. Now he is finally at peace. Klaus tells Cami it was never about keeping Father Kieran alive. It was always about giving Cami time to say goodbye.

Klaus calls Marcel and pardons him long enough to come and help bury Father Kieran. He also wants him to come back and comfort Cami, telling him that when she woke up she called his name. If only she had called Klaus name. Anyway, Marcel comes and embraces Cami as she cries for her now dead Uncle.

In the bayou, Hayley watches Oliver creating a frenzy among the wolves.

In the bar, Marcel asks if Josh was able to get the key from around Father Kierans neck. Josh hands him the key. He wanted it to help keep Cami safe. Shes not ready for what will come next.

The chief evidence of this: Mikael, the Original patriarch, is finally an active participant in the shows proceedings. Hes had some important flashback scenes with major revelations earlier in the season, but hasnt been an active participant yet. But thanks to something going on in Mystic Falls involving PurgatoryI havent been keeping up with The Vampire Diaries but it sounds like its Bonnies faultMikael can influence the present, disorienting Klaus and Elijah, attempting to kill Hayley, and convincing Davina to resurrect him.

The idea of generational conflict pervades A Closer Walk With Thee, well beyond Mikael. At almost every turn, the older characters attempt to deal with younger ones, and the elder characters are far more interesting. So, after Mikael appears in a dream, we immediately see the witches talking. Genevieve is delivering exposition, but Horrible Monique starts sneering and criticizing. It takes some doing to turn Genevieve into the more sympathetic character, but having Monique be as antagonistic as she is to everyone does the trick.

A far better form of the generational divide occurs shortly after, at the wake for Father Kieran (a convenient title!). Klaus, the youngest sibling, is petulantly nursing his drink when Elijah, the eldest sibling, comes along. And Elijah is on fire in this scene: Far better than your process of grief, Niklaus. Denial, rage, and hoarding coffins in basements.

This is followed by a confrontation between Cami and Francesca, the casino owner who now runs the Human Faction. Francesca doesnt have many scenes in this episode, but she controls each of them. Actress Peta Sergeant is clearly reveling in playing the sort of forthright, dominant character who can take over a scene by motioning for a drink, or raising an eyebrow at a rival. Shes older than Cami and Hayley, those rivals in this episodes scenes, and that gives her power that she may not physically possess as a mere human.

Hayley, meanwhile, finds herself trapped by paternalism. Klaus keeps on demanding her presence in the Original household after the terrorist attack, and Hayley rejects the idea. But after confronting Francesca, and after being stricken by Monique, and after fighting with Mikael, Hayley returns to Klaus control. I understand the narrative value of such a movehave your main characters near each otherbut the question of how much agency Hayley actually that has plagued the series for so long, and seemed at least partially resolved, now rears its ugly head again. Is she actually a character, or is she a vessel for the baby and a love interest for Elijah?

Meanwhile, the episode is also fraught with paternalism from the Cami/Marcel pairing. This isnt a quality issueboth actors and character read as roughly the same agebut its got power and mythological age issues. Marcel, the centuries-old, powerful vampire, wants to help Cami but cant help but use his knowledge, in order to attempt to manipulate her. But she knows it, and initially rejects, then attempts to embrace on her own terms.

But the main motivator of A Closer Walk With Thee remains the Original patriarch. Mikaels background has hung over this series since its beginning, and his presence has grown increasingly important since the major flashbacks at the heart of the Rebekah arc.The Originals simply has to confront who Mikael is and what he means to the series concept. Based on the events of this episode, it knows this, and is working directly toward it (possibly with Mikaels resurrection in the season finale?) Based on Sebastian Roches sheer presence, this will be a very welcome change indeed. Between Mikael, Elijah, and Francesca, this was a great episode for the elder generation."

Klaus vows to find their child and then you can tell your niece how much you cared for her mother when we save her, he replies.

But its Marcel who actually rescues the baby from the witches, killing Monique with a dark object/star that unleashes a thousand cuts on its victim.

Shell get a white fence. Itll be lovely, says Rebekah, making a welcome return. And how lovely is that, in turn, Rebekah gets her dream of a family and a normal life (granted by way of a twisted mess and her brothers misery)? Its all kind of perfect that the little girl will be with her auntie.

There is no one I would trust more with my daughters life, Klaus tells his sis. Be happy. And for his little girl: You will return to me.

Whats her name, Rebekah wonders. Her name is Hope, replies a teary-eyed Klaus. Of course it is.

* Cliffhanger: Esther is back as the fourth Harvest girl?! As is Mikael, thanks to Davinas magic, but shes no fool. Shes got control over him so she can get payback against Klaus when she wants and not a moment sooner.

* Klaus breaks up with Cami as friends, citing his need to ruin everything he finds beautiful. And you are beautiful, he tells her.
