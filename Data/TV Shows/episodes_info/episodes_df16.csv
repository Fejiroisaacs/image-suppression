She's been asleep for two hours and getting texts about Faye and Eben. Grant offers to take her away from everything and she loves the idea, just not right now.

Faye gets roughed up by the witch hunters on the ferry.

Back at the house, they suggest calling Blackwell. Diana is against it, but they think they need help. Sam only had one demon in him and they couldn't stop him; Eben has six.

Eben calls on Faye's phone. He tells Cassie to bring one crystal to the boat. Adam is all for it. But they wonder if Blackwell was telling the truth about the skull being the only way to kill Eben, since he wants one so they can't form it.

Cassie and Diana would have to be there to put it together because of their Balcoin blood.

Adam wants a back-up plan. Cassie suggests they figure out how to deal with Blackwell after Faye is safe.

Dawn goes to Charles. He tells her about reliving what he did to Amelia when he killed her. She tells him about Blackwell wanting to destroy him; he knows it worked because he confessed to Diana.

They think they have to get their powers back to help the circle and there's only one person who can make that happen.

Cassie and Diana find Blackwell while the others go to the ferry where their parents died.

Blackwell tells them to create the skull they have to destroy each crystal and let them reform. When they do that, their powers won't be connected to the crystals or each other. ""Which means your circle will be unbound,"" he says.

Diana doesn't want to unbind the circle without talking with the others. But Cassie says they don't have a choice if they want to save Faye.

Blackwell gets started, lighting the crystals. He tells Diana and Cassie to each take two. They toss them into the lake and wait for the skull to come to them.

At the ferry, Jake wants to charge in. They all feel a pang in their chest. Jake wants to see if Faye is OK, but Adam stops him with magic. He realizes it's solo magic and the circle is unbound.

On the boat, Faye discovers her magic works and gets free. She beats up on a witch hunter to get her phone.

Charles' mother arrives at his house.

Faye calls her mom. She tells her mom she knows she's a witch, but Dawn already knows. She tells her mom where she is but that she can't get out because there are witch hunters everywhere.

Charles' mom tells him their power was destroyed when they stripped it and it can't be restored, so instead she's going to give them hers.

The water starts bubbling in the lake and Cassie feels the skull forming. She walks in and gets it from the roiling, frothy water.

Blackwell shouts at her to pick it up while it's still forming. She picks it up and gets a charge from it. She carries it out and says the power is amazing.

Diana puts her hands on it and Blackwell tells them whatever happens, don't remove their hands. The big blob shrinks down into a crystal skull.

Melissa, Adam and Jake can't reach Cassie and wonder what's going on. Adam goes for Cassie and Diana.

Blackwell takes the skull from Cassie, she wants to know why she can't hold it. She's mesmerized by it and takes it back from Blackwell. She asks why she can't be the one to use it on Eben. Diana votes for that plan. Blackwell knocks them out and takes the skull.

Charles' mom finishes turning over her powers. Charles asks her for her help.

Jake and Melissa sneak onto the ferry. They find Faye but Eben finds them. He paralyzes them. ""Time to die,"" he says.

Cassie and Diana wake up in the abandoned house. They try to sneak off but they're trapped in a force field. Blackwell says he needs them there and tells them everything he's doing is so they can be the witches they were meant to be.

Eben has Faye, Melissa and Jake tied to a pole. He lights a fire in a circle around them. It quickly spreads. Charles and Dawn arrive.

They see Eben watching the kids in the fire. Charles tells Dawn he'll handle Eben. Charles starts reciting something that brings Eben to his knees and forces the demons out.

Dawn puts out the fire with magic and frees the kids. Charles keeps chanting and lets the demons crawl into him.

Jake splits off to go after Eben. Eben tells Charles it isn't over. ""It is for you,"" Jake says. He stabs him, for his parents and Nick. He looks up and Charles is gone.

Back at the house, Cassie realizes Blackwell never planned on killing Eben. He sent their parents off to the ferry 16 years ago so the circle would be easy-to-manipulate orphans.

Dawn, Melissa and Faye see Charles on the ferry deck. She sees the demons in him and asks what he's done. He manages to tell her to tell Diana he loves her, then he pitches over the side of the ferry into the water.

In the house, John recites a spell. Cassie asks what his plan is if he's not using the skull on witch hunters. ""To kill witches, every single one without Balcoin blood,"" he says as he reveals the Balcoin emblem on his palm.

On the ferry, the women feel a burning inside.

Adam comes to the house, also feeling the pain, in time to hear Blackwell say he wants to get rid of weak witches and gather the other Balcoin children -- four in other towns, raised in other circles. They're coming to join Cassie and Diana. He calls them the purest race.

""We'll destroy the witch hunters once and for all. We can change the world, as a family,"" he says.

Adam slowly moves the table with the skull toward him with magic as Blackwell's back is turned, but he's weak. Blackwell sees him and throws him across the room. They see Adam is burning.

Cassie tries to use her dark magic to break free, but she's not strong enough. She tells Diana she needs her power. Diana sinks to her knees as Cassie chokes her to death. It ignites Diana's dark magic and the force field is broken. Cassie grabs the skull and tries to reverse his spell. She's not strong enough on her own, but Diana joins her and using the skull they take on Blackwell.

They're stronger than he is. He sinks to his knees and starts to turn to ash, protesting that they're the same blood. They kill him.

The circle comes to Cassie's house.

She tells them she should have known Blackwell was up to no good and is sorrier than they'll ever know. They can't destroy the skull, so they suggest putting it in a lead box and dumping it in the ocean. They nominate Adam the reliable one for the job.

They debate binding the circle again. People only started coming after them when they bound it. Faye says they're connected even if they're not bound.

Cassie reminds them other Balcoins are coming and binding their circle is their best protection. Diana, who hasn't said anything yet, says she's leaving town and can't bind the circle.

Cassie pleads with her to stay, but Diana wants to get away from everything. Cassie commends Charles for saving them all, but Diana says he also did some terrible things. But with Charles gone, she has nothing left. And after feeling her dark magic when Cassie activated it, she never wants to feel it again. Diana leaves.

Jake offers to take Faye home, but she plays hard to get, saying she has plans. He kisses her.

Diana meets up with Grant at the coffee shop with her bags.

Melissa comes home to find Faye prepping for a big night out. It's Sunday night, but they have solo magic and can make their own fun.

At his place, Jake finds a note from his grandfather, saying the circles are coming together and the fight is far from over. There's a small vial of granules with it.

Charles sits in a chair as his mother makes a mark on his arm. Reliable Adam tries out the crystal skull and likes the rush. Driving off with Grant, Diana sees that she has the Balcoin mark on her palm. At home alone, Cassie lights fires with hers.

Four teenagers with Balcoin marks on their palms look out over Chance Harbor."

As the customers complain, the train continues speeding and the driver announces that they've lost their brakes because the computer system is out.

Batwoman speeds to the train's next stop on a new bike, and Lucius tells her what is happening with the train. It passes her on a track and Batwoman speeds after it, snaring the rear with a line on her bike. She then stops the bike and fires another line, stopping the train just before it hits the collision barrier. The hook gives out and a man tackles Batwoman, knocking her out of the way. People take photos of Batwoman and the policeman, Slam Bradley, together.

The next morning, Vesper is talking about Batwoman and Slam together and wonders if they're shipping them. Lucius tells Kate that her street credit is off the charts, and Slam is a hunk on the GCPD calendar. Kate points out that she's gay and it's her birthday, and Lucius tells her that her new ""relationship"" isn't entirely negative. He says that people just want to see Batwoman happy, and Kate tells him that she isn't. As Kate leaves, Lucius discovers that she's reading an article about Jacob's upcoming trial.

Alice has tea at Catherine's gravestone with Mouse, and says that Kate didn't join them. Mouse points out that Kate ignored her messages, and suggests that they celebrate later. Alice is happy that Catherine is dead, and Mouse tells her that the two of them Kate will never be a family. When Alice says that she killed their mutual enemy, Mouse tells her that it's a weakness, not a gesture of affection to Kate. Mouse says that Kate sees a soul worth saving when she looks at Alice, and isn't going to sip tea with fugitives. As long as Kate wears her mask, Alice will never bring Kate into their family.

At the clinic, Mary blogs about how she's human garbage because Jacob is a murdered and Catherine's company is corrupt. She signs off and tells everyone to be better, and Kate comes in. Mary isn't thrilled that Alice poisoned Catherine, and tells Kate that she, Sophie, and Jacob have already put together a strike team to bring in Alice. When Mary reveals that Alice desecrated Catherine's grave, Kate is shocked and apologizes to Mary. Mary says that Kate ignored her when she said Alice was dangerous, and tells Kate to leave.

Lucius and Kate check out the train, and Lucius says that the black box shows no indication of hacking. Kate turns off the lights and finds an electronic device. Lucius concludes that it's packet analyzer that the hacker used to override the train computer. The hacker calls everyone in town on their phones, and says that if people don't pay him $5 million via crowdfunding, he will reveal everyone's secrets. The hacker, Terrier, hints that he knows Batwoman's secret identity.

The mayor soon gives a press conference talking about the press conference. He insists that they have layers of cyber security in place, and Kate and Lucius watch from the Batcave as Terrier access the TV broadcast and gives everyone the mayor's credit card number. Lucius shuts down the Batcave computers, warning that Kate's identity is in danger. She suggests that he trace the IP address, and figures they have to turn on the computer so Lucius can trace Terrier Kate does it anyway and Lucius tells her that they'll go dark in five minutes before going to work.

In prison, Jacob is eating by himself. A prisoner sits down next to him and asks where his ""bite"" is, and welcomes Jacob ""home"". Jacob gives the prisoner his food and walks off. When Jacob calls Mary, she says that they got his trial moved up to after Valentine's day. Mary is trying to find a doctor who will testify that face-swapping is possible. Mary tells her to stop and asks how she's dealing with Catherine's death. He suggests that Mary talk to someone, and insists that he never stopped being Mary's dad despite his issues with Catherine. Mary isn't interested and tells him to sit tight while she finds someone to help him.

That night, Lucius traces the hacking device and Batwoman goes to the warehouse. The comms are dead, and Batwoman finds Sophie and her Crow officers interrogating the hackers. The head hacker insists that they're not terrorists, but Sophie doesn't believe him. When the hacker says that it wasn't them, Sophie punches him and walks off.

When Sophie goes outside, she hears Batwoman grapple down. Batwoman asks Sophie if she wants to talk about it, and Sophie finally says that her husband left her because he thinks she's lying to herself. When Batwoman asks if she is, Sophie admits that she might be and suggests she's too terrified to deal with it. Batwoman suggests that Sophie take off her mask, and Sophie says that she's one to talk.

Mary approaches Dr. Campbell as he leaves his college lecture, and asks him if he'd be an expert in Jacob's trial. She says that Jacob was set up by a man who used a mask made out of human skin, and Campbell is an expert on the topic. Campbell insists that it isn't possible, and suggests that Mary was under e4xtreme duress and imagined what she thinks she saw. With that, Campbell leaves.

When Kate returns to the Batcave, she complains that Luke shut off the comms. He tells her that he did to protect them against Terrier, and Kate wonders if she's a fraud. She feels like she's lying to the entire city because she wears a mask and pretends to be involved with a man. Lucius points out that the citizens think Kate is a hero and she is, and gives her an electric charge disruptor that will kill every electrical current within 100 meters for ten seconds. Lucius figures that if Terrier's phone is proof against the device, Kate can use the disruptor and then they can track the only active phone. He has done a reverse audio modulation and discovered that she's a young girl. When Kate has Lucius lower the tone, they hear a bell in the background and she recognizes it: Gotham Prep: Kate's old high school.

Mary calls Sophie and tells her what Campbell said. Sophie suggests that Mary talk to Kate, and promises that they'll find someone who can help Jacob. Mary is at Gotham University and Alice walks by, and Alice goes after her. Sophie tells her to get out and she's sending a team, but Mary hangs up and follows Alice.

Batwoman drops into a Gotham Prep dance and loudly asks who Terrier is. One student takes a selfie with Batwoman and other students crowd her. Batwoman activates the disruptor and all of the phones and lights shut down. As the kids boos, Batwoman uses special contact lenses to spot one girl leaving with an active phone, and follows her into the restroom.

The girl, Parker Torres, says that she's just a kid at a dancer. Batwoman plays back Terrier's recording as Terrier, and Parker says that she wasn't going to crash the train. She was on the train controlling it from her phone and was going to stop it, but Batwoman stopped it first. Parker says that it was a prank, and she thought if she could scare her parents, they'd stop thinking of her as a freak. She explains that she's gay, and her ex Kayla Mason outed Parker to her parents. Parker couldn't tell the truth so Kayla told Parker's parents for her. Parker needed the money to get out. Batwoman says that it's not an excuse to endanger hundreds of lives, but Parker says that her parents hate her and so does she. Parker figures that Batwoman was the hottest school when she was in high school, and they have nothing in common. She tells Batwoman to leave her alone and walks out, and Batwoman looks at herself in the mirror.

Sophie and her men arrive at Gotham U and go to the room Mary saw Alice go into. They break into the dorm room and find a male student there.

Alice approaches Parker, who recognizes the villainess. As Alice says that she knows Parker is Terrier, Batwoman arrive and attacks Alice. Alice knocks her out with a trophy then knocks down Parker as she runs and says that she needs her.

When Alice takes Parker to the shop room, she ties her up and threatens her with a powered saw. She says that Parker's roommates tagged Batwoman. Batwoman comes in and Alice says that she needs Batwoman to figure out she's not a human. Alice insists that Parker is an important tool in her plan, and she'll tell Batwoman once she takes off her mask.

Mary is at the clinic packing up her things when Sophie comes in. When she wonders what's going on, Mary says that there's no point being a doctor if she can't save her mother. Sophie says that Alice wasn't at Gotham University and suggests that Mary hallucinated her because her world fell apart. She talks about how her marriage blew up and she'd rather do anything than feel their feelings. Mary insists that she's not imagining things, and Sophie tells her that finding Alice won't bring Catherine back.

Alice tells Batwoman that she's obsessed with saving people who don't want to be saved. Batwoman tells Alice that she's sick and prepares to cut Parker open. Kate removes her mask and Parker stares at her in shock, recognizing her. She apologizes for being a bitch to Kate earlier when she said she couldn't understand being gay. Alice interrupts , saying that she needs Parker to out Kate as Batwoman. She insists that no one is going to change who she is. Parker asks what Alice will do if she refuses, and Alice finally says that she will blow up Gotham Prep with the C4 that she planted at the dance and she's holding the detonator.

Parker refuses to out Kate, but Kate tells her to do it. The student says that if Batwoman goes away, Gotham's hope goes with it. Kate tells her to tell everyone and gives Parker her phone, and Parker agrees. She finally says that she did it, and cell phones ring throughout the city broadcasting that Kate is Batwoman.

At the Crows HQ, Sophie gets the message and tells a team to go with her to Gotham Prep.

When Alice sees the message, she frees Parker. Kate tells Parker to go, then punches Alice, handcuffs her to a railing, and asks how to disarm the bomb. Alice insists that she fixed Kate's life, and she's already punished Jacob and Catherine. Kate tells her to take all of her ""gifts"" back, and Alice asks Kate to be her sister. Her sister says that Beth died and the world would be better if she stayed dead. When Alice tries to touch Kate's face, Kate grabs it and police sirens approach. Kate says that Parker sent a message to the Crows saying Alice is at Gotham Prep.

Sophie and her men arrive and establish a perimeter, Slam arrives and orders everyone to go out while he enters the gym.

Alice reveals that the detonator she's holding isn't the real one.

Mouse is in a nearby car and blows up the school. Everyone gets out and stares at the burning wreckage in shock. Batwoman managed to get Slam out, and the crowd chant at them to kiss. When Slam tries, Batwoman shoves him back and says it isn't happening.

The next day, Parker visits Wayne Tower and asks where her Batbike is. Kate tells Parker that she'll be doing community service scrubbing graffiti because of what she did, and is going to play back the blackmail money. Parker assures Kate she won't reveal her secret, and Kate figures that she won't and dismisses her. As Parker goes, Kate tells her that eventually Parker will stop hating herself. She says that she's there if Parker wants to talk about what she's going through. Parker says that she's glad that Batwoman is someone like him.

The mayor hands Alice over to the Crows. Sophie visits Alice in a Crows interrogation room and says that she's not going anywhere until she reveals where Mouse is. Alice just laughs.

Lucius meets Kate in the Batcave and gives her a birthday cupcake, and she asks him not cut her off on the comms again. Kate blows out the candle on the cupcake and Lucius leaves.

Vesper is son announcing that Batwoman is a lesbian because of what happened with Slam, and wonders when they stopped letting their politics.

Sophie reads the article.

Parker reads the article and smiles.

Mary calls Campbell and tells him that she's not crazy. Kate visits her and after a moment, Mary cries and hugs her.

Later, Kate calls Jacob. Jacob says that the two of them will need each other more than ever, and wishes Kate a happy birthday. When Kate enters her office, she finds Alice waiting for her. Alice has brunette hair and apparently doesn't remember anything she did as Alice. Kate grabs her and yanks at her face to discover if she's wearing a mask, and Alice insists that she's Beth."

Sophie calls Jacob in prison and says that Beth is back, and he warns her that whatever happened in the house erased all traces of Beth, leaving only Alice. Sophie figures that they should interrogate Alice in the hopes that she'll incriminate herself, but Jacob warns that it's too big a risk to let Alice into Sophie's head. As Sophie hangs up, Kate comes in and says that Alice escaped. Sophie tells her that they have Alice imprisoned, and says that Mary saw her as well.

Kate and Mary meet with Alice, who has checked the fingerprints on the messenger bag Beth left behind and confirmed that they match Alice's. There's an ID of Alice in the bag, and Mary has checked an astronomy thesis that Beth wrote. Luke says that she can crack Beth's phone in a couple of hours, but Kate enters the password Beth always used and it works. There are pictures of Beth and Kate together, and Mary notes that they seemed really closed. Kate refuses to tell Jacob about Beth apparently having returned, and Mary goes to check with the astrophysics department to see if anyone has heard of Beth.

Once they're alone, Kate suggests to Luke that Alice came from a parallel Earth after Crisis. Luke suggests there was no crash on that Earth, and Beth was spared of everything that happened to Alice. Luke figures that Beth is scared to find herself on a different world, and Kate figures Beth is where they always went on their birthday.

Kate takes her motorbike to the playground and finds Beth sitting on the swing set. She says that she apologizes and tells Beth that she didn't recognize her before.

She explains that Kate still feels like the best friend in her life, and her Kate pulled her from the car that went off the bridge. Beth says that Kate has been her ever since.

Kate says that she's going to rescue the two sons anyway, and then tells Luke that it wasn't true that she could have saved Alice. Luke tells her that Kate has Beth back and Beth doesn't need saving.

Mouse points out that Kate was happy living her life without Alice and now it's time for Alice to live her life without Kate. He asks Beth if she was followed, and asks if there are lions or tigers around. Beth doesn't recognize the code, pulls off Alice's wig, and asks who she is.

When Mouse locks Beth in a car trunk, Kate breaks free and attacks him and the gangers. Mouse recovers, lights a lighter, and tosses it on the car.

Sophie tells Alice that it's her last chance to be the person she once was. Alice remembers her past.

------

Alice washes the blood off of her hands, and Johnny thanks her for making him look normal. He gives her some fishing line and says that they can fix her book together. Alice stares at the book and then says that she's going to call Johnny ""Mouse"" and he can call her Alice, and they can have a tea party. The two of them sit together to have tea together and Alice starts stitching together the book.

-----

Sophie figures that Alice escaped her past by building a new world, and Alice asks her if she escaped her reality by lying to herself and everyone else about who she really is. After a moment, Sophie tells the guards to take Alice to Arkham, and Alice insists that she is now who she really is. Once Alice is gone, Sophie picks up Alice's book and the pages fall out.

In the corridor, Alice uses the fishing line from the book to strangle her two guards. She grabs one of the guns and shoots them dead. The alarms go off and Sophie comes out, and Alice puts her gun to her head. After Sophie drops her gun, Alice tells her that Sophie is still trapped in her cage and always will be because it's one of her own making, and walks off.

Kate manages to pry the doors open and gets Steven and Bryan out. She then goes to get Beth out of the trunk of the burning car, but is unable to free her. Beth look sat her for a moment, and then Kate pries the metal supports apart and gets Beth out just before flames consume the car.

Vesper soon announces that Alice is back on the streets and the GCPD refuses to call Batwoman.

Sophie coordinates the Crows' search for Alice, and receives a report that Mouse is out of surgery. Kate arrives and Sophie tells her that she's rattled and pissed. Sophie says that she remember everything and wishes her a happy birthday, and Kate says that she did. On the news, reporters are at the GCPD demanding that they turn on the Batsignal. Sophie admits that sometimes the city surprises them and Kate smiles.

Batwoman arrives on the roof of the GCPD and the crowd cheers her.

Sophie visits Jacob and apologizes for not taking his advice. He says that Alice killed the agents, and figures that now Alice is a fugitive, they can shoot her without repercussions.

Kate returns to the bar and Luke, Mary, and Beth wish her a happy birthday and throw her a surprise party. Mary says that now she sees what Kate loss, and says that she read Beth's thesis and thinks that Beth being there is a cosmic anomaly. She suggests that there might be multiple earths and while they were destroyed, some parts were left over... like Beth. The group sings ""Happy Birthday"" to Kate and Beth tells her to make a wish. Kate says that she only wanted a second chance and now she has Beth, and has Beth make a wish for her. After a moment, Beth clutches at her head in pain.

In an alleyway, Alice collapses, moaning in pain."

August insists that it's not possible. When Sophie points out that they have Mouse in custody, August asks to meet with Mouse and, once he confirms it, he'll sign an affidavit. Once August leaves, Sophie tells Jacob that they need him back at Crows HQ. Jacob says that she has to eliminate the threat at any cost to prove she's a force to be reckoned with.

Back at Crows HQ, Sophie tells her men to find Alice. They spread out through the city searching Alice, while Sophie orders a B-42 as Acting Commander of the Crows. She tells her men that if they see Alice, they should shoot to kill.

Mary and Luke drive Beth out of town, and Mary notices that Beth's ear is bleeding. They come to a crow Checkpoint and Mary fakes an asthma attack so Luke can talk them past the checkpoint. Beth hides beneath a blanket, and Luke stops at the checkpoint. The Crows come over and Mary tells them her father is Jacob. Meanwhile, Beth winces at the pain in her head but moans in pain. The Crows order Mary and Luke out, and spot Beth in the back. Batwoman arrives and takes out the Crows using the weapons on her cycle, and yells at Luke and Mary to go.

The next day, Vesper announces that Crows agents stopped her searching for ""Alice"", and complains about the police state.

The Crows continue their search, and Alice throws a knife into one Crow's throat. She clutches at her head in pain, at the same time that in the Wayne Tower office, Beth has the same pain and Mary discovers that her cells are disintegrating on a molecular level. Beth suggests that in her research, she's theorized that Earth-Prime isn't big enough for both her and Alice. Their bodies will disintegrate until both of them die. Mary figures that Alice and Beth have seven hours to live.

Kate pours Alice a drink and Mary says that they need to get Alice to a hospital. Luke warns that the crows will kill her, and Kate tells them to put their heads together and think of something. She then goes to meet with Sophie to convince her to let them pat the checkpoints. Luke talks to Kate privately and warns that Sophie won't believe any story Kate tells her, and Kate leaves.

The disguised Alice sneaks into a hospital HQ and coughs up blood. She then tells a guard that she has orders to transport the inmate, goes into Mouse's room, and says that she comes to get him out. He assumes that she's Beth until Beth finishes their shared knowledge of Alice in Wonderland. Mouse explains that a woman that was Alice tricked him, and Alice realizes that her pain is because of Beth. Her ears bleed, and Alice tells Mouse not to worry about her. She has some digging to do to find answers, and then she'll come back for him.

That night, Sophie goes out in the field and searches with her Crows. Once she's alone, Batwoman arrives and reminds her of probable cause. Sophie says that it's on her to find Alice, and Batwoman suggests that she call off the shoot-to-kill order. She asks if Sophie wants to start her command roughing up innocents, and warns that half the city thinks Sophie is on a power trip. Batwoman suggests that April have the C4rows stand down while she finds Alice, and reminds her that she once said she trusted her. Sophie tells her that she can't and walks away, and Batwoman slips away.

Dodgson confronts Jacob in the prison bathroom and stabs him with a shiv.

Luke and Beth try to come up with a way to save Beth. Beth says that they have to kill Alice but Kate won't consider it. Alice comes in, and she and Beth stare at each other in shock. Alice insists that Beth isn't her. Beth explains about Crisis, and Kate arrives. Alice complains that Kate didn't tell her about Beth, and Beth says that she understands why Alice understands her. Kate tells Alice that Kate saved her from the car crash in her universe, and Alice tells Kate that she never imagined her life would be so ""basic"" if Kate saved her. Beth says that they're an anomaly, and Alice comes to the same conclusion that Beth did: one of them has to die so the other can live.

Alice pulls out a knife and throws it at Beth, and Kane catches it. Alice and Beth both suffer from migraines, and Alice starts to go. Kate starts go after her but Luke says Beth needs her.

Dodgson continues attacking Jacob, throwing him against the wall. Jacob fights back and the two men struggle. Dodgson shoves Jacob's head in a toilet and throws him into a mirror, and says that Jacob had his men tampered with evidence and killed good people. Reggie Harris comes up and chokes Dodgson unconscious, and tells Jacob that he's one his way out and he'll need Jacob to return the favor of saving him.

Back at her clinic, Mary tries to find a cure for Beth. Alice staggers in and asks Mary for help. She points out that Mary isn't allowed to discriminate saving people, and reminds her that she saved her life when she gave her the antidote to the poison. Alice tells Mary that people underestimate her but she's very useful. She then knocks Mary unconscious.

August goes to the hospital and meets with Mouse. He says that that he's Mouse's father. August confirms that he's Mouse's father and explains that his purpose is to shield his son from ridicule and help him find love. He claims that his son betrayed him and removes his mask, revealing that he's Ethan, and explains that he faked his death and took on the life he deserved as August. However, August lost Mouse in the process because of Alice. August asks where Alice is so that he can forgive him for being a weak little boy who didn't realize Alice was taking advantage of him. Mouse insists that Alice was his family because she accepted all of him, while August raised him to believe he was too repulsive for the world to see.

Mouse insists that he will never betray Alice, and August takes a syringe out of his bag and injects Mouse with it so he doesn't have a choice.

Alice extracts blood from Mary. Mary wakes up, tackles Alice, knocking the syringe out of her hand, and the two women fight. She manacles Alice to a pillar using Alice's own chains, and Alice begs her as family that the blood will keep her alive. Mary refuses to give her the syringe with the blood, and Alice grabs a nearby phone, calls the Crows, and says that she knows where the person they're looking for is hiding.

At the office, Kate tends to Beth and tells her that Mary is coming with a cure. Beth asks her what's the deal with Luke, and Kate claims that she's hallucinating. When Beth asks Kate while she's still single, Kate avoids answering and Bate says that she always wanted the soul mate that Kate had. Before Kate can respond, the Crows arrive and call on ""Alice"" to surrender. Sophie is there with her men and they go in.

Kate realizes that Alice tipped off the Crows. Luke comes in and warns that the Crows are coming and Kate tells him to get Alice to the Batcaver. They take her through the secret passage to the elevator and descend to the Batcave, just as Sophie and her men break into the office and find no one.

Alice hallucinates Mary as Catherine, and accuses her of slithering into her family. When Catherine says that Alice never showed remorse, Alice insists that Kate will pick her rather than Beth. ""Catherine"" tells her that if Kate chooses otherwise, she'll save Alice a seat in Hell.

Beth wonders why Kate risk her life to save strangers, and Kate says that failing to save her mother and sister makes her try to save everyone's mothers and sisters. Beth tells her that it's courage, not guilt. Luke arrives and says that they're going to have to wait the Crows out, but Kate says that they can't wait. Mary calls Kate and they meet outside, and Mary explains that the antidote Alice is in her blood and will cure Beth. Kate hesitates to condemn Alice death, and Mary tells her that Kate has to choose between saving Beth or the woman who killed her mother.

Kate goes to the clinic where Mary told her Alice is. She explains that she knew Mary's blood is the cure to curing Alice, and Alice tells her that she knew Kate would choose her.

-----

Earlier, Kate talks to Beth privately in the Batcaver. Beth knows about the blood cure from Luke, and says that after spending time with Alice, she understands her Kate admits that she did nothing to save Alice, and she's not about do nothing again.

-----

Alice tells Kate there there's no time to wait. Kate takes her hand and says that she came to say goodbye. Alice stares at Kate in shock and cries.

Back at the Batcave, Kate injects Beth with the cure. Beth tells Kate that she's always been a hero. Luke arrives and says that he can't get past the checkpoints, and Kate tells him to take the Batbike. Beth recovers and Kate says that the fact she's alive is all that matters. Luke takes Beth with him.

-----

Alice says that Kate doesn't know Beth, and Kate tells her that all she can hope is that Alice finds peace. Her sister asks Kate to stay with her, and Kate says she's there.

-----

Luke drives through the streets with Beth, and breaks through one of the Crows' checkpoints. They call in the sighting, and Mouse wakes up to find himself tied to a chair in a warehouse as August listens to the radio. August says that he'll be back for Mouse soon and leaves, and Mouse screams in rage.

Luke drives up to a waiting car.

Kate holds Alice and cries.

Sophie draws a bead on Beth with a sniper rifle, but then calls in and asks for backup from the Crows. A shot rings out and Beth collapses in Luke's arms. August picks up his sniper rifle and leaves.

She shoves him on his back and straddles him, then bares her fangs and bites into his neck. Paralyzed, the man says that he'll give her anything.

Later, the woman hangs the man up from the ceiling. As she reads a magazine, blood drains out of him from the tubes she inserted into him.

At the tower, Kate, Luke, and Mary consider Beth's death and wonder who did it. Mary figures that Alice will be looking for revenge because Kate was willing to let her die, and they figure they have to find Beth's killer since the Crows believe Alice is dead since they have Beth's body. Kate warns that they have to brace themselves for the consequences of Alice still being alive.

Jacob is exonerated once he proved that the Wonderland Gang framed him. He tells a reporter that he and the Crows will restore peace to Gotham, and Gotham is safe because Alice is dead and that's all that matters. Jacob then goes to the morgue with Sophie, and the coroner pulls out Beth's body. Sophie asks the coroner to give them a moment, and once he leaves Jacob looks mournfully at his ""daughter"". He tells Sophie that all he feels is hollow, and asks what happened. Sophie remembers talking to Batwoman, and says that she didn't have a lock. Jacob covers over Beth with a cloth.

In her lair, Alice wonders where Mouse is when he was supposed to meet her there. Her gang members arrive and say that the only thing left in Mouse's hospital room was a stuffed animal.

Luke gives Kate a necklace that he took off Beth after she was shot. He says that he run the shooter's partial plate and didn't get a match, and figures it was stolen. Luke tells Kate that he's putting out flyers on the car, and there are plenty of other crimes for Batwoman to deal with. He gives her a newspaper article on ""Nocturna"", who has claimed her second victim. Luke figures Kate could use the distraction dealing with a vampire wannabe, and figures that since Crows are securing the bars where Nocturna picked up her victims, they should patrol the only other bar near them: The Catch. Kate suggests an upscale bar, Curse, and goes to the Batcave to suit up.

That night, Batwoman spots a victim in a lab. Nocturna confronts Batwoman and attacks her, and Nocturna manages to bite Batwoman on the neck. The venom in her saliva knocks Batwoman out, and she ties Batwoman up and leaves as the heroine wakes up. Luke calls Batwoman and says that Nocturna injected her with a paralytic and there are six Crows incoming. He hits Batwoman with an adrenaline shot and warns it will take 30 seconds to kick in.

Sophie gets to Batwoman first, and Batwoman tells her to save the strung-up victim because she's unconscious but still alive. Instead of going over, Sophie frees Batwoman first and Batwoman thanks her. Sophie warns Batwoman that the next time she'll have to bring her in and says that there can't be a next time. Batwoman says that she understands, and escapes as the other Crows arrive. Sophie tells them to see to the victim, and turns to discover that Batwoman is gone.

Later at Mary's clinic, Mary tells Kate that she's happy to run her blood but she doesn't have the flu. Kate fakes a cough, and Mary suggests that the flu-like symptoms are a manifestation of her guilt for choosing Beth over Alice. Her stepsister says that Beth deserved to live and there isn't a minute when she doesn't remember that. The results come back and Mary tells Kate that she has ketamine in her blood. Kate dismisses it as a result of her partying and leaves.

At the Batcave, Luke tells Kate that Nocturna injected her with an animal tranquilizer. Kate explains that it was a bite, but Luke doesn't want to hear it. He scans the suit with UV light but doesn't find any traces of Nocturna. Kate suggests that they target party-goers since that is who Nocturna goes after.

Jacob tells the Crows that they have to re-earn the city's trust, and now they have competition. He insists that gaining adulation is now how protecting a city works, and now they have to find Nocturna before Batwoman does to remind people what real authority looks like. Afterward, Sophie congratulates Jacob. He says that Mary is posting about the grand opening of Kate's bar, The Hold Up, and he thought that was several weeks off. Sophie realizes that Jacob wants her to go there and keep an eye out for Nocturna.

That night at the club, Mary arrives and takes selfies. Luke spots her on the surveillance cameras and notifies Kate. He spots Sophie, and Mary goes over and congratulates Sophie on her dress. Sophie claims that she's just blending in for work, and Mary leads her off. Kate goes to the bar, and Luke spots a woman, Elle, and runs her through facial recognition.

Mary gets Sophie a drink, and Sophie insists she's working. She says that needs to find Nocturna and tells her that she drugged Batwoman the previous night. Sophie admits that she freed Batwoman before the Crows found her, and Elle cuts between them. Mary motions at Sophie to approach Elle, and Elle apologizes and flirts with Sophie. Mary quickly excuses herself, and Elle makes conversation with Sophie.

Kate moves through the crowd and Luke tells her that he's identified Elle and she works in veterinary medicine. He points out that Elle is all over Sophie.

At the Crows HQ, Jacob is going over a file on Alice. A Crow tells him that he has footage from the warehouse and Jacob needs to see it. Jacob takes the tablet and looks at the footage in shock.

Kate goes back to Luke and tells him that Sophie is just working Elle to figure out if she's Nocturna. Luke suggests that Kate figure out who Elle is, and he teases Kate about how Sophie is flirting with Elle. Meanwhile, Elle talks about how the Crows user to protect her family when she was a kid, but she figured she'd rather cheer Batwoman than the Crows if she's going to recognize someone who skirts the law. As Sophie talks about Batwoman's costume, Kate serves them drinks on the house. Mary sees Kate squaring off with Elle but can't make it over.

Sophie claims that she and Kate have first met, and Kate ""accidentally"" cuts herself while slicing a lime. Elle gets nauseous at the sight of blood and asks for some water. Jacob texts Sophie to come to his office ASAP, and she leaves.

Luke listens to Mary talk with one of her online followers, and comes out and claims that he's Mary's date. Once the follower leaves, Kate calls Luke on his hidden earpiece and says that Elle isn't Nocturna. Mary picks up on it and wonders why he's talking to Kate when he's her assistant. Luke goes to the surveillance room where Kate has spotted Alice outside the club. She tells Luke not to call the GCPD, insisting that she's got it.

When Kate arrives, Alice asks her where Mouse is. Kate wants to talk about what happened, and Alice points out that Kate let her die. She figures that she means nothing to Kate, and Kate tells her that she has a second chance because the Crows think she died. Alice tells her that she chose a complete stranger over her, and Kate insists that Beth was a kind compassionate version of Alice: a version of Alice she thought Alice could be. Alice points out that Beth died despite everything Kate did to keep her alive, and hopes that Beth was worth it to Kate. Luke watches on the surveillance cameras as Alice walks away when she hears police sirens approaching.

Alice returns to her lair and is furious with herself that she let Kate into her head. She talks to a mannequin that she's disfigured like Mouse, and says that she let Kate distract her from the real Mouse. Alice admits that she failed to win Kate back and Kate let her die. Nocturna comes up behind Alice and bites her.

Kate and Luke try to figure out what partygoer might be Nocturna. Luke asks if they're going to talk about Alice, and admits that he called the police. Kate admits that whatever hope she had for Alice is gone, and then notices a masked woman on the surveillance footage, following Alice. Luke identifies her as Natalia Knight, whose father died of a heart attack two weeks ago... when the killings started. Natalia was born with a disease that causes her to burn in sunlight, and her kidneys have trouble cleaning her blood. Kate figures that Natalia's father was her caretaker, and when he died she was left to her own devices.

Nocturna strings Alice up, and Alice says that she doesn't want anyone to know she's alive. She suggests that Nocturna let her go once she gets her fill, and Nocturna says that her ""fill"" is every drop of Alice's blood. Alice warns that she's making a big mistake, and offers her special blood. Nocturna admits that she's intrigued and Alice smiles.

Sophie meets Jacob in his office, and he asks if she's working with Batwoman. She insists that she's a Crow.

Luke tracks Alice, and Batwoman runs into the lair and frees the hung-up Alice. Alice says that she doesn't know where Nocturna is.

Mary leaves the club and spots an apparently-drunk woman in the alleyway. Nocturna comes up behind Mary and bites her.

Kate frees Alice and explains that Nocturna injected her with ketamine. She identifies the ropes that Nocturna used on Alice as bell ropes, and has Luke identify which church they belong to since each church has unique colors. Luke confirms that the ropes belong to the church where Natalia's father worked, Gotham Cathedral, while Kate realized that Nocturna spared Alice. Alice tells Kate that she's sorry her being alive disappoints Kate, but Kate figures that she's hiding something. When Kate figures that Alice should be dead, Alice says that Kate did everything in her power to make sure of that. Luke calls to confirm that Gotham Cathedral is abandoned.

Batwoman drives to the cathedral and goes in, and finds Mary strung up, her blood drained. Nocturna attacks Batwoman and they fight. The villainess tries to bite Batwoman, and Alice arrives and hits Nocturna with a pipe before she can succeed. As Alice helps Batwoman up, Nocturna escapes. They go to Mary and Alice says that she'll donate blood to her while Batwoman captures Nocturna. Batwoman hesitates and Alice points out that she doesn't have a choice.

Nocturna flees upward into the bell tower and Batwoman goes after her. They fight and Nocturna talks about how her victims pollute their blood and she never had a chance. Batwoman knocks the blood bags out of Nocturna's hands and they fall to the floor far below. When Nocturna grabs Batwoman, Batwoman shines Luke's UV projector in her face, burning her. Batwoman then handcuffs Nocturna to a bell and leaves.

After seeing Jacob's footage, Sophie admits to him that she let Batwoman go. Jacob is furious at the position Sophie put him in. Sophie's phone rings and Jacob tells her to answer it. It's Kate, who tells her where Nocturna is. Sophie hangs up and tells Jacob that they can use the help, and points out that the Crows practically turned Gotham into a police state to find Alice. Jacob tells her that he no longer trusts his second-in-command and tells her to decide whose team she's on: his or Batwoman's. Until then, Sophie is suspended.

The next day, Kate visits Mary at her clinic to confirm she's okay. Mary doesn't remember anything after Nocturna drained her blood, until Batwoman brought her there and gave her cookies to renew her blood sugar. She says that Nocturna says that the desert rose antidote in her blood could cure Nocturna's condition, but Mary confirmed via blood tests that there was no trace in it. Kate realizes that someone who knew about Mary's blood told Nocturna about it, and leaves.

Kate goes to Alice's lair and asks her how Nocturna knew about the desert rose. Alice points out that Mary is alive because she saved her, and admits that she sent Nocturna after Mary. Kate refuses to feel guilty and says that she never will, but Alice doesn't believe her. Unimpressed, Kate tells Alice that she's a vampire feeding off of her guilt, and asks Alice what her end-game is. Alice says that she set out to prove Kate was stupid for letting her die, and Kate tells her she was stupid for thinking her sister was redeemable, and that she could be worth saving. As Kate starts to leave, Alice suggests that maybe she doesn't want Kate to give up on her.

A ganger tells Alice that Campbell visited Mouse at the hospital. He has a file on Campbell ready for Alice, and Alice discovers that Campbell took a sabbatical six years ago. When he returned, Campbell divorced his wife and specialized in facial reconstruction of burn victims. She figures that Campbell is August.

Vesper reports on the radio that Nocturna is going to Arkham thanks to the Crows. When she mentions that Nocturna injected ketamine into her victims, Mary remembers that Kate had ketamine in her blood and puts the other clues together. She looks at a CatCo magazine cover with Batwoman and realizes that she's Kate.

Sophie lights the Bat Signal and Batwoman arrives. The Crow says that Jacob knows they've been working together and working with the organization is her dream job. She refuses to throw everything away, and Batwoman says that she gets it. As she goes, Sophie kisses her and after a moment, Batwoman kisses her back."

A lawyer, Bobby Reeves meets with Jacob and says that the DA reopened several old cases, and put a new Judge, Davis Wellington, on them. Wellington has had a contract with the Crows dating back to 2004. Reeves' client wants Jacob to influence Wellington to get his case moved up. When Jacob refuses, Reeves says that his client is Reggie and Jacob owes him his life. Jacob remembers Reggie saving his life in prison, and points out that Reggie confessed to gunning down Lucius Fox, Luke's father.

The surgically-masked woman draws a knife and approaches Kimberly, who runs. Kimberly comes to an exit but discovers that it's locked, and hides. However, the intruder finds her and puts a razor to her face.

The next day, Luke comes in and asks Kate about her ""date"" with Sophie. She briefly describes it, then quickly switches the topic to the two models that were cut on their faces.

A ganger grabs Mary and drags her the rest of the way in, and Alice points out that she saved Mary's life after Nocturna's attack and now Mary owes her. She says that she did it mostly because of Batwoman, not Mary, and as she goes Mary asks her if she knows Batwoman's secret identity. Alice says that she does and suggests that since Mary doesn't know, Mary and Batwoman aren't friends after all.

At the factory, Duela suspends Veronica over a vat of chemicals and says that she's doing her a favor Duela says that she was finally happy, and Veronica points out that happy people don't slice their faces open. Her captor insists that the only difference between them is that she got institutionalized and Veronica got famous.

One Week Later

In a police car, Officer Wilcox is dozing and wakes up when a call comes in on the police radio. He looks down and finds a bomb strapped to his chest. Wilcox finds a tape recorder taped to his hand and hits Play. A voice tells him that he has a bomb strapped to his chest and tells Wilcox that he can disarm it if he presses a yellow button. The button will set off another bomb in Gotham, killing hundreds of people. The voice asks Wilcox if he's a hero and says that a hero would do anything for his city. After a few seconds, Wilcox presses the yellow button and across town, a bomb goes off.

The next day on the radio, Vesper announces that the Detonator is back and he's out to prove there are no heroes in Gotham. She says that Wilcox blew up a bank to save his life,

EMTs take Batwoman to Mary's clinic, and Batwoman says that she was helping a man out of the bank wreckage when the ceiling collapsed. Mary checks Batwoman's broken ribs and removes her mask, revealing that it's Julia. When Mary asks why Julia is pretending to be Batwoman, Julia explains that the real one is MIA and Gotham needs a superhero. Julia wonders if Mary knows where Batwoman is, and Mary says that Batwoman doesn't confide in her.

Later, Julia comes to Kate's house and finds her passed out on the couch. she gives Kate something for her hangover, and Julia points out that Kate hasn't responded to her texts. Kate vaguely thanks Julia for being there for her, and Julia says that Gotham feels ghosted by Batwoman. She asks what's going on, and Kate worries that she might screw up and kill someone else's life. Julia tells Kate to get over it, and Kate isn't impressed. Julia says that someone blew up Gotham international Bank the previous night, and they're both needed there.

At Asylum, Mouse tells his therapy group about how his father had him hide his face. When he realized he was doing it for his father's comfort, he was free. Alice is sitting next to him and asks what he's doing, and Mouse says that he's unburdening himself. Alice reminds him that they're trapped because of her sister, and Mouse says that it's a sanctuary where Safiyah can't find Alice and they have each other. Butler asks Alice if she wants to share, and Alice passes.

Tommy comes in late and starts talking about Bruce. Alice notices that Tommy has a knife hidden in his shoe, and Butler tells Tommy that they need to move onto topics. Tommy points out all of the other ""crazy"" patients, and says that he's the guy who taught Bruce everything he knows. The orderlies drag Tommy away as he rants and the other patients go berserk. Alice says that she can't live like herself.

On TV, attorney Bobby Reeves tells reporter that he'll get justice for Reggie. The Detonator is watching in his basement lair, and preparing more bombs,

Julia goes to Sophie's apartment, where Sophie is putting up photos of Fisher, the man who killed Reggie, and tried to kill Sophie and Jacob. She has already confirmed that someone paid Fisher through the Gotham International Bank. Julia tells her that the bank was blown up and they wonder if the person responsible was trying to cover up the killer. She starts going to work on the computer trying to find the name of the killer.

Kate finds Luke punching a bag in the Batcave. She suggests that talking about Reggie being killed in front of Luke might be something to do. Luke refuses and points out that Kate hasn't been active in a week, and Kate says that's why she's there and asks what Luke has on the Detonator.

Jacob tells his agents that seven years ago, the Detonator crippled Gotham with fear. He compelled heroes to kill people to show they weren't heroes.

Luke tells Kate that the bad guys are getting comfortable and came out once she disappeared. He then shows Kate Bruce's research on the Detonator, Bruce was obsessed with bringing the Detonator to justice.

Jacob tells his people that the signature of the bomb used at the bank matches the ones used seven years ago, and had the number 214 printed on it. The signature was never released, so Robles figures that the Detonator is responsible.

Of the suspects, one, George Adler, has military experience as a private military contractor. He was caught taking selfies with enemy corpses and received a dishonorable discharge, and Kate knows that 214 is a military discharge code like the one she got when she was discharged. She goes to talk to Adler, and Luke tells her that he's put bomb-proof armor on the Batwoman suit. Kate freezes up then tells Luke that she's going as her, not Batwoman. Luke figures she hasn't been out looking for Cartwright, and says that he should know what's going on with her. Kate says that if she told Luke the truth, he wouldn't want her to suit up.

The orderlies take Alice back to her cell, and she goes past Tommy coming the other way. She says that he's a Bruce Wayne wannabe, and she tells Tommy that he'll never be Bruce Wayne. Tommy stabs her with his knife and the Alice yells that she needs a doctor. One takes her to the asylum's med ward.

Kate goes to Adler's apartment and claims that she's buying the building as a real estate developer. She finds a newspaper with a headline about the detonator, punches Adler, and asks where he planted the next bomb. Adler says that the Detonator is his father, George Adler Jr. He says that his father snapped and died seven years ago.

Reeves wakes up in his car beneath an underpass. He hits the tape player, and the Detonator tells him that now he has a choice to be a hero.

After she recovers, Alice goes to the main ward where Mouse is sitting. She says that she's okay and Mouse tells her that they put Tommy in solitary. Alice removes the stitches from her cut and takes out a knife that she hid.

Reeves calls Jacob, who figures the bomb is within a mile of Reeves so the attorney can hear the explosion.

Kate calls Luke and says that it must be a copycat, and Adler Jr.'s alibi checks out. Luke gets a report on Reeves and tells Kate, and they realize that Mary's clinic is nearby. Meanwhile, the Crows evacuate the area. Julia is at the clinic as Mary evacuates her patients. When Julia says that the clinic is secret and the Crows can't evacuate it because they don't know about it. Julia refuses to leave her remaining patients.

Jacob and his men go to Reeves' car, and Reeves says that he can't do it. Jacob assures him that he'll do the right thing.

Mary puts a mattress over one of her patients as protect6ion. Julia comes back and Mary tells her to put the patients on the floor, cover them with mattresses, and hope the building has earthquake protection. Kate runs in, calling to Mary.

Jacob receives a report that the GCPD have cleared the area. He tells Reeves that he can push the yellow button, and Reeves does. An explosion goes off near the clinic, throwing Kate back before she can get to Mary's clinic.

As the GPC patrol the street, informing everyone via lockdown that Gotham is under lockdown, Kate wakes up and goes into the clinic. She help Mary move a cabinet off the costumed Julia, and tells Kate that Julia is Batwoman. Kate looks around and says that she has to go, and staggers out into the hallway. Mary goes after Kate and says that Kate inspired people and now they feel abandoned. She admits that she knows Kate is Batwoman, and says that Batwoman is the same person she's look up to. Now Gotham needs Batwoman as much as Mary does. Kate says that it isn't that simple, and Mary tell her she doesn't get a sick day and she's just asking her to keep going.

Butler prepares Mouse for electroshock, who says that he had another moment of clarify. He knows out Butler's assistant and then stabs Butler in the chest with the knife Alice gave him, and says that's Butler's reality, now.

Julia and Sophie tell Luke that they tracked the killer to the same address that the Detonator blew up. In the last week, everyone with knowledge of Lucas' murder has been killed. They figure the person claiming to be the Detonator is the killer, and blew up anything that could lead anyone to him. Luke points out that they're dealing with a copycat, and they work out that Robles was a rookie cop on the Detonator investigation seven years ago. Robles is now head of the Crows' homicide division, and Luke points out that Robles was also the first one to arrive at Lucas' murder scene.

In the Crows' HQ, Robles knocks out Jacob, puts a bag over his head, and takes him way.

Kate paces the Batcave and remembers what Alice and Mary told her. She finally puts on the Batwoman costume.

Jacob wakes up in his office and finds a bomb taped to his chest. He turns on the tape player taped to his hand, and Robles tells him that Jacob should have seen it coming.

Luke radios Batwoman and tells him what he and the others found out, and that Robles is taking a motorcycle out of town. Batwoman moves on him and Robles shoots at her. She fires a grappling line, yanking him off of his motorcycle, then goes over and Robles says that he's a Crow and going to destroy her. Batwoman points out the people he's killer and kicks him down, and asks if he killed Lucius. Robles says that no one will be able to prove it, and admits that he ties up loose ends as Luke listens in over the comm.

A truck with the explosives is parked in the garage beneath Wayne Tower.

Sophie and Julia find Jacob, with the bomb counting down from five minutes. Meanwhile, Batwoman takes Robles to the bomb after he gives up its location, and Robles says that he can't disarm the bomb unless the other one goes off, and it's with Jacob.

Sophie tells Jacob that Robles is the killer. Batwoman radios Julia to tell her that where the main bomb is, and tells her not to have anyone touch the yellow button on Jacob's bomb. Jacob tells Julia to call Kate to have her stay away from Wayne Tower. Sophie warns that she can't disarm the bomb, and Jacob tells her not to try until they evacuate the area around Wayne Tower.

Luke approaches the truck with a gun and tells Batwoman that he needs Robles alive. He tells Robles to get up, and Luke activates shutters sealing off the bomb. He explains that Lucius planned for that, and asks Robles if he wants to die a coward. Luke also tells Batwoman not to try and disarm him, because she's not fast enough. Robles says that Tommy hired him to kill Bruce, and Lucius was writing a book. He shot Lucius when Lucius charged at him, after he said that he'd hurt Luke is Lucius didn't give Tommy what he wanted. After that, he framed Reggie and spent the last four years covering the murder up. Luke pistol-whips Robles unconscious.

Jacob tells Sophie that it's all his fault, and Gotham is on lockdown because of him. Sophie assures him that it isn't his fault, and Julia comes back and says that they're still evacuating the area around Wayne Towers and she's not leaving despite Sophie's insistence. Sophie refuses to leave Jacob, and Julia says that they're stuck with each other.

Batwoman tells Luke to go so she can give Jacob the greenlight to disarm the bomb on him. She hesitates and then rips off her mask. Luke aims his gun at Robles, saying that Robles took everything. Kate tells her friend that killing Robles won't bring Lucius back. Luke isn't impressed, and Kate tells him that she killed Cartwright and didn't suit up because she feels like a fraud. She tells Luke not to let his anger turn him into someone he's not. The detonator on the bomb ticks down, and Kate and Luke carry Robles out while Kate tells Julia over the comms to hit the yellow button. They get Robles out of the parking garage just in time as the bomb on the truck blows up.

The next day, Jacob reinstates Sophie and says that he's overhauling the Crows based on the names that Robles gave up if everyone involved. He says that Sophie will lead the new strike team to take out the moles, and Julia comes back in and says that she's been recruited to work with Sophie. Jacob leaves and Julia asks Sophie where she starts. Sophie says that they'll start with good burgers.

Kate is reading an online article about Batwoman being back. Luke comes in and says that the bomb squad has cleaned up the garage, and thanks her for talking him off the ledge. Kate wonders what Lucius' journal was, and Luke says that it was a manual for building every piece of WayneTech technology. Luke asks why she didn't tell him about Cartwright, and she says that she didn't want to see the disappointment on Luke's face. Luke says that Joker hasn't been in Arkham for the last five years ago and implies that Bruce killed him, and asks how long Kate is going to let her guilt on killing a man drag her down.

Before Kate can respond, Mary comes in and congratulates Kate on Batwoman's return. Luke insists that Kate isn't Batwoman, and Kate tells him that Mary knows. Shocked, Luke insists that they're not playing a game, and Kate leaves him and Mary alone to work it out.

Mouse, disguised as Butler, goes to Alice and tells her that it's time for her therapy. She realizes that Mouse is disguised as Butler, and Mouse suggests that they get ice cream before they leave. Alice tells him that she's considered what he said earlier, and figures that they can be royalty and will wait until they're ready to remind everyone of who they are. Mouse walks off, and Alice waves to him as he goes."
