Immediately hanging up her cellphone, she crosses the busy traffic to intervene and sees a man in a long black cape running from the scene. Vicki gives chase, but the man disappears after he turns into a dead-end alcove. When Vicki's ex-partner, Detective Mike Celluci [Dylan Neal], and his new partner Dave Graham [Keith Dallas] show up, they find that the victim's neck has been torn open and the body drained of blood. The next day, news of the ""Vampire Killer"" makes headlines in the Toronto Sun, and Vicki is visited by Coreen Fennel [Gina Holden], the gothy girlfriend of the victim. Coreen was on the phone with Ian when he was attacked, and Coreen wants Vicki's help finding the killer, whom she believes to be a real vampire. Vicki isn't convinced, but when Coreen tells her about the man in the long black cape, Vicki decides there might be more to this murder than meets the eye and decides to investigate further.

That night, Vicki returns to the alley to look for clues. She finds a pentagram on the wall and takes a sample of some substance she thinks might be blood. Suddenly, she notices a young man also looking around, but when she tries to talk with him, he disappears. Next stop is the morgue, where coroner Rajani Mohadevan [Nimet Kanji] has concluded that the wounds on Ian's throat were made by razorsharp teeth. She also tests the substance Vicki brought in and concludes that, indeed, it is blood. Dr Mohadevan agrees to compare the blood sample against Ian's blood to see if they match. That night, Vicki gets a call from Mike. He's learned that Vicki visited Dr Mohadevan and wants to trade information with Vicki. Mike reveals that he thinks the killer may have gotten his unusual strength from drugs, maybe crystal meth or PCP, and that the wounds might have been made by a glove with razors attached to the fingers, Freddie Krueger-style. He also thinks that the blood might have been harvested for a cult ritual. In return, Vicki reveals that her client is Ian Reddick's girlfriend who believes Ian was killed by a real vampire. After Mike calls the idea ""ridiculous,"" Vicki agrees that it's unbelievable, but she still wants to check out Club Nervosa, the bar where Ian worked.

Meanwhile, vampire Henry Fitzroy [Kyle Schmid] hasn't been sleeping either. He has learned from a cute waitress that Ian used to work at Club Nervosa. The club is really hopping when Henry gets there. He recognizes Vicki (from last night in the alley) and tries using his power of persuasion to get her to reveal why she is at the club, but it doesn't seem to work on Vicki. So, Henry asks around for information about Ian and learns that he had trouble with a few of the other regulars. While Vicki goes over the same ground with the bartender, Henry links up with the regulars by offering them money. They go outside to talk, and Henry quickly detects that they had nothing to do with Ian's murder or with the ""evil behind it."" However, the regulars decide that they want more money for their info and gang up on Henry. Henry easily knocks them to the ground just as Vicki comes out of the bar. Vicki watches as Henry leaps to a roof.

The next day, Vicki returns to the morgue to see what Dr Mohadevan has learned about the blood sample. Turns out to be Ian's blood, but she has also discovered in her lab tests that there is saliva around the bite marks on Ian's neck and that the saliva doesn't match any known species, human or animal. In addition, she found a substance under the fingernails of another of the vampire killer's victims. The substance is similar to batwings, she tells Vicki, but not the wings of any known species of bat. What is going on, Vicki wonders. Count Dracula on a bender? Dr Mohadevan reminds Vicki to keep an open mind as there are more things out there that aren't dreamt about in a police training manual.

What IS going on is that ubergeek Norman Bridewell [Michael Eklund] has succeeded in summoning a demon who is providing him with money, fancy clothes, and a Porsche but demands blood in return. So far, he has taken three victims, including Ian. Norman's fondest wish, however, is to make the cute goth chick who works at the University Pub, Coreen Ferrel, fall in love with him. Unfortunately, the demon does not have the power to control love, but he promises Norman that only two more victims are needed to unleash a more powerful demon who does have the power to give Norman everything he desires. Norman has already picked out his next victim, a pretty blonde who spurned his advances, and informs the demon that she will be in a nearby park that very night.

Meanwhile, Vicki has charted the locations of the murders on a city map and noticed that they are beginning to take the shape of the pentagram that she found on the alley wall. Deducing that the next murder is going to be committed in a nearby park, she hurries over. Henry has also hit upon the pentagram shape of the murders and hurries over to the same park. The blonde is walking through the park when she is attacked by the demon. Henry leaps in to save the girl. The demon recognizes Henry and announces that his master will soon be coming for Henry. The demon then turns into a cloud of bats and flies away. Suddenly, Vicki jumps in and finds Henry leaning over the girl's body. She goes after Henry, but Henry knocks her out just as the police arrive. Afraid of being detected, Henry grabs Vicki's limp body and carries it off with him. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0967594/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"Vicki learns the truth about Henry, and their lives get more dangerous as Norman escalates his requests.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Allan Kroeker'],"['', '']",[],['black bra'],[],"NOTE: Continuation of Blood Price: Part One.

Vicki awakens to find herself lying on a sofa in Henry's living room. At first, she fears that Henry is the killer. Henry admits that he is a vampire and demonstrates it by running a knife through his palm and showing his fangs, but he tells her that the killer is actually a demon who is being summoned by a human, and he would like to team with Vicki, since Henry cannot work during the daytime. Vicki agrees, and asks Henry how he knows so much about demons. Henry explains how, in 1890s London, he came upon a Satanic cult called Hellfire. Their leader had summoned a demon named Astaroth from whom they requested eternal life. In return, they offered ""the nightwalker"" Henry to Astaroth. Astaroth asked Henry to open the portal that would let him pass into this world, but Henry refused and sent Astaroth back to hell. Henry is certain that the demon who has been killing people in Toronto is attempting to open that portal. If that happens and Astaroth enters this world, all hell will break loose, Henry tells Vicki.

Since dawn is approaching and he must sleep, Henry suggests that Vicki search the police files for a rash of thefts, as minor demons can only gift their summoners with material goods that they steal from someone else. Vicki jaunts over to the police station and requests the reports from recent thefts. She finds several, all concentrated in the university area. Still too big an area, Henry says when Vicki later shows him her findings. Instead, Henry performs a ritual that reveals the demon will strike again in Bikeman's Park.

Once night has settled on the city, Vicki and Henry go walking in Bikeman's Park. Suddenly, they hear a scream. The demon has taken one victim and is turning on another. Henry and Vicki jump in and fight him until the demon gives up, turns into a horde of bats, and flies away. Unfortunately, Henry has been stabbed several times and needs blood. Vicki rolls up her sleeve and offers him her arm. Henry drinks just enough to keep from dying. Vicki escorts him back to his condo where she spends the day tending to him while he sleeps. By that evening, Henry is healed, so they meet with Dr Betty Sagara [Linda Sorensen] , a professor of Demonology at the university and one of the few individuals who knows about Henry. Dr Sagara gives them a list of students who have recently shown an overinterest in demonology.

The next day, Vicki starts looking up the people on the list. Meanwhile, Norman has enticed Coreen to his house by telling her that he knows how to find the vampire that killed Ian. Before she goes off with Norman, Coreen leaves a message on Vicki's cellphone about meeting Norman. When Coreen gets in the Porsche, however, Norman chloroforms her, takes her to his apartment, and ties her up. When Vicki hears Coreen's message on her cell, she notices that one of the people on Sagara's list is named Norman Bridewell. It gives the address, so she calls Henry to tell him where she is going. She asks Henry to hurry over as soon as he wakes up. Then she heads over to Norman's house where she finds Coreen gagged and tied to a chair. Norman suddenly leaps from a closet and knocks Vicki out. As he ties Vicki up, Norman says to Coreen, ""I think we have our next sacrifice.""

When Vicki finally comes to, Norman has summoned the demon. When Norman offers Vicki as a sacrifice, the demon disappears and Astaroth takes his place. Just as Norman is about to stab Vicki, Henry flies in the door and starts reciting the incantation that will force Astaroth back to hell. Astaroth screams ""No!"", takes Norman instead, and promises Henry that he will be back for him. Mike rushes in just in time to see Astaroth disappear. As Vicki, Henry, and Coreen file out the door, Mike stands dumbfounded.

Epilogue: Coreen promises not to breathe a word about Henry and applies for a job as Vicki's office assistant. Vicki has somehow had black pentagrams burned into her wrists. Henry thanks her for assisting him, and they vow to keep in touch, since it looks like Astaroth has them both marked. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0885600/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,Vicki gets caught up in voodoo when she tries to locate her client's brother.,[],TV-14,Release date,['James Dunnison'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Vicki Nelson has just met with a potential client at the Juju Lounge. Angelique Jerroux wants help locating her brother Royale. After the floods following hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Royale fell in with someone named Henri Gregoire and went missing. After discussing particulars, Vicki and Angelique walk out to their cars, accompanied by Angelique's buff friend Jean-Marc. Suddenly, they are attacked by a lumbering, gray-skinned, nonbreathing hulk of a man with glazed-over eyes and no pupils. Vicki tells Angelique to run, then she tries to fight off the attacker. The next thing Vicki knows is that Jean-Marc is dead and her ex-partner Mike Celluci is on the scene sizing up the murder. Of course, Mike can't buy Vicki's description of the attacker.

It was a zombie, explains Henry Fitzroy, when Vicki later asks for his help. The trick will be to locate whomever created the zombie and break the connection, Henry advises. He also warns her that it will be dangerous, having himself had some doings with Haitian voodoo in the past. First on the to-do list is to talk with Angelique. Henry and Vicki return to the Juju Lounge to see if the bartender knows where to find her but he won't talk, so they wait outside and follow him when he goes running to Angelique. He leads them to an abandoned warehouse where they are surprised to see Angelique mumbling jumbo in front of a candlelit voodoo altar. Angelique admits to being a Voodoo Mambo (high priestess), she and her brother having followed in their parents' footsteps after they were both murdered by practitioners of Dark Voodoo.

Vicki suggests that Angelique come stay at her office where she will be safer. Coreen is excited to meet a real Mambo and agrees to keep Angelique company while Vicki and Henry go in search of Gregoire. They return to the Juju Lounge where they find the bartender has been murdered. In the poolroom, they see the zombie getting up from the floor. Henry tries to fight him, but the zombie is virtually unstoppable until Vicki runs a poker through his chest and nails him to the wall. The next morning, Vicki goes down to the TPD (Toronto Police Department) and learns from Mike that Gregoire goes by the name of Papa Samedi and runs a hoodoo/voodoo business out of the MacMillan Building on King West. That evening, Henry and Vicki head down to Samedi's place. Angelique wants to come along, but Vicki advises Angelique to stay safe, so Angelique places a protection bracelet on Vicki for her safety, too.

Papa Samedi immediately recognizes that Henry is a vampire and asks them what they want. Vicki explains that they are looking for Angelique's brother, and Samedi laughs. He calls Angelique the ""Voodoo Queen"" and explains that she and her brother are the ""family from hell,"" both practitioners of Dark Voodoo. Samedi explains how the ""crone"" keeps her youthful appearance by killing innocent children and feeding on their hearts while they are still beating. He admits to killing Royale and burying his bones in a cemetery in Toronto, but he keeps Royale's soul in a glowing green amulet that he wears around his neck. Angelique's intention, according to Samedi, is to get back her brother's body and restore him to life. If she does that, Samedi warns, children will start dying in Toronto, too.

Meanwhile, Coreen is watching as Angelique conducts a voodoo ceremony that Coreen thinks is a love spell to get a certain vampire to fall in love with her. When Coreen keeps interrupting the juju with her comments, Angelique hisses at her to shut up and takes away Coreen's mouth. Suddenly, Samedi's zombie collapses and so does Samedi. That old girl, he mumbles, must have used Vicki in order to get to him and steal his soul. Vicki rips the bracelet from her wrist and tosses it aside, but it is too late. With his dying breath, Samedi begs them not to let Angelique get hold of the amulet around his neck.

Remembering the Angelique is with Coreen, Vicki grabs the amulet, and she and Henry race back to the office. They find Coreen with her mouth missing and Angelique holding a Vicki voodoo doll. Vicki tries to rush her, but Angelique squeezes the doll and Vicki collapses in pain. Angelique places a worm inside the doll and threatens to tell it to eat Vicki from the inside out unless Vicki hands over the amulet by tomorrow night so that she can use it to resurrect her brother. Then Angelique disappears into the dawn. Fortunately, when Angelique disappears, Coreen gets back her mouth. While Henry returns to his condo to sleep for the day, Vicki gives Coreen the task of calling all the cemeteries in Toronto to see if any of them buried a body that was shipped from New Orleans after Katrina struck. After a day of telephoning, Coreen hits paydirt. A body from New Orleans was shipped to Mount Pleasant Cemetery eleven months ago. Payment was in cash, and the name given was Damballah, whom Coreen recognizes as a voodoo sky serpent.

Still in pain, Vicki heads to Mt Pleasant to look for Royale's body. When Henry wakes up and calls to see how Vicki is doing, Coreen tells him that Vicki is at Mt Pleasant. She also informs Henry that one of the books she read about voodoo said that salt would stop a zombie. If they taste salt, a zombie will be reminded of their mortality and return to the grave. Henry grabs a box of salt and rushes out the door. Meanwhile, Vicki has found a crypt with the name ""Damballah"" over the door. She goes inside and encounters Angelique preparing for a ceremony. By the time Henry finds the Damballah crypt, he finds Vicki lying on an stone slab. Henry dangles the amulet in front of Angelique and tells her to release Vicki.

Suddenly, a zombie grabs Henry from behind and holds him securely so that Angelique can take the amulet from Henry's hand. When Angelique raises a dagger and prepares to sacrifice Vicki's life in trade for Royale's, Henry wrestles the zombie to the ground and pours salt in his mouth. Henry then sees the Vicki doll and makes a grab for it. He pulls out the worm, and Vicki's pain stops. Vicki punches Angelique a good one, giving Henry time to grab the amulet and crumble it in the palm of his hand. Angelique screams ""No!"" as Royale's bony arm reaches out of his tomb and pulls Angelique in with him. Henry pulls Vicki from the crypt just seconds before the angry Damballah causes it to explode. Henry offers Vicki the Vicki doll, but she doesn't want it. They kiss, thank each other, and part ways.

Epilogue: Mike drops by Vicki's office for her explanation about the bodies he just found in and around the exploded crypt in the Mt Pleasant Cemetery. Vicki suggests they do lunch. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Vicki watches a TPD tape on which Sarah is interviewed about her mother's murder, but Sarah denies that anyone was in the house. She claims her mother simply went into the kitchen, called her name, and then began screaming. Vicki's gut tells her that Sarah is hiding something, so she pays a visit to the Cobb Academy for Gifted Children, where Sarah is currently residing. Vicki attempts to talk with Sarah about her father, but it quickly becomes apparent that Sarah believes her father hates her.

Vicki calls Henry Fitzroy to accompany her to Celeste's house to search for anything that might tell them where Steve is currently living. The blood on the kitchen floor makes Henry hungry, but he curbs his appetite and helps Vicki look through the mail. They find nothing from Steve, but they do notice a drawing made by Sarah of her mother in the kitchen with an orange monster. The drawing was mailed to Celeste a week ago by Sarah's art teacher, Laurel. A note attached to the picture says, ""Celeste, call me."" Henry diagnoses a vivid imagination, but Vicki photographs the drawing and takes it with her. A visit with Coroner Rajani reveals that whatever tore Celeste up was angry because it continued to bite and claw even after she was dead, however, there was no saliva found in the bites. Henry shows Rajani the drawing of the monster and asks whether it could have killed Celeste. Rajani says, ""Yes, if it existed."" Henry is beginning to believe the drawing is actually a ""photo from a crime scene,"" but Vicki is still putting her money on Steve Jeffries.

With nothing more to go on other than that Steve is a mechanic and likes old cars, Vicki has Coreen call around to see if she can locate him. By sundown the next day, Coreen hits paydirt. Steve Jeffries works at a Vintage Auto garage in Maypole. Vicki pays him a visit, but Steve produces an ironclad alibi. Furthermore, he wants nothing to do with his daughter. Vicki talks with Mike and finds out that phone records show that Steve made a call to the Cobb Academy, so it's back to Cobb to talk again with Sarah, who still maintains that her father hates her because she was bad. Having been abandoned by her own father when she was young, Vicki tries to explain that it wasn't Sarah's fault her father left. In an attempt to psychologize, Vicki shows the drawing to Sarah and asks if the monster was her dad. ""That's Buttercup,"" Sarah says, and holds up her orange stuffed animal. ""Buttercup wouldn't hurt anyone.""

Vicki goes to the art room to talk with Laurel. At first, Laurel is reluctant to say anything but finally admits that it was she who talked with Steve. She was becoming worried because Sarah's drawings were becoming more violent recently, and she wanted Steve to know that Celeste was planning to move Sarah into another school, something that Laurel actually supported. It was her impression, however, that Steve didn't much care. Unbeknown to both Vicki and Laurel, Cobb is listening at the door to their conversation. Cobb retreats into a locked room in which students are working one-on-one with their teachers. He singles out Sarah and tells her that Laurel is planning to send her away and to take Buttercup from her. Sarah becomes upset and lights start flashing and tables rattling. Cobb further goads Sarah, telling her that Laurel wants her out of her class and that Laurel hates her. ""Then I hate her!"" Sarah replies, grasping Buttercup tightly. ""Let Buttercup go,"" Cobb orders. In the art room, an orange monster suddenly appears and goes after Laurel. Vicki is thrown to the floor and screams at Laurel to run.

Later that evening, Vicki and Henry pay another visit to Steve. Steve refuses to get involved until Henry uses his powers of persuasion. Steve shows them the claw marks on his chest and tells how Sarah's doll Buttercup almost killed him. Sarah is telekinetic, he explains, and she has gotten worse after being at Cobb Academy. It was in fear of his life that he ran away, and he's not about to go back even if it means abandoning his daughter to Cobb. When Vicki returns to the office with some fast food for dinner, Coreen informs her that Steve just called and said he had a change of heart and was going over to the Cobb Academy to rescue his daughter. Afraid for Steve's safety, Vicki phones Henry and asks him to meet her right away at the Academy. Henry jumps in his car, not knowing that he's being followed by Mike, who has been conducting a background check on Henry and becoming disturbed by what he is finding, i.e., Henry has NO background, draws a comic book called Blood Price, and appears heavily into blood.

Vicki gets to the Academy first and intercepts Steve. Together, they intercept Cobb as he's going into the locked room. Sarah is pleased to see her father until Cobb says that her dad has come to take Buttercup away. Sarah gets angry, hugs Buttercup, and lights begin to flash. Meanwhile, Henry and Mike have made it to the Academy. They join together and start looking for Vicki. When they can't get through the locked door, Mike goes searching for another way in, and Henry simply breaks the door down. They find Vicki trying to explain to Sarah that her father loves her and that he's proven it by coming back for her. Henry vamps out and puts Cobb in a neck lock until Sarah realizes that it was Cobb who has been lying to her all along. Sarah runs into her father's arms and they hug each other.

Epilogue: Cobb is placed in custody. Sarah throws Buttercup away and goes home with her dad. Having seen Henry vamp out, Mike now realizes Henry is a vampire, and he's not happy about it. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0915935/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,"Vicki runs up against a Celtic spell when she investigates why a judge, prosecutor and defense attorney are being targeted.",[],TV-14,Release date,['David Winkler'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"When Barbara Stamp's husband, defense attorney Fred Stamp, is found dead from an apparent heart attack, Barbara hires Vicki Nelson to investigate Magnus O'Connor, a convicted killer whom Fred failed to successfully defend. The reason Barbara suspects that Magnus had something to do with it is because of a threatening message she found from Magnus on her husband's voicemail saying, ""You failed me. You're a dead man."" Vicki learns from Mike Celluci that Magnus has a long record of assaults, including six hits with the Irish mob in Montreal. The only problem is that a week ago Magnus committed suicide in his jail cell. On Henry Fitzroy's suggestion that Magnus might have hired someone to kill Stamp, Vicki pays a visit to his family. Magnus's mother, Lavena, is not willing to talk and orders Vicki to leave their house. Just before Vicki leaves, Magnus's brother Brady warns her that anyone who crosses the O'Connor family gets hurt.

With no leads there, Vicki talks with Coroner Rajani Mohadevan whose autopsy showed unusual bruises on Stamp's heart, as though someone reached into his chest and squeezed his heart until it stopped beating. Dr Rajani also shares with Vicki the report of Magnus's death, including the drawing of a large pentagram that he inflicted upon himself prior to killing himself. Further information from Mike reveals that Magnus was found lying within a circle of salt and candles. When Henry hears the details, he suspects that Magnus may have been performing a Celtic ritual meant to give him powers beyond the grave. Against his better judgement, Henry suggests that he and Vicki visit a psychic reader to obtain more information about the ritual. Sinead happens to be one of Henry's problematic ex-lovers, but she is able to identify the ritual as Wiccan last rites, a cleansing spell meant to pave the way to the afterlife. Sinead also recognizes the pentagrams on Vicki's wrists as being concentrations of power.

The next day, Vicki learns that George Neely, the prosecuting attorney at Magnus's trial, has also been found dead under the same circumstances as Fred Stamp. This time, Rajani has been able to take fingerprint visualizations from both Neely and Stamp's hearts, and she has matched them to those of Magnus O'Connor. Now concerned that Magnus is somehow exacting revenge on everyone involved in his trial, Vicki attempts to warn the presiding judge, Robert Pettigrew. She finds Pettigrew cowering in his panic room after receiving a phone call from Magnus, just like Stamp and Neely before him. Pettigrew fills her in on the details of Magnus's conviction. It seems that Magnus, whom Pettigrew refers to as a ""killing machine,"" was stopped for a traffic violation years ago, and the arresting officers quite unexpectantly found a severed head in the front seat of the car. When a rookie homicide detective opened the front door to the vehicle, the head rolled out of the car, and the rookie threw a coat over it, legally corrupting the evidence. However, Neely, Pettigrew, and the rookie kept that fact secret during the trial so that Magnus would be railroaded into a conviction. Vicki offers Pettrgrew sanctuary and asks Henry to escort him to a motel. However, it is too late. Unable to be stopped, Magnus walks right through the front door and goes for Pettigrew's heart. Vicki makes a grab for Magnus's ankle and notices that the pentagrams on her wrists are glowing. Magnus notices the pentagrams, too, but keeps heading for Pettigrew.

Vicki is devastated that she was unable to save Judge Pettigrew. When Mike and his superior, Chief Crowley, question her, Vicki tells them what she has learned so far about the connection between Stamp, Neely, and Pettigrew, so Crowley sends a squad to question Brady again. Again, Brady refuses to say anything other than to profess his own innocence and assure them that Magnus did not hire a hitman. Vicki and Henry also pay a second visit to Sinead, who confesses that the ritual Magnus performed on himself wasn't a cleansing spell; rather it was a binding spell. He bound himself to someone in order to block his passage to the afterlife. Sinead will not say to whom, but she does suggest that they look closely at the photos of Magnus, as the answer is there. Vicki, Henry, and Coreen spread out all the photos and scrutinize them until Henry notices the word Mathair painted on Magnus's skin. ""That's Gaelic for mother, he says.

Mike has learned the name of the rookie who spoiled the evidence and then kept silent about it. It was none other than Chief Crowley. Vicki and Henry go looking for Lavena O'Connor, and Mike returns to the station to ""babysit"" Crowley. Vicki and Henry find Brady with his arms and legs literally fused into a chair. Brady confesses that it was his mother's doing. She put a spell on him to punish him for talking. Brady also confesses that it was his mum who turned Magnus into a killing machine and, in fact, she made Magnus commit suicide by casting the binding spell on him. Brady assures them that the spell on him will wear off eventually, so Vicki and Henry return to the station.

Crowley has reluctantly opened up to Mike about why she tossed her coat over the severed head. It rolled out of the car in full view of a playground crawling with children. She didn't want the children to see the head, so she tossed her coat over it. She refuses to say more about the incident and decides to go home. Mike follows her to the parking lot just as Vicki and Henry arrive. Lavena is also there, chanting a spell, so Henry rushes over to stop her. Magnus suddenly appears and makes a grab for Crowley's heart. Vicki races over and shoves her hand into Magnus's ghostly chest, grabbing onto his heart and pulling it out. Magnus disappears, Lavena collapses, and Crowley falls to the ground, shaken but alive.

Epilogue: Mike's report says that Lavena O'Connor attacked Chief Crowley in the parking lot, although he did leave out the part about her weapon of choice being her dead son. When Vicki and Henry depart the station together, Mike takes the fingerprints off a glass of water from which Henry was drinking. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

The next morning, however, even before Vicki can begin her investigation, Marcy is found strangled. When Vicki shows up at the Howsen house, TPD Detective Mike Celluci is already on the case and preparing to lead Gary away. Gary tells Vicki that he spent the night in his office and came home this morning to find Marcy dead. He now wants Vicki to investigate the homicide. Vicki questions whether Gary might be using her as an alibi, but starts asking questions anyway.

First, Vicki talks with the neighbors. Wendy, Cheryl, and Isabel don't buy that Marcy was having an affair. Marcy loved Gary, they claim, and must have been murdered by an intruder, but they can provide no more information since, at the time, they were all three attending flower arranging lessons with their hunky gardener Emmanuel. After talking with Emmanuel, who confirms their story, Vicki runs into Cheryl's husband Bruce Caldwell who is looking for Cheryl but takes the time to talk to Vicki about the investigation while Vicki appears more fascinated with Bruce's collection of mythological statues. The next day Vicki returns to talk with Emmanuel again and finds him and Isabel in flagrante delicto. When they are joined by Cheryl and Wendy, all wanting to talk with Emmanuel about his ""gardening,"" Vicki becomes convinced that Emmanuel had something to do with Marcy's murder, although Mike and the TPD are still placing their bets on Gary. That night Vicki gets Henry to attend a party at the neighborhood Country Club and to talk individually with Marcy's three friends about the night of the murder. They all acknowledge that Emmanuel was with them and that they were practicing Japanese shoka, but they don't seem taken by Henry's charm, which has Henry puzzled.

Vicki has begun having erotic dreams at night, as though someone is in bed with her and is caressing her body with his hands. Assured by Henry that it isn't him (although he wouldn't mind), Vicki confides in Coreen as they are walking home from the party. Coreen thinks it might be an incubus, but before she can say much about it, a scream pierces the night. It's coming from Isabel's house. Vicki orders Coreen to call the police while she races into the house to help. She finds Isabel in bed with a black-caped figure bending over her and drawing her lifeforce out of her mouth. Vicki tries to put a stop to it, but the caped figure bats her across the room. By the time Vicki gets back on her feet, the figure has disappeared and Isabel is dead. Isabel's husband and Bruce Caldwell come running into the bedroom, but it is too late.

When Vicki, Henry, and Coreen get back to the office, Coreen googles demons attack night and comes up with information about incubi. Henry explains that, if a woman succumbs to an incubus, it can carry her soul to Hell. Vicki fears that the incubus may be Emmanuel, and Henry concludes that that would explain why Marcy's friends were not charmed by him...they were already under the charm of an incubus. There are also pictures of fertility idols on the websites, and Vicki recognizes them as similar to the ones she saw in Bruce Caldwell's house. Vicki corners Cheryl and finally gets the truth out of her. They were playing around one night at Cheryl's house, drinking and complaining about their husbands, when one of them started playing with one of Bruce's statues, i.e., rubbing it. That night they began having erotic dreams, and Emmanuel showed up soon after that. The night of Marcy's murder, Cheryl was with Emmanuel, and the shoka class was invented to cover for her.

Because Emanuel hasn't been seen since Isabel's death, Coreen consults with Dr Sagara, professor of Demonology at the University, to learn how to summon and trap an incubus. They will need a ritual circle, spruce for manifestations, civet for lust, and a sexually-frustrated woman to serve as bait. That night, while Henry and Mike quibble with each other like children in a sandbox, Vicki sleeps inside the ritual circle they have drawn on the floor. When Emmanuel shows up, he is trapped inside. But when asked why he killed Marcy and Isabel, Emmanuel denies doing so. Why would I kill them, he questions. Although each of the women were highly successful in their careers, he explains, they were sexually frustrated and he merely made them happy. He had a good thing going, and it must have been someone else who killed them. But who?

It's back to googling for Coreen. Another of the idols in Bruce's collection was that of Megaera, one of the angry Furies from Greek mythology. Megaera is attracted by jealousy. Vicki puts two and two together and realizes that everyone in that circle was jealous of each other, but the angriest appears to have been Bruce Caldwell, who was jealous of his wife Cheryl because it was her money who paid off the mortgage on the large house in which they live. Vicki, Mike, Henry, and Emmanuel head for the Caldwell house where Bruce has just summoned Megaera and is siccing her on Cheryl. When Henry and Mike enter the house, continuing to bicker at each other, Megaera turns away from Cheryl and heads for Henry. The two undeads have at each other until Vicki slices through Megaera with her police baton, and Megaera disappears.

Epilogue: The police lead Bruce Caldwell away while Henry and Emmanuel exchange views on the women they have seduced over the centuries. Mike denies being jealous of Henry, saying that he is only concerned for Vicki's safety. Vicki points out that, everytime she has needed him, Henry has been there for her.

Elsewhere, Mike is approached by a mysterious stranger who knows more about Henry.",[],TV-14,Release date,['James Head'],"['', '', '']",[],"['silver bullet', 'wendigo']",[],"When a fourth homeless person disappears and is presumed by the homeless community to have been murdered, her friend Annie takes up a collection and offers the proceeds ($98.56) to Private Investigator Vicki Nelson if she'll help find Francine's killer. Francine's body hasn't been found, so Vicki snoops around the park where the homeless live and finds drag marks that lead to a storm sewer where she recovers Francine's bloodied purse. She asks Henry to also snoop around the sewer to see whether he can find anything that she might have missed. What Henry finds is a torch of fire waved at his face by a Native American named Peter, who claims to be hunting the wendigo who killed his father years ago. A wendigo, Peter explains, is a cannibalistic spirit who drinks the blood, eats the flesh, and sucks the marrow out of the bones of humans. And if a wendigo sees you, he adds, you are marked for death.

Meanwhile, Vicki takes Francine's purse to Mike Celluci at the TPD and asks him to have the forensics team bag and log it for her. In return, Mike asks for Vicki's help on a case he's been working on...a ""working girl"" found murdered, drained of blood, and with bite marks on her neck. His only lead is a strange-looking man he noticed in the crowd surrounding her body and who disappeared when the police photograph turned to get a picture of him. Chief Crowley thinks that Norman Bridewell, the ""Vampire Killer"", may be back, but Mike is placing his suspicions elsewhere...on Henry Fitzroy. Mike wants to talk with Henry and needs Vicki to set it up for him.

Mike's case against Henry gets a shot in the arm when he is visited by the strange-looking man that he saw in the crowd amassing around the body of the ""working girl."" Javier Mendoza [Julian Sands] introduces himself as a church official who is also hunting for Henry. Mendoza produces photos of a young girl named Delphine Guillaume that Henry killed some 60 years ago. Mendoza asks for Mike's help stopping the vampire, but Mike isn't sure that would be ethical on his part and prefers to go about it legally. Unfortunately, the meeting between Mike, Henry, and Vicki doesn't go well. Not only does Mike present Henry with photos and questions about the recently-murdered ""working girl,"" but he also slaps him with photos of cold case murders from over the years. Henry denies knowing or killing any of those girls, but when Mike shows him the photo of Delphine Guillaume, Henry admits to killing her back in 1944.

Although Henry is now super POed at Vicki for the grilling he took from Mike, he and Vicki decide to take another look in the sewer. They pass pools of blood, piles of human bones, and torn clothing, and when they get deeper inside, they hear growling. Before they can determine where the growling is coming from, Peter shows up with his burning torch. Suddenly, the three of them are attacked by a tall, thin, humanoid figure with huge teeth and ghostly white skin and hair. Henry goes after the wendigo, but it knocks him to the ground, grabs Peter instead, and runs off with him. Vicki notices wounds on Henry's neck that don't appear to be healing. He says that he's lost a lot of blood, so Vicki rolls up her sleeve and offers him her arm. Henry refuses and walks away, the intent being that he'd rather get it from someone else.

Backed into a corner because of his knowledge of Henry's vampirism, his belief that Henry is a serial killer, and the fact that he won't be able to get Henry prosecuted anyway, Mike finally determines that his primary goal is to get Henry off the street and decides to go along with Javier Mendoza. He meets with Mendoza, who assures him that he's doing the right thing. Once a vampire has tasted a lover's blood, as Henry has tasted Vicki's, he will eventually kill her, Mendoza says. He asks Mike to help by placing an eight-rayed, gold medallion, which he calls the ""illuminatione del sol,"" on Henry's chest. It will sap him of his powers so that I can cure him of his urges, Mendoza explains. Mike agrees to do it, even though he knows that Mendoza will be acting outside of the law. In actuality, Mendoza is currently holding Delphine in chains, after making her confess that it was Henry Fitzroy who turned her. Mendoza removes the illuminatione del sol from Delphine's chest, and she reminds him of his promise to free her. The rising sun will free you, Mendoza assures her as he pulls open the curtains.

Meanwhile, Coreen has been googling information about the wendigo and discovered that each American Indian tribe has their own version of the wendigo and how to kill it. Silver bullets and fire seem to be the most common, but without more information about this wendigo, it's going to be difficult to determine which method will work. Then Vicki remembers Peter's story about his father's death. Peter was sitting near the campfire, and the wendigo didn't come near him. In the sewer, the wendigo grabbed Peter, but only after Peter dropped his torch. ""It's afraid of fire,"" Vicki concludes. ""All we need is a flame-thrower."" Coreen just happens to have one!

Once again, Vicki and Henry descend into the storm sewer, this time armed with Coreen's flame-thrower, which they tested before going down. When the wendigo appears, however, the flame-thrower doesn't work, so Henry is forced to wrestle with the wendigo while Vicki pulls down a live electrical cable and tosses it in the water in which the wendigo is standing. The wendigo is knocked for a loop, but he amazingly gets back up and starts advancing on them again. Suddenly, Mike appears and fires several bullets into the wendigo, causing it to explode. They were silver bullets, he explains, given to him by Coreen.

When Vicki asks Mike what he's doing there, he says that he has something for Henry. Before anyone can stop him, Mike whips out the illuminatione del sol and slaps it on Henry's chest. Immediately, the medallion digs its rays into Henry's chest and embeds itself. As Henry slumps helplessly to the ground, Mendoza appears. ""Time to pay for your sins,"" he says to Henry. When Vicki attempts to intervene, Mendoza calls her the ""vampire's whore"" and forces Mike to hand over his gun, lock himself and Vicki inside the sewer gate with Mike's handcuffs, and toss Mendoza the key. While Vicki looks on helplessly, Mendoza drags Henry away. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Mendoza has dragged Henry to a torture chamber where he is placed in chains so that Mendoza can begin the process of saving Henry's immortal soul. By the time Vicki and Mike make their way out of the sewer through a manhole cover, Vicki is so hopping mad at Mike that she suckerpunches him in the jaw. Now contrite, Mike offers to help her find Henry. Vicki orders Mike to go down to the station and pull everything he can on Javier Mendoza. When Coreen comes in, Vicki sets her to find out whatever she can about the illuminatione del sol.

Mike gets rookie Kate Lam [Françoise Yip] to take over the search on Mendoza so that he and Vicki can go to the streets and see what they can dig up on the murdered ""working girl"", identified as Amy Davidson, street name ""Champagne."" They corner another ""working girl"" named Cassis who, for a price, is willing to tell them about Champagne. When they show her a photo of Javier Mendoza, she recognizes him as one of her own past clients. About a week ago, he took her to the basement of an abandoned church, she says, where he had another girl in chains. When the girl tried to bite her, Cassis let them have it with Mace and got the heck out of there. A little more money, and Cassis is willing to take Vicki and Mike to the church where it happened.

Morning is approaching when Mike and Vicki break down the doors into the church basement. Instead of Henry, however, they find Delphine. She is close to death, so Vicki slits her own palm and feeds Delphine some blood. Before Delphine can answer any questions, however, a warning buzzer is heard, and the curtains on the windows automatically open. Within seconds, Delphine is reduced to ashes. In the mess Mendoza left behind, they find plant containers from Hollenbeck Nurseries and a chalice with some vile-smelling residue in it. Mike thinks maybe Coroner Rajani Mohadevan can identify it, so they take it along with them to HQ. Rajani identifies the residue in the cup as a mixture of blood and jiaogulan, a Chinese immortality herb. The blood also had some strange properties that she hasn't yet identified, which Mike and Vicki conclude is vampire blood.

While at HQ, they also hear from Kate. She hasn't found any current references for a Javier Mendoza, but she did discover that a Javier Mendoza was a Chief Inquisitor during the Spanish Inquisition. His specialty was forcing confessions from witches. What if he isn't a fan of Javier Mendoza but he IS Javier Mendoza, Vicki wonders. He'd be over 300 years old but he couldn't be a vampire because he's been seen outside in the daytime, Mike adds. Vicki puts together 2 + 2 (vampire blood + immortality herb) and concludes that Javier Mendoza is juicing vampires and mixing their blood with the herb in order to preserve his own immortality. If so, it's likely that Henry may still be alive. Vicki takes out a map of Toronto and marks Hollenbeck Nurseries and the locations where the hooker was murdered, Delphine was found, and Cassis was picked up. It's plain to see they've all occurred within a few blocks of each other. Realizing that Mendoza is conducting his own Inquisition and probably using holy ground, Mike and Vicki conclude that he may be hiding in another church somewhere. They decide to split up so that they can search more ground while keeping in contact by phone.

Meanwhile, Henry has been burned, beaten, whipped, starved, and had blood drained from him for Mendoza's immortality concoction. This isn't the first time Henry has met up with Mendoza. Several hundred years ago, he was captured by Monseignor Mendoza and subjected to Inquisition. Henry succeeded in convincing Mendoza's devotèe, a young girl named Maria, that he was not evil. When Maria finally relented and released Henry from his cell, Henry promptly fed on her and then offered her his blood in return, When Henry later returned for her, she was just waking up. Henry watched as she reached up to embrace Mendoza, and saw him pound a stake through her heart. Mendoza maintains that it was Henry who killed Maria, while Henry maintains it was Mendoza.

Coreen hasn't made any headway finding information online about the illuminatioine del sol, so she calls on Dr Sagara, Professor of Demonology at the University. Together, they pour through Sagara's mythology texts, but find nothing until Sagara focuses on the 8 arms of the medallion and realizes that 8 on its side () could be the symbol for infinity. Or immortality, Coreen adds. Continuing the search, Coreen discovers a drawing of the illuminatione del sol in a book on Chinese legends. It tells of a warlord whose only daughter committed suicide and returned as a chiang-shi (Chinese vampire). Not wanting to see her die again, the warlord found a wise Taoist priest who fashioned the sun to control her. There was only one problem. The sun is controlled by a key. If turned clockwise, it will release. If turned counter-clockwise, it will destroy the vampire's heart.

Vicki has come across an abandoned church and made her way down to the basement. When she opens the door, however, she is immediately knocked out and drops her cellphone. When Mike tries to phone Vicki and gets only her recording, he calls Coreen to see if she's heard from Vicki. She hasn't, but Coreen does pass on to Mike the information about the sun and its key. When Vicki comes to, she is tied in a chair. Henry, chained and bloodied, stands just out of reach, starving and struggling to get to her blood. Mike continues to look for abandoned churches and arrives at the right one just as Mendoza has pushed Vicki's chair within Henry's reach and left the room. Unable to control himself, Henry leaps at Vicki, but she has been able to release the binds on her hands and flips her chair over backwards, out of his reach. Henry strains at his chains until they break.

Mike has knocked out Mendoza and taken the key from him. He finds the room where Vicki is being held and opens the door just as Henry rushes at her. Mike knocks Vicki to the ground, and Henry sinks his fangs in Mike's neck instead. Fortunately, Vicki succeeds in stopping Henry from taking too much blood. As Mike falls to the floor, he hands the key to Vicki and tells her how to remove the sun from Henry's chest. Vicki then returns to help Mike as Henry makes Mendoza his dessert. On the way out, Vicki picks up the illuminatione del sol and puts it in her pocket. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

The last place Brendan was seen was at a certain nightclub, so that's where Vicki, with vampire partner Henry Fitzroy in tow, begins her investigation. While Henry circulates among the ""hotties"" and picks up the name ""Fox City,"" Vicki seeks out the owner. Elena claims not to know Brendan, but when Vicki and Henry later compare notes, Henry makes note of Elena's increased heartrate when Brendan's name was mentioned and Vicki picked up on some comments made by Elena about ""sexual predators.""

As Vicki and Henry wonder how Brendan could have been turned into a statue, they hear Elena coming in the front door with Mike, so they grab the statue and run out the back. Mike hears the back door closing and goes to investigate while Elena stands dumbfounded. Her statue is missing.

Vicki and Henry take Brendan to Vicki's office, where Coreen goes over the myths of creatures that can turn people to stone. It's either a basilisk or a Gorgon, Coreen concludes. Vicki goes down to the TPD and tries to tell Mike what she knows, but he won't buy that a phonecam shot of Elena's tattoo is evidence that Elena is lying. Vicki realizes by his refusal to consider Elena suspect that Mike is interested in Elena in a personal way, so she drops by Elena's club to speak with her, but bouncer Dimitri won't let her in. Vicki tells Dimitri to ask Elena if her house seems a bit empty lately, and Vicki goes back to her office. When she gets there, she sees someone poking around inside, so she arms herself and goes in. A man wearing a black ski mask knocks her for a loop, smashes Brendan into a million bits, and then runs.

While Vicki buries Brendan's remains, Henry and Coreen visit the nightclub for the purpose of looking for and photographing any other statues Elena may have on display. The next day, Coreen runs the photos through some purloined FBI software and matches them to photos of missing men. Coreen also searches the fabled Medusa and reads up on her myth, which she relates to Vicki. It seems Medusa was a beautiful young women coveted by Poseidon. One day he followed her to the Temple of Athena and raped her. Athena got angry over the desecration of her temple, blamed Medusa, and turned her into a hideous creature with snakes for hair and a gaze that turns people to stone. Coreen wants to tell Mike about Elena, but Vicki doesn't think he'll listen, so Vicki confronts Elena with the photos, but Elena simply tells her that she's nuts.

Now that Elena knows that Vicki is on to her, she is placed on the defensive. She orders Dimitri to destroy and get rid of the statues. Before he can do it, however, Mike drops by the club after being told about Medusa by Coreen. Elena sends Dimitri out for food while she and Mike talk. Mike asks Elena whether anyone had hurt her in the past because of her beauty and offers to help her. Elena confirms that she was violated and then told she deserved it because of her vanity. Suddenly, Vicki and Henry enter the club, Vicki carrying Henry's sword. Elena thinks it's a setup and turns on Mike. She removes her Elena mask and turns into the snake-haired Medusa. Mike immediately turns to stone. Then she looks at Henry, and he turns to stone, too. Using the sword, Vicki has blocked her view of Medusa. Then she swings the sword and beheads her. Mike and Henry regain their bodies as do all of the statues.

Epilogue: Henry returns to his condo and puts away his latest drawing of Christina, the vampire he fell in love with and who turned him. Vicki and Mike chill together in the park and discuss how people are all the time falling in love with the wrong persons. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0915937/?ref_=ttep_ep10,,Vicki is on the trail of a body that has apparently been resurrected.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Andy Mikita'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"The body of blackballed prize-fighter Diesel Swanson, who recently died of liver failure, is missing from the Garden Hill Mortuary. The funny thing is that the security camera video shows that he simply got up and walked out. Consequently, the mortician has hired Private Detective Vicki Nelson to investigate. The video also shows a masked figure dressed in black hovering over Swanson's body and placing something in his mouth just before he sat up. Vicki's vampire partner, Henry Fitzroy, thinks it may be some sort of necromancy. Based on the fact that the figure chose to enter and exit by an unwatched door and avoided showing his or her face to the security cam, Vicki thinks s/he was familiar with the layout of the mortuary, but the only ones working there are the owner, Boris Olonoff, and his son Ivan.

The first thing on Vicki's agenda is to interview Diesel's widow about his activities the past few months. Darlene Swanson explains how Diesel pretty much gave up on his career after he was fined by the Boxing Commission and placed on a 10 year ban, so he mostly hung out at a sports bar called The Dome where, for $600 a week and all the booze he could drink, it was his job to play host and schmooze the paying customers. Next stop is at the TPD where Vicki asks Mike Celluci to check police records for any previous reports of bodies missing from mortuaries or graves. Vicki then returns to her office to find that her office manager, Coreen Fennel, has been able to identify the mask worn by the bodysnatcher. It is a mask of Anubis, the jackal-headed Egyptian god of the dead, credited with the resurrection of Osiris. After reading the book of Egyptian Funeral Rituals and Resurrection Mythology by William Carmichael, M.A. that Coreen ripped off from the museum, Vicki learns about the seven Egyptian ""souls,"" the most important of which are the ba (the spiritual soul) and the sekhu (the physical remains). Egyptian bodies were mummified because it was believed that, if the ba wasn't able to recognize the sekhu, it couldn't return to it during the resurrection ritual.

Meanwhile, Mike and his partner Dave Graham have been called to a park where they find the nude, bruised, and previously-autopsied body of local wrestler Carl ""The Iron Fist"" Blundell who died of a brain aneurysm a few months ago. Thinking that Blundell's abduction may be related to that of Diesel's, Mike pays a visit to coroner Rajani Mohadevan and asks her to look up the cause of death for both Blundell and Swanson. Blundell's death was due to natural causes, Rajani assures him, but Swanson's toxicology report showed a high level of the OTC pain killer paracetamol (acetominophen) in his blood. Large doses of paracetamol can lead to liver failure, she explains. Mike wonders whether Diesel's wife poisoned him and decides to pay her a visit. Of course, Darlene denies poisoning her husband, but she does tell Mike about Diesel's drinking at The Dome. The bar is not yet open for the day, but Mike is able to talk to the bartender, who is sitting on the stoop smoking a cigarette. The guy recognizes a photo of Diesel but claims not to know Blundell. When Mike asks the bartender his name, the guy replies ""William Carmichael.""

Vicki has also paid a visit to Rajani, who is in the process of doing a second autopsy on Carl Blundell. Rajani notices something shoved in Blundell's throat and pulls out a broken clay tablet with Egyptian writing which, when compared to photos in Carmichael's book, matches the tablet used for the resurrection ritual. Henry is able to decipher Diesel Swanson's name on the tablet. Vicki wonders why it was broken in half, so Coreen suggests they consult with William Carmichael, the author of the manual she ""borrowed"" from the museum and the only expert they have on the subject. Vicki, however, wonders whether Carmichael might actually be the necromancer for whom they're searching. Indeed, it is Carmichael who has resurrected both Diesel Swanson and Carl Blundell for the purpose of staging boxing matches between dead fighters. The fights are held in a secret location they call The Necrodrome (translation: Dead Arena), where the select audience is able to view the fights and place their bets.

Vicki and Henry decide to snoop around Carmichael's apartment but are surprised to find Diesel Swanson guarding it. Swanson rushes at Henry, but Henry steps aside and Swanson jumps off the second floor balcony and runs away. Snooping in the wastebasket, Vicki finds a page of computer codes that Coreen is later able to trace to a website for The Necrodrome. The website shows highlights from the fight between Swanson and Blundell and contains a countdown until the next fight, which is scheduled to take place in less than 24 hours. Vicki immediately contacts Mike. After taking a look at The Necrodrome website, Mike and Vicki are able to piece together the story. Carmichael resurrected Carl Blundell in order to create The Necrodrome, but he needed a challenger, so he slipped paracetamol into Diesel's drink, killing him. He then resurrected Diesel Swanson for the Swanson vs Blundell fight, but now that Blundell is out of commission, he's going to need another challenger.

While Mike gets the computer technie at TPD to triangulate the location of the website broadcast, Henry listens closely to the broadcast itself to see if he can hear anything that might help them determine the location. In both cases, they are led to a warehouse near Union Station. Mike gets there first and finds Diesel Swanson being held in a cage. Diesel pleads with Mike to let him die, but before Mike can do anything, he sees someone in an Anubis mask leading William Carmichael with a bullet hole between his eyes. ""I think we've found our next challenger,"" says ""Anubis"". When Vicki and Henry arrive at the warehouse, Vicki sees Mike's car and notices a number of men streaming in the door to the warehouse. After the last man enters and the bouncer closes the door, Henry knocks him out. Vicki then enters the warehouse and instructs Henry to wait three minutes then come barreling up to the door in Mike's car with the sirens blaring.

Inside the warehouse, Vicki sees Mike in the cage with Diesel and William. When the sirens from Mike's car start blaring, Vicki yells to ""Anubis"" to put his hands up. However, ""Anubis"" has appropriated Mike's gun, and he points it at Vicki. He then pulls off his mask, revealing himself to be Ivan Olonoff. Just as Ivan locks Vicki in the cage with Mike, Diesel, and William, Henry jumps Ivan, knocking him out. Diesel grabs Mike, and William goes after Vicki, but she is able to break his neck. Henry rips open the cage, releasing Vicki who tosses him a bag containing the broken half of Diesel's clay tablet. Diesel grabs the tablet and starts to walk out of the arena, saying that he wants to see his wife. Vicki reminds him that he's in no condition to do that but Henry suggests an alternative.

Diesel has been returned to the Mortuary. As he lies on the embalming table, Darlene is led in to share a private moment with her ""dead"" husband. She holds his hand, tells him she loves him, and is then led away by Vicki. Henry hands Diesel the clay tablet and, with tears in his eyes, Diesel places it in his mouth and expires.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0911175/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,Vicki goes undercover at a fertility clinic that has an astounding rate of success.,[],TV-14,Release date,['David Winning'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Mitch and Marlisse Lafoy had been trying for years to have a baby without success until they discovered the Hobman Clinic. Within a short time, Marlisse became pregnant. Something changed, however, as the pregnancy progressed. Marlisse is now living at the Clinic and refusing to see or even speak to her husband on grounds that his ""negativity aura"" is adversely affecting her pregnancy. Mitch believes that the Clinic has some sort of cultish hold over his wife, and he has hired P.I. Vicki Nelson to investigate. Vicki thinks the best way to investigate might be to go undercover, so she and TPD Detective Mike Celluci, posing as Mike and Vicki Wheeler, are going to avail themselves of the Hobman ""Total Body"" Technique.

After an initial interview with the Clinic's creator, Dr Richard Hobman, and his assurance that he can help Vicki to conceive a child, the first line of business is to obtain a sample of Mike's ""swimmers."" After a number of kisses with ""wife"" Vicki (for show only, of course), Mike is led away and Vicki is left to fill out forms and to undergo a physical examination. While Vicki is busy and after Mike has done his part, he is free to leave the Clinic, so Vicki has asked him to run a check on Richard Hobman. The profile comes up clean. No complaints, no lawsuits, and the Hobman Clinic has a success rate twice that of other fertility clinics. Hobman's ex-partner, Dr Weaver, portrays Hobman as a dedicated researcher, but admits that, after Hobman studied in vitro fertilization techniques in Vienna some 10 years ago, he became involved with ""mind-healing"" and with ""holistics"", which Weaver characterizes as just a euphemism for ""untested.""

Meanwhile, Vicki has also charged Henry and Coreen with interviewing the Deskins, successful Hobman clients whose testimony is featured on the Hobman website. Mr Deskin is happy to speak with them, although his wife passed away a few years ago after falling off a ladder. When Travis Deskin, the much-sought-after son, comes in the front door, Henry smells animal blood on him, and shifty-eyed Travis also seems wary of Henry. Coreen does a websearch and finds that a large number of pets have recently disappeared in the Deskin neighborhood. When Vicki hears about it, she tells Coreen to interview other parents of children conceived at the Hobman Clinic and to take Henry with her on the chance that Henry can detect anything similar in their children.

The next morning, Vicki is presented with an herbal drink that head nurse Jonah describes as consisting of black cohosh, red clover blossoms, dong quai, Chaste tree berry, and some other things that are all part of Dr Hobman's ""patented treatment"" and that serve the purpose of increasing the uterine lining and moistening the mucous membrane. As the day goes on, Vicki meets some of the other expectant mothers, such as Rachel Teertstra who is a relative newcomer to the Clinic but can't say enough about the spalike atmosphere. Marlisse Lafoy, the wife of Vicki's client, is on bedrest in the secluded wing for high risk pregnancies, but Vicki is allowed a short visit with her. Marlisse is elated that the birthdate is near, and when Vicki expresses her concern over being sequestered and her worries for the health of the babies, Marlisse proudly allows Vicki to feel her bulging abdomen. Expecting to feel a kick or two, Vicki is horrified when the entire outline of the baby's face and body starts pressing through the skin. Vicki reveals to Marlisse that she is a private investigator hired by Marlisse's husband, but something in the herbal cocktail Marlisse just drank is causing her to fall asleep.

That evening, when the herbal drinks are again passed out, Vicki dumps hers in a potted plant just as Rachel begins to scream with excitement. She's been informed that her HCG levels have doubled, meaning that she is pregnant. When Vicki gives her a congratulatory hug, Rachel assures Vicki that she's going to be next because Jonah likes her, and Jonah is seen as a lucky charm with an instinct for who is going to get pregnant. When Mike comes to visit after dinner, Vicki gives him a sample of both her and Marlisse's herbal drinks and asks him to get Dr Mohadevan to analyze them.

Meanwhile, Coreen and Henry are following up on some of the other parents who have gone through the Hobman Clinic, but Coreen isn't having much success. In fact, one set of parents actually hung up on her when Coreen phoned. Henry and Coreen talk again with Mr Deskin, who is more forthcoming this time. Deskin shows Coreen a photo of another Hobman baby who looks just like his son Travis, and he admits that he has questions about whether or not Travis is his, or even whether Travis is totally human. Seeing Travis riding around outside on his bike, Henry decides to follow him. Travis leads him to a secluded woods where he meets up with his friend Gabriel. When Travis makes Gabriel blindfold his eyes and then picks up a large butcher knife, Henry steps in. He sends Gabriel home after planting the idea that he will not play with Travis again. To Travis, Henry plants the suggestion that Travis will not harm any person or animal again. However, as Henry later reveals to Coreen, he's not sure how long that suggestion will hold. There's something dark and evil inside Travis, he feels, and it's ancient.

Time is getting short before Vicki's conception therapy is about to begin tomorrow. So, later that night, she goes snooping. She comes upon the hydrotherapy room and sees a patient seated in a hydrotub, chanting a mantra while Jonah massages her shoulders. Before Vicki can notice the darkness spreading from Jonah's hands into the water, Vicki is led away by Dr Hobman, who admonishes her for peeking in on another patient's privacy. After everyone has settled in for the night, she goes snooping again. She makes her way into the records room and looks up the charts for Marlisse, Rachel, and several other women, noticing that the one thing they all have in common is hydrotherapy, evidenced by a blue flag on their file folder. Vicki concludes that something is happening to them during their waterbaths. She also notices that her own folder bears a blue flag.

Dr Mahadevan has determined that the herbal drink Vicki provided contains simply what Jonah said it did, however, the other sample contains a drug that would make a person feel happy, sleepy, and compliant. When Vicki and Mike exchange information on the telephone in the morning and Vicki learns about the compliancy cocktail, she confronts Marlisse in her bedroom, warns her that her baby is in danger, and advises her to get out of the Clinic. Marlisse, having seen her baby's face pressing through her skin just as Vicki saw it, realizes that Vicki is telling the truth and agrees to leave. As Vicki wheels Marlisse out of her room, she is stopped by Jonah. Jonah knocks Vicki to the floor and locks her in Marlisse's bedroom.

Henry and Coreen spent the night searching for information about the ""blackness"" that Henry felt inside of Travis Deskin. Coreen thinks he may be a swartalfen (black elf), legendary creatures known to switch their own ""twisted, unwanted offspring"" for a more desirable human child. In another book, Henry learns that the swartalfen of Protogermanic myth is an evil elf who impregnates women with his demon seed. As the children of these dark elves grow older, they begin to spread death and destruction wherever they go. Coreen thinks that Travis may be one of these alfenkinder, and Henry is concerned that Vicki is in their den, so he rushes to the Clinic.

Mike has done some more searching on Richard Hobman's background as well as on Jonah. He's learned nothing incriminating about Hobman, but when Jonah turns up as having been a general physician practicing medicine in the 1940s, looking the same as he looks in 2007, Mike heads for the Clinic albeit not before Coreen stops by to tell him about the swartalfen and to give him a bag of iron swords, pokers, and tire irons on the chance that the swartalfen can be killed with iron.

At the Clinic, Henry has found Vicki and is trying to talk her into leaving with him, but Vicki wants to stay in order to finish off the swartalfen. They head down the hall looking for Jonah just as Marlisse is wheeled into the birthing room. Suddenly, a cloud of fog fills the hallway, and Vicki and Henry are separated. They stumble around in the fog until Jonah in his swartalfen form appears and grabs Vicki. Henry wrestles with him just as Mike shows up and knocks out the swartalfen with one of Coreen's tire irons. The fog clears but Jonah is nowhere to be seen, so they all three go looking for him.

Jonah is in Marlisse's room, watching as Dr Hobman hands her a baby boy. Jonah asks to hold it. As he takes the baby in his arms, he reverts to his swartalfen form. Henry and Vicki rush at him, but Vicki drops her iron sword. Mike steps forward to swing his tire iron, but Marlisse stabs the swartalfen with the iron sword that Vicki dropped. Henry grabs the baby as the swartalfen disintegrates until he is just a small pool of blood on the floor. As Dr Hobman is led away in handcuffs and Marlisse, Mitch, and their baby are reunited, Mike and Vicki wonder whether the baby is a swartalfen. Henry says that the connection was broken when Jonah was killed but that he could still feel a darkness inside the child. ""Let's just hope it takes after its mother's side of the family,"" says Vicki.

Meanwhile, as two young boys walk their dog, Travis Deskin watches them from across the street, his pointed little ears clearly visible under his cap. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0915938/?ref_=ttep_ep12,,"Norman is back from his demon dimension, and things are not looking good for Vicki.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Peter DeLuise'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"When Camille Stokes, claiming to be psychic, shows up at the office of P.I. Vicki Nelson to warn her about a vision in which a demon is going to kill Vicki after he has amassed three objects -- a chalice, a grimoire, and a dagger -- Vicki is understandably shaken. Only a few months ago, Norman Bridewell, known to the public as the ""Vampire Killer,"" was about to sacrifice Vicki in a ritual to unleash the demon Astaroth from Hell and bring an Apocalypse upon the Earth. Vicki survived, only because vampire Henry Fitzroy was able to recite the incantation that sent both Norman and Astaroth back to hell, although Vicki now sports a mysterious pentagram on each wrist as a daily reminder of the experience. Camille's warning is even more believable because a chalice, grimoire, and dagger were the three magical objects that Norman used to summon Astaroth. Fortunately, Henry destroyed those objects. Or did he? When Vicki asks Henry if he kept his promise to destroy the objects, he becomes evasive. It turns out that he merely separated them and had each one placed in a safe place. Vicki is irate and demands that he get them back and destroy them for good. After all, her soul may depend upon it.

Henry agrees, and they first go looking for the chalice. Henry charged Maurice Baloc, a dealer in antiques who hates demons and black magic as much as Henry does, with hiding the chalice. However, Baloc refuses to give it back, reminding Henry of his order to never reveal the location of the chalice to anyone, including Henry. Not even Henry's assurance that the situation has changed will get Baloc to change his mind, so Henry and Vicki leave the shop empty-handed. Vicki and Henry are unaware that it was actually Norman Bridewell in the form of Camille Stokes who warned Vicki about a ""vision"" so that she would lead him to the objects. Norman has managed to return to Earth from Hell when the renter of his former apartment, a hockey player and body builder, cut his hand while lifting weights, and the blood fell on the floorboards where Norman had drawn the magic circle used to summon Astaroth. Not long after Vicki and Henry leave Baloc's antique shop, Norman shapeshifts into Vicki and tries once more to get Baloc to release the chalice, but Baloc has placed a concealment spell on it. Even he doesn't know its whereabouts, Baloc says, so Norman simply slits his throat with his long, black fingernails, knowing that the magic dies with the person who cast it. The chalice suddenly appears in full view on a table, and Norman walks away with it.

Meanwhile, TPD Detective Mike Celluci has been called to investigate a homicide. Since Dave Graham, his usual partner, is tied up in court all week, Mike takes along rookie Kate Lam, who is able to identify the body as that of a hockey player by his strong forearms and calloused palms. The body was found with his neck slashed and all the blood drained out, an M.O. that reminds them of the ""Vampire Killer"" from a few months back. Concerned that Vicki may be in danger, Mike suggests that she hide out at his brother's place in Mexico, but Vicki reminds him that a demon can find her regardless of where she runs. Mike winds up agreeing to help her locate whomever might be trying to summon Astaroth again.

The next night, as Vicki and Henry are walking down the street, they discuss collecting the grimoire, which Henry has placed in the care of his friend and one-time lover, Dr Betty Sagara, a professor of Demonology at the University. As Vicki and Henry discuss the dagger's whereabouts, they are unaware of the bum pawing through a nearby trashpile. That bum is actually Norman Bridewell. Now that Norman knows the location of the grimoire, he races over to Sagara's office and, after shapeshifting into Henry, requests the return of the grimoire, which Sagara has locked in a safe hidden behind a bookshelf.

After obtaining the grimoire from Sagara, Norman (still in Henry's form) goes to Vicki's office where he comes on to Vicki. Surprisingly, Vicki responds and, for the first time, kisses ""Henry."" Norman repays her by knocking her out. He then goes to Henry's condo, this time in Vicki's form, and does the same to Henry. While Henry lies on the floor, recovering from the slashes across his chest, aware that this is not the real Vicki, ""Vicki"" sniffs around the room until he smells the dagger hidden behind a wall panel. Using Henry's head, ""Vicki"" smashes open the panel and retrieves the knife. Quick as a flash, Henry grabs the knife from Norman's hand and holds it to her throat. ""Vicki"" points out that he might only have shapeshifted into Vicki Nelson's form but he might also have possessed Vicki's body. If Henry slashes ""Vicki's"" neck, he's taking the chance that he might be killing the real Vicki. Is Henry willing to take that chance?

Fortunately, the real Vicki solves Henry's dilemma by breaking into his condo at just that moment, and Henry realizes that ""Vicki"" is not Vicki. Vicki goes after ""Vicki"" with her baton, then notices that the pentagrams on her wrists have started to glow. With the increased strength of the pentagrams, Vicki is able to defeat ""Vicki,"" who returns to his form as Norman before shifting into a flock of bats and flying away, leaving the dagger behind. Vicki rushes to Henry's side as he lay on the floor and asks whether he was just in her apartment kissing her. Henry denies it, and Vicki scowls when she realizes that she was actually kissing Norman. ""But I hate to waste it,"" she says and plants a kiss on Henry's lips.

Now that Norman knows where the dagger is, Henry fears he will return, whereas Vicki fears for Coreen's safety. Vicki calls Coreen, and, sure enough, Norman has faked his way into the office by taking the form of Camille Stokes. Before Coreen can even answer the ringing telephone, Norman covers her mouth with his hand and answers the phone for her. He orders Vicki to bring the dagger to his apartment or kiss Coreen goodbye.

Meanwhile, Mike and Kate are at the Coroner's office to view another body found in a dumpster. Dr Mohadevan has identified the victim as Camille Stokes and estimates that she's been dead for several days. Mike recognizes the name as the psychic who visited Vicki and, when he hears her address -- 52 Lonigan Street -- he recognizes it as the same building where Norman ""the Vampire Killer"" Bridewell used to live. Just then, his cellphone rings. It is Vicki, calling to tell him that Norman is back and that he has Coreen. She agrees to meet Mike at Norman's apartment. Bothered by Mike's secrecy about this case and feeling that he's been shutting her out in favor of Vicki, Kate issues an ultimatum that Mike either let her in on what's happening or go it alone. Mike promises to tell her later, so Kate walks out.

Vicki and Henry have arrived at Norman's apartment to find him waiting, Coreen's hands bound, and the pentagram redrawn. Henry asks that Norman take him instead of Vicki, but Norman wants only Vicki and the dagger. Vicki takes the dagger from Henry and walks toward Norman just as Mike appears in the doorway, ordering her not to do it. Nonplussed, Norman magically binds both Mike and Henry against the wall and orders Vicki to bring him the dagger. Vicki tosses it at Norman, but he catches it neatly. He releases Coreen, grabs Vicki, and begins the incantation that opens the portal in the pentagram. He cuts Vicki's palm with the dagger and spills her blood into the chalice.

Suddenly, the dagger blade begins to glow and the blood in the chalice starts to bubble. ""What did you do?"" Norman screams. ""Had the dagger blessed by a priest on the way over,"" Vicki tells him. ""Oh, crap!"" Norman howls, realizing that it's all over. His holds on Mike and Henry are released. Henry jumps at Norman, grabs the dagger away, and stabs him with it. Shocked at the sudden turn of events, Norman tells Vicki that the pentagrams are not a curse but a gift and that, if she would embrace them, she could have anything she wants. Norman is then sucked back into the portal while yelling, ""I will be back!""

Epilogue: Henry promises to really destroy the magical objects this time, and he and Vicki compare notes on what happened between Norman and each of them when they thought it was each other, eventually agreeing to forget anything ever happened. [Full synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Bob Pinciotti (Don Stark) is Donna's father & Midge (Tanya Roberts) is her mother. Red doesn't like any machine that is not American built. The family had to buy a Toyota, since the gas prices are going through the roof. Red was offered $400 trade in for the Vista, but Red decided to offer it to Eric instead. Eric manages to get beer, as Kitty asks him to put the warm beer in the fridge in the basement.

Red Forman (Kurtwood Smith) and his wife Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp) want to hand the keys to the Vista Cruiser to their son, Eric (Topher Grace), to use. Through persuasion from his friends, Eric uses the car to get out of town for a Todd Rundgren concert in Milwaukee with his closest friends: his neighbor, Donna (Laura Prepon), Hyde (Danny Masterson), and Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). Eric also decides to invite a new foreign exchange student from school, named Fez (Wilmer Valderrama). Kelso's girlfriend Jackie (Mila Kunis) invites herself along, and Eric is uncomfortable around Donna when Kelso inadvertently tells Eric that Donna likes him. The gang doesn't like Jackie, but is not able to say anything to her face.

Hyde and Eric want Kelso to dump Jackie, but every time he tries, she lures him with make-out sessions, and he can't. eventually the gang allows her to come as there is a gas shortage, prices are high and the Vista takes a lot of gasoline to run. Jackie is rich and offers to pay for the whole trip's worth of gasoline. The gang have one of their pot sessions. Red and Kitty finally hand over the car to Eric, but not before giving him a full top down on insurance costs, that is requires maintenance, and that it's not a bedroom on wheels. All the time, Eric is totally stoned. No beer cans and donuts are allowed in the car. And no trips out of town ever. Of course, all rules are broken on the very first day when Eric is goaded to take the car to the concert. Turns out this was a ruse to get the kids away so Red and Kitty could have sex.

However, on the way to the concert the car battery dies; the only way they can get a new one is if they give up two of their concert tickets to the mechanic. The rest of the group forces Kelso to give up his and Jackie's tickets as they don't like her. While the rest are at the concert, Jackie and Kelso make out in the car, and Jackie asks Kelso if he wants to break up with her and Kelso, who has been telling the others the entire episode he wants to break up with her, tells her he doesn't so they can continue to make out. At the end of the episode, Eric and Donna sit on the hood of the car and before she goes home, Donna kisses him."

Kitty is obvious, as Eric is not allowed to open the fridge or the kitchen drawers, Kitty wants Eric to wear a particular shirt on his birthday, he sees 7 bags of potato chips that Kitty claims were on sale and his sister Laurie is coming to town. Kitty also wants Eric to go to the grocery store and get a large bag of frosting and 15 bags of regular M&Ms. Donna is older to Eric by a month. Eric is uncomfortable since money is tough around the house and he doesn't want any fuss on account of his birthday. Eric wants a cassette player for the car as his present, not an 8-track.

Meanwhile, Eric's older sister, Laurie (Lisa Robin Kelly), returns home from college for a weekend visit (and for the surprise party for Eric), and Kelso tries, unsuccessfully, to attract her attention even though he is in a relationship with Jackie. Laurie hates Hyde, as he won't pay any attention to her. Laurie is very sexually promiscuous and is somewhat of a tease. Eric makes a deal with Laurie to convince Kitty to call off the surprise party in exchange for the vista cruiser for an entire night. When Red finds out that Laurie wants to loan the Cruiser, he says that the Vista Cruiser is not dependable (it could break down and leave her at the mercy of any maniac who came along) and gives her his own brand-new Toyota and $30 for spending money.

Donna is also stressing over what she should get Eric for his birthday because she is unsure of the state of her relationship with Eric after she kissed him in the previous episode. She is not sure if she is still a friend or his girlfriend. She tells Jackie that she kissed Eric, and Jackie helps her choose a meaningful gift for him, a scented candle. Its practical and romantic. Eric dreams that Donna presents herself to him as his birthday present. He is then woken up in bed by Kitty for breakfast in bed.

Kitty still goes ahead with the surprise party. Red stops Eric from jumping ship. After the gifts are opened (he gets an 8 track tape player from Red & Kitty), Red takes Kitty and they go over to Donna's house with her parents Bob Pinciotti (Don Stark) and Midge (Tanya Roberts). Red wants to give the kids some privacy as they celebrate with Eric. Kitty is stressed about the fact that Eric is now almost a man. Kitty doesn't want to go as Eric is still her ""baby"" and she can't bear to see him grow up. Eric wants Laurie to help them get beer, but she refuses. Meanwhile Donna rehearses with Jackie how to give the candle to Eric, while the guys think Donna will have sex with Eric on his birthday. Eric meets Donna in the porch and opens his candle. They hold hands, when a drunk Kitty comes around crying that her baby is all grow up."

Money is tight around the house. Kitty serves Tuna casserole way too often. The other option is not pay car insurance and the family can have steak.

Jackie's father (Paul Kreppel), a city councilman, arranges for President Gerald Ford to stop at Point Place as part of his re-election campaign. Point Place is a whistle stop on his trail across Wisconsin. The principal of Point Place High School makes a speech warning against any ""maladjusted"" activity, which of course gives Hyde the idea to ""fight the power"". Red is angry at Ford as he allowed US jobs to be outsourced which is why he lost his own job. Kitty is pickled pink that Ford is coming to her house (which he is not). Eric is neutral about the whole thing and says that everyone is entitled to their own political opinion. Kitty bakes pies for the President.

The guys decide to streak naked when Ford comes to town for a campaign stop. Hyde wants to protest, Eric wants to look cool in front of Donna, and Kelso just wants to do something stupid and fun. Eric gives it some thought, but eventually decides to join Kelso and Hyde. Jackie's father holds a meeting of the organizing committee, which includes Bob, and says that they will hold a Q&A session with Ford. They decide to select the ""right"" people (the Average Joe, or in other words ""a loser"") to ask the questions. Meanwhile, Bob wants Red to ask Ford a question in the Q&A. Red first refuses as he is a democrat and hates Ford. Red agrees when he sees this as opportunity to embarrass Ford on National TV. However, Bob gives him a 'crappy' question (What has been your favorite Parade), leading Red to decide to ask what he wants anyway. Red says that a man can not stand idly by while everything is taken away from him, his job, his stability, his right to free speech. Eric borrows Red's trench coat.

Donna refuses to wear an American flag jumpsuit her father, Bob, gives her as it will embarrass her. But Kitty advises Donna that all family are embarrassing, or they are dead. So, she wears the flag jumpsuit and joins her parents. On the day though, everyone decides not to streak, as there are too many guard dogs and the Secret Service. The guys take a vote and decide unanimously to sit down peacefully. Donna is disappointed as she was looking forward to seeing Eric naked.

Ford falls to the floor 3 times before he can come to the podium to greet the audience. However, when Red gets up to ask his question, he stutters and starts to bomb. Even the dogs are looking at Red and judging him. In desperation, Eric puts on a Nixon mask and streaks across the auditorium, motivating Red to ask, ""How the hell could you pardon Nixon?"". Red later acknowledges Eric's role in bailing him out at the Ford reception."

Jackie pressures Donna to let Eric win. She says Eric will never be her boyfriend if she keeps beating him at sports. Hyde and Fez pressure Kelso to stand up to Jackie (Jackie controls each and every waking minute of Kelso). They want him to date someone who is less annoying than Jackie. Donna's mom Midge overhears Jackie's conversation and agrees with Jackie. She says women have to act weak and fragile (so men can feel superior) and that's the way they control men. Midge says that Donna can stick to her principles and then 40 years from now she will be telling her cats how she won a basketball game.

Donna beats Eric again (this time at air-hockey where Donna has claimed that she was a novice) and soon he starts to avoid playing with her. So, Donna tries to throw a game intentionally and Eric figures it out and is not amused by the pity. Kitty encourages Eric not to keep scores with Donna and to just enjoy her company, while he can.

Jackie wants Kelso at her beck and call and humiliates him specifically when he is spending time with Hyde and Fez. Kelso tries to stand-up to Jackie, but totally caves in front of her. Jackie makes it known to Hyde and Fez that she won in the battle for Kelso. When Hyde tries to confront him, he says ""at least he is getting some"". Next time when Jackie calls, Kelso tries to get Fez to listen to her, and Fez would tell him what to say while he played cards with Hyde. Only Jackie finds out when Fez gets excited when Jackie describes of her and Kelso's sex sessions to him.

Red's job hours at the auto plant are cut back and he is forced to stay home, keeping himself occupied by ""fixing"" things, much to Kitty's dismay. These are all the things that Kitty needs and uses and loves. Red only makes them worse and Kitty is afraid to point it out to him. He fixes the dryer in the basement and then the dining table in the kitchen (it wobbled slightly). But after Red fixes it, it is now slanted, but Kitty is afraid to point it out to Red. But Red finds out and by the time he is done with it, the table has no legs. Kitty breaks the garage door when Red tries to fix Kitty's refrigerator. This was Kitty's way to keep Red away from the house and fix things in his garage, where he can do minimum damage.

Eric and Donna decide to reconcile. But they play ball again and this time Donna wrestles Eric to the ground and grinds him into the dust. They end up in a position where Eric is on top of Donna and it becomes awkward for both. Red then sees Eric lose to Donna again at a basketball game and shifts his focus to training him. Kitty is super happy."

Later, after Donna leaves, Hyde makes Eric realize that Donna just invited Eric for a make-out session, and Eric totally dropped the ball.

Red is out of a job and Eric decides that he wants to help around the house by getting a job. Red encourages Eric as at his age, Red was working in a slaughterhouse. Kitty says that there is plenty of time later for Eric to find a job and grind the joy out of his life. Red helps Eric prepares for the interview, working on his handshake, his introduction, his posture. Red warns Eric that smart mouths get fired.

Hyde teases Donna on all the signals she was putting out for Eric. Donna is mortified that everybody knows. Donna feels very frustrated that she is putting herself out there, and yet Eric is not picking up any signals.

Then guys all go to Fatso Burger (Jackie's dad owns that place) for job interviews, but Eric ends up being the only one hired. Eric was the only one who gave good answers. Kelso says his girlfriend's dad owns it, Fez loves the uniforms, Hyde wants to unionize the workers. However, Eric finds that he and Donna can't spend as much time together because of it.

Meanwhile, Jackie is upset at Michael for not getting the job. Jackie's complains to dad Jack (Paul Kreppel) that Fatso Burger hired Eric instead of Kelso, but Jack explains that Kelso is a good for nothing and hence does not deserve a job. Kelso is likely to not follow instructions, spend time reading comics instead of working, not washing hands, and so on. Kelso believes that the store manager didn't hire him as he is good looking, and the manager was jealous. Jackie explains to Kelso that if he got the job at Fatso burger then he couldn't see her whenever she wanted. But secretly she wishes that Kelso would try harder to support her needs.

Bod and Midge leave and ask Eric to make sure that no guys come near Donna in their absence. During the party, Donna decides to go see Eric because she's depressed that they can't spend time together, however he turns her down as he is working. But when he comes back later, he is too late as Donna's parents have come back home early. Kitty visits Eric and finds that he is miserable. He is exhausted and is behind in all his homework. She tells Eric it will be OK if he wants to quit and that she will handle Red.

Eric speaks to Red about quitting his job and at first Red is supportive, but then makes snide comments about how it was a nothing job anyways. Afterwards, Eric quits his job so he can spend more time with Donna."

The gang finds a keg in the middle of the road after skipping school. They bring it back to Eric's basement. They decide to throw a party at a pool at a vacant home that Jackie's mother is attempting to sell. Kelso does quick math to figure out that they will make $224 if they sell $2 per entry. The pool is empty, and the party is at the bottom of the pool.

Meanwhile, Kitty invites Bob and Midge over, and while talking, Red works out that the gang are throwing a party (Eric took a bucket and 2 bags of ice and Donna took all the cups. They had told Kitty that they were building a volcano for a class project) and he and Bob set out to find the kids. Kitty and Midge are watching a TV show together ""Rich man, Poor man"". Red and Bob drive all over town but cannot locate the kids. Bob continues to annoy Red.

However, at the pool, they soon discover they need a tap to extract the beer. Eric sends Kelso out with his gas money to purchase one at the liquor store. Eric says he is happy to give up his gas money because by the end of the night they will make over $200 from the party. Kelso manages to buy the tap as the store clerk doesn't need any ID to sell a tap, as one can drink beer with a tap alone and Kelso wasn't buying any actual beer. However, after leaving the store, Kelso has the tap broken in half by two bullies from school (who broke Eric's pencil in 2 earlier in the day).

This forces Eric to have steal his father's tap. Eric says that Red doesn't have a tap, but Hyde knows that Red is a cocktail dad and thus must have a beer keg tap. Eric stands up to the bullies for breaking their tap, and Donna is really turned on towards Eric. This spurs Eric into action and he decides to bring Red's beer keg tap to the party. He manages to succeed as Kitty and Midge get very drunk while watching a TV show. Midge was sharing how Bob and her spike up their sex lives by role playing.

However, the rest of the gang gets caught as Jackie's mom begins showing the house to prospective buyers and they all try to unsuccessfully hide.

Red and Bob find out at the liquor store where the party is taking place, as apparently it has been advertised all over town. Eric returns with Red's tap, however by this point all the party guests have been forced to leave and Red and Bob are waiting there with a cop. Red then tells Eric to take Donna home, while he and Bob keep the keg for themselves.

Hyde doesn't want to go at first because he hates disco and can't dance. Fez doesn't know what Disco is. But when Donna says she would love to go, Hyde wants to do and decides to take dancing lessons from Kitty. Plus, Red also confirms that women love to dance and if men don't learn they will have to spend their life alone in the future. He is the one to suggest that he takes dancing lessons from Kitty. This was Red's way to ensure that Kitty doesn't get Red involved in her dancing frenzy and takes all of her energy out on Hyde.

Kitty tells Red that Eric and Donna are practically dating. Kitty can tell that Donna is interested. Eric doesn't have gas money for the drive to Kenosha, so he gathers all the junk from Red's garage and decides to sell it for scrap to get some cash. Red offers Eric gas money if he completes some chores around the house: Fix the shelf, sweep the garage, clean the gutters, pick up the cleaning, for $10. Eric was toasted on pot and barely hears and understands everything. The gang has the brilliant idea to record their conversation during their pot sessions.

However, Bob walks in on Kitty and Hyde dancing and thinks they are having an affair. Kitty takes some pictures, before sending the kids for their night of fun. She wishes Hyde good luck and arouses Midge's suspicion. Midge tries to confront Kitty about it, but it only makes Kitty think that Midge is having an affair. Midge kept on saying that she is seeking advise on behalf of her friend, and Kitty assumes that she is talking about herself. Meanwhile both ladies think about what it would be to be with a younger man.

Bob tells Red about it who at first wants to kill Hyde but then they realize Kitty was teaching Hyde to dance. Red was having fun with Bob, as he knew Hyde was learning to dance with Kitty, but he acted all angry and flustered so that Bob could back off and come to a more ""logical"" conclusion.

At the disco, it becomes clear that Kelso can't dance, which embarrasses Jackie. However, Fez convinces Jackie to dance with him, revealing that he is a great dancer. Meanwhile Kelso has been claiming all along that he wants to break up with Jackie.

This prompts Hyde to ask Donna to dance with him while Eric doesn't want to dance. During the dance Hyde tries to make a move on Donna (Hyde says that he wants to kiss Donna) which she rejects (She tells Hyde to shut up and dance). Meanwhile, Fez and Jackie are outside talking, when Kelso storms out of the disco and threatens Fez to stay away from his girlfriend. to which Fez responds that he was planning to be breaking up with Jackie.

Eric is a tad jealous that Hyde danced with Donna that night. He admits to Donna that he doesn't know how to dance and they kiss. The gang listens to their pot session tapes and realize that they are all stupid."

Jackie knows that this will be a make-out session for both couples (as The Omen is a horror movie and this will prompt the girls to stick really close to their guys), but Donna is afraid that it will be tacky and public. Donna wants to take Jackie as she can talk to her about it and that she and Kelso have ""done it"" a million times. Meanwhile Eric doesn't want to take Kelso and he sees Kelso as competition. Jackie tells Donna that she and Kelso haven't ""done it"", while Kelso confirms to Eric that they have.

On date night, Jackie shows up with Kelso to Red's garage just before Eric and Donna are about to leave. Jackie invites herself to movie night and forces Kelso to get into the car. Jackie and Kelso make out aggressively in the backseat making the situation even more awkward for Eric and Donna, eventually forcing them to exit the car as Jackie and Kelso keep hitting the front seat passengers with their feet, making it impossible for them to stay inside the car. They sit on the hood of the cruiser and end up making out. It is pretty public and all the other cars honk at their antics, but Donna and Eric cannot keep their hands off each other.

In the meantime, Fez's host parents don't want him to listen to 'the devil's music' a.k.a. rock music (they are devout Catholics). They prove it to Fez by playing the record backwards and the voice rings, clear as day ""Devil Love Me"" & ""Devil Lives"". In their next pot session, Hyde tells Fez that the Congress is putting secret messages in their records to kill rock and roll.

He and Hyde try to sneak rock albums into Fez's host home by hiding them in Pat Boone covers and listening to them with headphones.

Meanwhile, Kitty and Red decide to go out because Kitty thinks their marriage is too predictable (after reading Cosmo). She had taken the ""How Spontaneous is your relationship Quiz"". They scored a 3 out of 10, after Kitty cheated. Red suggests that they go to their usual place, but Kitty doesn't want that. They always order the Salisbury steak for Red and a big chicken for Kitty. She wants change.

They try to go to a posh restaurant, The Lion's Head (for which Kitty makes Red shave his neck with clippers), however it had burnt down and was replaced with a tacky restaurant. Red must pay $20 to circumvent a 2-hour waiting line.

Kelso figures that his dad helps his clients with a service to help them maximize the potential utilization of their data, but his dad disagrees with this definition as well. Kelso can't figure out in a whole day what exactly he does. Kelso decides to tell everyone his dad is a farmer.

Red is angry with Eric, and he is useless around the car and can't help him fix it at all. Eric cannot hold the flashlight properly and as a result Red cannot see what he is doing in the engine bay. Since Eric is gone for career day with Kitty, Red decides to work on the Vista Cruiser alone the following day. Jackie is not at career day as she is a sophomore. So, he comes by Eric's and finds Red working on the car. Jackie's father has no time and when she bumps into Red in the garage, she starts helping him fixing the car. Jackie holds the flashlight in a way that illuminates the entire engine bay, which impresses Red. Red is astonished that one member of the gang is not useless. Jackie even manages to change a tire and is super excited.

Hyde comes to Eric's and meets Red. Red helps Hyde understand that he should not run out on his mother. Hyde returns to Edna, who takes out for a beer.

Fez wants to become a dictator back in his homeland.

When Jackie finds out, she tries to act normal and tells Kelso that she has a date, who is better than Kelso in every conceivable way.

Jackie confides her worries to Hyde that she does have a date for Prom after bragging to Kelso. Hyde laughs at Jackie. Jackie now cries till Hyde takes her, even though they both agree that they hate each other. Fez doesn't take a girl (he wanted to take Jackie, but Kelso forbids it). Fez is convinced himself his English teacher is enamored with him as she writes nice comments like ""nice job"", ""good effort"" on his notebooks.

Eric is hoping the prom will allow him to take a next step with Donna, Hyde convinces him to take a motel-room Eric wants the night and sex to be spontaneous. But Hyde paints a picture where Eric could be back home at 10 pm and being called a loser by Kitty and Red (and both pointing and laughing at him), all because he didn't plan. Eric books the motel room. Meanwhile Donna is also excited about Prom and tells Jackie that this might be the night when she has sex with Eric.

Fez tries to dance with his English teacher at the prom, but the music teacher makes Fez a star on the disco floor by giving him a groovy beat to dance to. Donna & Eric both realize that they want to have sex, and Donna is glad that Eric got a motel room, but when they get to the motel room, it's grubby. The bedspread had a huge stain and the bathroom had a huge rat in it. Eric thinks this is not perfect. It is not like he or Donna pictured it at all, and calls it off. They both end up back at the Prom. Hyde cleans up pretty good and picks up Jackie for the prom. They look very cute together. Jackie confesses that she really wanted to go to the prom with Kelso, so Hyde speaks to him. Kelso is horrified to know that Jackie cried and that she really wants to be with Kelso.

Midge has decided she wants a job, or even better: her own greeting cards business (as she wants an easy job and one where she is her own boss), at Bob's expense. Bob tries to argue that Midge doesn't know the first things about business, but for Midge this is a zero risk plan as it is Bob's money. Kitty is not supportive of this plan either. Bob wants Midge to have another baby. Midge leaves in disgust.

At the end of the episode, Kelso and Jackie get back together at the prom and Hyde takes Pam. The English teacher dances with Fez and Fez takes the motel room key from Eric. The episode features Gloria Gaynor as the music teacher performing the hit I Will Survive."

Red has even less hours in the car plant and lost the salesman job with Bob. Kitty is struggling to make ends meet. They are very close to losing the house. Yet, the basement boys go see Star Wars in Kenosha and are instantly hooked, especially Eric. Kelso is instantly obsessed, wanting to see it repeatedly. Red is happy as a clam to hear Mr. Milbank has returned to re-open the plant full time and promises Kitty a celebratory dinner and a movie.

Eric's 'Jedi knight joy' gets a first blow when he is ordered to be nice to the boss's son, David Milbank (Scott Whyte). Eric had beat up David when he was still sickly (he had asthma back when he was a little boy), and now David has turned out to be bigger than any of the gang (David is tall and Handsome now). David starts hitting on Donna from the get-go. David pretends to be interested in Donna's short stories and goes over to her house to spend time with her. Donna is upset when Eric points to her that David is hitting on her. Donna says she is only friends with David. Eric says that Donna is naive as David just wants to seduce Donna. Which is why any guy pays attention to any girl. The gang tells Eric to fight for Donna and confront David.

Eric has a Star Wars dream. Eric as Luke Skywalker, Hyde as Han Solo, Kelso as Chewbacca, Red as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Fez and Jackie as Imperial Stormtroopers, Donna as Princess Leia, David as Darth Vader, and Kitty as a cleaning woman using R2-D2 as a vacuum cleaner. The dark side has free food. Leia claims that she is only friends with Darth Vader. Kitty sees that Eric gets the parental blessing to fight for his girl. When Red finds that David is making a move on Donna, he teaches the uppercut to Eric.

Kelso wants Jackie to come with him to see Star Wars. Jackie proposes sex instead, but Kelso says that they can have sex anytime they want. Laurie hits on Kelso and kisses him when Jackie won't go with Kelso for Star Wars. Eric goes to confront David, who admits that he is interested in Donna. Donna says that they are friends, but David tells Donna to grow up. He spent time with Donna and listened to her poems so he could seduce her. David agrees with Eric that he had every reason to kick David's behind. Donna is disgusted that Eric does not trust her or respect her and leaves.

David tells Eric that it wouldn't have worked out with Donna anyways since the plant will be closing soon and David will move out of Point Place then. The plant was opened full time to burn off the inventory and then would be closed for good. Eric uppercuts David. Eric doesn't tell Red about the bad news and lets his parents enjoy their celebratory night together (They are going for a dinner and a movie together). Laurie tells Eric that she has flunked out of college and had just made out with Kelso."

While making the fix, Michael takes a fall and badly hurts his arm.

The gang comes back home late at night and Eric seeks medical advice from his nurse mother (for Kelso's injury). Eric gets traumatized by accidentally walking in on his parents making love. Eventually, the gang takes Kelso to the hospital for treatment.

The unsavory idea even gets Laurie's sympathy, yet he rather lets them thinks he's on drugs. Laurie tries to reason that Red and Kitty are in love and have urges and needs, but Eric is not willing to consider that at all. Eric is acting weird in front of them, acting weird at the dinner table, can't look them straight in the eye, can't sleep for the entire night due to recurring nightmares. Kitty brings out the diagnostic chart for signs of drug use and Eric scores 9 out of 10. Blood shot eyes, mood swings, irregular appetite, odd sleeping patterns, and so on. Kitty is distraught. Red says Eric is just weird. But then Eric walks in looking all over the place and can't look his parents in the eyes. Red also believes that Eric is on drugs.

Jackie semi-nurses Kelso and makes him realize Hyde is no real friend, to little avail. Jackie says it was Hyde's idea to paint the pot leaf and then it was Hyde who made Kelso fix the mistake. But Kelso is clear that Hyde is his best friend. Kelso finally confronts Hyde by blaming him for his fall. Hyde refuses to apologize to Kelso, since neither did, he push Kelso or made the railing slippery to cause his fall. Kelso says that Hyde doesn't respect him and instead laughs at him. Hyde turns the tables by narrating how Hyde was bit in Kelso's back yard by his dog and Kelso did nothing but laugh. Kelso and Hyde forgive each other and are back to being friends again.

Donna goes on a date with Eric, but he is so traumatized that he won't even make-out with her. He tells Donna the truth. Donna says she saw her parents having sex when she was 12. She says that eventually the pain will pass, and he will be able to live again. But then Donna relives her horror with her parents and now won't let Eric touch her. They drive back home.

Red and Kitty talk to Eric about his drug problems. Eric finds it easier to accept the drug problem than to admit that he saw them having sex. Laurie tells Red and Kitty the truth. Red won't touch Kitty when she reminds him that he walked on his parents having sex that one time.

Chrissy is driving through town and staying in a motel. Chrissy drives a Vespa and calls love an outdated concept made by industrialists to keep girls subservient. Hyde loves Chrissy as she is dark, obnoxious, dangerous and paranoid. She is his perfect girl as she is easy too. Chrissy believes that the establishment doesn't want the people to feel good. So, every time they have sex is like a huge protest against the establishment. She tells him she wants to go to New York to start a punk band and when she asks him to go with her, Hyde must make a tough decision. Eric disapproves of him leaving Point Place.

Kitty tries to help Jackie in making a pie on a home economics assignment. Red and Kelso want to make smaller paddles for Pong to make Red's Atari Pong more challenging. It is awkward every time Jackie and Kelso run into each other as they are still broken up. Jackie keeps burning up pies as her mind is totally on Kelso. So, instead of watching the oven, she talks on the phone about her troubles and the pies keep burning. Kitty encourages her to take the money and buy a pie.

Meanwhile Red and Kelso bond over fixing the Atari pong machine. Red also feels that the Atari Pong game can up the challenge quotient and by then Kelso had already opened the machine. But Red warns that if Kelso can't put the machine back together, he will owe Red $118 or else Red will have to kill him. Kelso is an electronics wizard and Red knows nothing. Eventually, it works. Kelso thinks computers is the future, Red thinks its soldering.

Eric obviously fumbles with Donna's bra every time they are together. Donna is even able to anticipate Eric's moves as every time he goes for the bra, his lips stop moving. Donna feels neglected as Eric focuses all his attention on her breasts. Eric discusses his problem with Hyde, who tells him to buy a bra, practice on it at home and then gift it to Donna. At the next date, Donna is not wearing a bra to make it easier for Eric.

When Red finds out Hyde is thinking about moving to NYC, he and Kitty decide to talk to him as they know his mother drinks and doesn't care about him. They believe NYC is no place for a 17-year-old teenager. The Formans argue that Hyde needs a high school diploma and without it he is likely to end up as lower than nothing. Hyde simply walks away and Red blames Kitty for running the talk. Hyde is still determined to leave as this might be his only chance to escape Point Place. But after talking to Eric, Hyde realizes that his life and his friends are in Point Place. Hyde backs out to Chrissy.

Fez feels left out of everything. Hyde has run away with Chrissy and Donna & Eric want to do things alone.. which leaves Fez alone. He makes a big speech that every day he comes to the basement looking for friendship and acceptance, and he only gets rejection and abandonment."

Eric feels he killed her by his blunt retort and doesn't dare tell Red, even though Donna thinks he should.

The Vista Cruiser is parked in the driveway with Bernice in it. Eventually, Eric has no option but to deliver the news to Kitty. Kitty changes her attitude the minute she hears that Bernice is dead. Kitty refuses to consider that she ever said anything nasty about Bernice.

Meanwhile, Red's very emotional brother Marty (Pat Skipper) has arrived and is a millstone around Red's neck. Red is embarrassed by his emotional brother Marty. Laurie doesn't mourn but sees the advantages of her grandma's death. She had a paper coming up in the week which she was going to flunk and now has the perfect excuse.

Donna tries to convince Eric that he did not kill Bernice, but Eric knows that the shock of hearing her grandson tell her that she is nasty killed Bernice. Eric is depressed and Donna encourages him to talk to Red about how he feels. Eric says that talking is not going to help him. Only drinking can. Hyde takes him drinking instead. Eric and the guys go to a bar pretending to be soldiers, get hit on by some girls (Charlotte and Charlene) and end up in a fight. The boyfriends of the 2 girls arrive and pick a fight with the gang. They knock Eric out cold, prompting Hyde and Kelso to attack them. Fez stands by and continues his conversation with the girls. Eric comes home at 2 am and Marty encourages him to let out his feelings, while Red orders him to bottle it up again. Red sends Kitty and Marty to sleep and has a beer with Eric. Kitty hides her mixed feelings by cooking.

At the funeral, Jackie and Kelso have sex (Jackie thinks Humans are fragile beings). Kelso makes awkward comments, Fez consoles Red and is re-directed to Marty. At the open casket, Kitty asks Bernice to be nicer to God. Jackie is perplexed that people get old and die. Hyde eyes the ring on Bernice's finger. Fez is horrified to find a body in the casket. Red cant say anything.

Red finds a train set in Bernice's things and fights Marty for it (even though it belonged to Marty). Marty wants Red to admit that he wants the trains, but Red is only willing to show that by keeping the trains that he is doing a favor to Marty. Marty leaves the train set for Red as he loves playing with it. Eric admits to Red his last words to his Grandmom and Red laughs it off saying ""It could only happen to you son"". Kitty finally mourns for Bernice when she runs out of eggs and flour.

Jackie catches a cold from the reservoir and ends up in bed. Kelso is horrified at her ill appearance and turns away from her. But later Kelso apologizes to Jackie saying that this illness is temporary and soon she will be hot and pretty, just like her mom (which also gives him hope for the future). Kelso is convinced that Jackie's physical beauty will last forever.

Midge's Feminist Warriors - which no other husband puts up with - decide to meet at Midge's place every week. The group keeps making Midge crazy with their anti-male talk. Midge points out the female suppression in the English language with words like mail-man. Midge calls Bob a part of the problem. Yet member Sharon actually proves an old-fashioned caring housewife at heart when she finds good provider Bob feeling neglected. Sharon says that a hard-working man who provides for his family, deserves to come home to a hot meal, and not eat a cold sandwich by himself. Bob starts developing feelings for Sharon and animosity towards Midge, which Donna picks up on. Donna sees that Bob is all dressed up in his finest suits whenever Sharon is supposed to visit the house.

Red feels that with the car plant about to close, money is too tight even to afford pork chops. Yet Kitty and Eric implicitly expect him to play ""Santa Claus"" for home-wrecked Hyde after his mother abandons him. It starts with Eric asking Red if Hyde can stay over for the night.

The house is a mess, with garbage everywhere and no furniture to speak of. Kitty tells Red that she cannot allow Hyde to live like this. Red is reluctant as he doesn't have the money. Kitty starts to cry and Red cannot stand it anymore. He orders Hyde to get his stuff in the car. Hyde is angry at Eric since now Red yells at him all the time and back home, Hyde didn't have to answer to anybody.

He is no longer 'admired' by the other boys as the perfect bad example. Hyde works hard and takes pride in what he does. Kelso and Fez lose all respect for him.

Donna and Eric no longer have a place to make out since Hyde has to do his homework. Kitty was disappointed in Hyde when he is failing his class, and Hyde promises to try harder.

Eric's initial happiness with the brother he never had soon turns in frustration as Hyde constantly gets high praise and is even set as an example for Eric, while Eric is now kid no. 3. Since Hyde does all the work around the house, Red only pays him and Eric gets nothing. Hyde scores a C- on his history paper and is applauded. Eric gets a B and is scolded for not getting an A. Eric is asked to be more like Hyde. When Eric confronts Hyde, Hyde calls him a lazy, spoiled brat. Eric says that he has been doing the chores for 16 years and Hyde is making him look bad.

Eric listens to one of Kelso's worst-advised ideas... He sets about coercing Hyde to do destructive things. Instead, Eric ends up bouncing a bowling ball off the couch and breaks the TV, despite Hyde begging him not to do so as nothing good can come off it. Kelso and Fez run away pronto. Hyde tries to cover for Eric, but Red punishes them both by asking them to get a job and buy him a new TV. Red wants a brand new model with a remote and a 26 inch screen.

Fights between Midge and Bob get worse. Midge wants Bob to do the dishes, but Bob says that the feminist philosophy has gone to her head. Bob warns Eric that Donna is likely to turn out the same way. Jackie advice Donna that she can play off Bob and Midge for her affections and come out ahead. She can have twice as much stuff, twice as many clothes and her parents will fight over who gets to buy her a car. Donna is worried that her parents might end up being divorced.

Red's fellow Korea veteran Bull (Mitch Pileggi) is in Point Place, showing off to him and Bob as a success in business selling hot tubs with a young, attractive wife. Bull even offers Red a job since he is opening up a Hot Tub store in Point Place. Red, jealous of Bull's success, reconsiders his life choices, but changes his mind after Bull and his wife (Arlene Pileggi) invite Red and Kitty to a swingers party. Bob and Midge are also invited and Sharon is also there with her husband. When Kitty finds out she asks Red to leave.

Michael finds his brother G.O.B. and asks for his check for the party, to which G.O.B. responds that he will be performing the Aztec Tomb illusion at the party and suggests Michael charge the party to the company's credit card. He then lets slip that their sister Lindsay has been charging her month-long visit to the city to the company.

Michael visits his mother Lucille at her apartment and confronts her about using the company credit card on Lindsay. He learns that the company has also paid $16,000 for the Aztec Tomb and $40,000 to Lindsay's anti-circumcision charity H.O.O.P.. Lindsay and her husband Tobias Fünke arrive at Lucille's apartment and Michael gives them all an impassioned speech about the virtue of hard work.

At the retirement party aboard the Marina Hornblower George decides to name Lucille president of the company, and quietly apologizes to Michael. Michael makes the decision to move him and his son to Arizona away from his family's self-delusions and selfishness when the SEC raids the party and takes George into custody. Buster, Michael's younger brother and perpetual graduate student, attempts to steer the boat to freedom but suffers from a panic attack.

The family gathers at the police station where they learn George will be kept in custody and all accounts have been frozen. The family reacts to the latter. Lucille names Buster to be acting president of the Bluth company but he suffers another panic attack. The family, tired of attempting to find other work, asks Michael to come back and help run the company. Michael realizes they legitimately need his help and that his son would be better off with more family in his life, so he agrees to stay.

George Michael and Maeby While working at the banana stand, a Bluth family operation since the 1950s, George Michael is approached by Mae ""Maeby"" Fünke, his cousin that he rarely sees. She suggests they make out at the retirement party to teach Lindsay a lesson about keeping them separated. George Michael expresses fear that it is illegal.

At the party, Maeby grabs George Michael and kisses him as Lindsay passes. Lindsay doesn't notice and Maeby sulks off. George Michael, however, is aroused by the kiss and begins to struggle with feelings toward his cousin. He becomes incredibly uncomfortable when he learns that he and Maeby will be sharing a bedroom in the model home.

Tobias's piracy Ever since Tobias lost his psychiatrist license after performing C.P.R. on a sleeping man he had been searching for a new life calling. When Michael jokingly suggested the retirement party was pirate themed, Tobias took it seriously. He dressed in Lindsay's clothes and accidentally boarded a boat with some gay men to protest the yacht club's refusal to let gays marry at sea. He befriended the men and realized he wanted to be an actor."

George Michael tries to find time away from Maeby so Michael makes him manager of the Banana Stand. When Michael finds his family lying around the model home he decides that Maeby should work at the Banana Stand to avoid becoming lazy. At the Banana Stand, Maeby regrets her decision and convinces George Michael to take some money from the register to go play ske-ball.

Michael heads over to his mother's apartment to ask her about the location of the flight records. She refuses to tell him but he later thinks of a ruse to get Lucille to lead him to the records: he warns her of an IRS audit on her furs. Lucille has Luz take all her furs to the storage unit where the flight records are kept. Michael tracks Luz and finds out T-Bone has burned the unit down.

Michael is confronted by G.O.B., who wants to be given some responsibilities. Michael asks him to mail a single letter. Michael then heads back to prison to make a stand against his father, who tells him ""there's always money in the Banana Stand"". The next day T-Bone begins working at the Banana Stand, as hired by George Sr., so Maeby and George Michael take off to have lunch. At the restaurant, George Michael realizes they are doubling their losses by throwing away bananas for every dollar they take and begins to panic.

Michael then finds T-Bone at the Banana Stand and heads to the beach to clear his head. Michael then receives a call from Maeby, warning that George Michael is about to burn down the Banana Stand. He agrees to help him as a sign of defiance against George Sr. While they watch it burn, Michael asks G.O.B. if he has mailed the stand's insurance check. G.O.B. had hurled it into the sea, and flees Michael on his Segway.

Michael cockily eats an ice cream sandwich at prison and tells his father that the Banana Stand has been burned down. George becomes angry, and tells Michael there was $250,000 lining the walls of the Banana Stand.

Tobias heads out into the world to find an audition. Michael shows him a flier for an open casting call for a ""fire sale"" TV advertisement. Tobias auditions for the ad as if it were a real fire. When the casting director Roger Danish sees Lindsay's reaction to the sale, he gives her the part. Lindsay celebrates her new job and Tobias is seen crying in the shower. Lucille takes her daughter out to lunch, and the two make jabs at each other throughout the lunch.

The next day, Linsday oversleeps and misses the ad taping. Tobias misses his call from Roger Danish because he was crying in the shower again."

Buster is later put in charge of building a bicycle for George Michael. He forgot to install breaks, however, and crashes when he takes it out for a ride with Michael. A lonely and bitter Lucille returned to the office to get Buster but Michael said that Buster was doing fine without her. Buster then stood up for himself and told Michael that he liked living with his mother. He then firmly told his mother that he would sit in the front seat, a small but significant act of independence from his mother.

When Maeby tells her father that she is auditioning for her school's rendition of Much Ado About Nothing he becomes jealous. Turns out she is just trying out for a chance to kiss Steve Holt. George Michael also tries out for a chance to kiss Maeby. Tobias asks to be the director of the play and subsequently struggles with creative decisions.

At home, Lindsay tries to find an excuse to purchase a new dress. Her mother and Michael tell her to find a job but she becomes determined to cheat the system by hiding the dress in the attic. Tobias finds it and makes it a part of his play.

Maeby quits, annoyed with her father. Tobias gives her female lead role to Steve, assuming George Michael is gay and interested in kissing the jock. George Michael quickly drops his male lead role and it is bequeathed to Maeby. The show opens and Maeby kisses Steve Holt, but doesn't find it pleasant because he is dressed and smells like Lindsay.

He is so taken aback by her beauty and strong moral code that he falls in love with her at the awards show.

In prison, G.O.B. angers a fellow inmate White Power Bill and embarrasses his father. When G.O.B. decides it is time to pass the key he has ingested he can't go to the bathroom without privacy. He calls Michael to get him to use the stair car to escape prison, but Michael shows up on his bike. Michael decides that he doesn't need G.O.B.'s blessing to pursue Marta but when he tries to open up his heart she receives a call that G.O.B. has been stabbed. He had been playing his first game of catch with George, Sr. to make up for a childhood of being ignored by his father when Bill stabbed G.O.B. in the back.

They all rush to the hospital where G.O.B. recommits himself to Marta and Michael is too good of a guy to get in the way. When he is alone, G.O.B. realizes he has ""made a huge mistake"".

Lindsay, upset that the new family car is the stair car, is asked by Michael to get an activist named Johnny Bark out of a tree so the Bluth Company can resume construction.
