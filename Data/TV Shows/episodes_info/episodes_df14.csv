Faced with destruction, Lee personally prepares a cannon and fires at the enemy commander, causing him to sink Lee's ship, the Ivory Web without hesitation. The Web leans over and threatens to take the British ship with it by way of the rigging, but Horatio's men cut it free. As the Web sinks, Lee stands by the descending crow's nest and promises that ""In life or death, no one shall have with is Black Jack Lee's."" In Bermuda, an exploratory oil diving ship is conducting an expedition with two divers combing the sea floor. They divers find the wreck of The Ivory Web as a thick fog rolls over the ship; a pirate vessel emerges with Black Jack Lee commanding. The oil ship is quickly boarded and a technician accidentally turns off the hot water to the divers after being assaulted. The captain struggles to pull them up, but Black Jack Lee smashes his sword into the device, dooming them to death below. Days later, the captain visits Dr. Benton Quest at the Quest Compound to discuss the incident. Dr. Quest pulls a file from British naval records, showing that John Milton Lee was a British privateer born of an aristocratic family who became cruel and ruthless on the seas. Benton doubts that an actual ghost attacked the boat, but notes that the wreck would be a historic find and agrees to explore. He finds Jonny Quest and Hadji Singh, practicing Yoga atop the lighthouse, and asks them to come along. They take the Questor catamaran to the site, and with Race Bannon, Hadji, and Jonny aboard, the Sea Slug begins descending to the sea floor while Dr. Quest and Jessie Bannon control it from above. The wreck is in sight, though perched precariously near a canyon. Jonny and Race investigate; as they enter the ruins, fog suddenly rolls in and the Questor comes under attack. Dr. Quest and Jessie are abducted, and the pirates damage the Questor's computer systems. Hot water is gone for the Sea Slug and Jonny and Race's diving suits, prompting them to make their way back to the diving bell as quickly as possible. Jonny's cord is tangled with the sea floor; Race moves in to save him, but in the process looses a piece of debris, which knocks him out. Jonny struggles to carry Race back, and Hadji drops the recovery hook. Jonny fastens it to Race's suit, and hangs on to Race as they're pulled up. At the top, he passes out and loses his grip, but Hadji quickly grabs his hand and pulls him in. One slap across the face later, and Jonny wakes up in time for Hadji to pull the emergency retrieve lever. Back on the Questor, the team cannot find Benton or Jessie, and Jonny decides to take the Questor's Whaler to a weather station on Goblin Cay for help. He hits a reef while sailing, and the engine dies. Expecting rescue from an oncoming ship, he bails after seeing pirates fast approaching. He feigns helplessness while standing on a reef, and lures the pirate motorboat into hitting the rock and erupting in flames. He swims to a small island nearby, and turns around after making landfall to see Black Jack Lee, who knocks him unconscious. He awakes in the hold of a ship, and remembering what Hadji said to him at the lighthouse, slips out of his ropes. He eavesdrops on several men in conference, who declare that they will use Dr. Quest and his sea craft to remove the treasure, then eliminate him and the rest of his team. Jonny slips through corridors to find Jessie and Dr. Quest, and the three go to the bridge to locate the fog machinery and other ship controls. Dr. Quest activates the theatrical devices, and then chops through a moon pool to flood the ship. The Black Jack Lee impostor arrives and challenges Dr. Quest, who tells Jonny and Jessie to flee. Benton breaks away from the fight, but the impostor is close behind with the axe. The crew begin to abandon ship, and as the recording of Lee's speech plays on the failing equipment, the vessel sinks beneath the sea in a fireball. The next day, Dr. Quest and the team try again to visit the wreck with Jonny and Jessie leading. As they approach, the ship slips off the edge of the gorge and falls to the murky depths of the ocean. Jonny spots the figure of Black Jack Lee, still hanging on to the crow's nest with an axe triumphantly in hand."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049286/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"An old enemy falls victim to his own weapon, a nerve gas, which threatens to leak out of his lab and destroy others.",[],TV-PG,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],"['flashback', 'year 1978', 'chicago illinois', 'nerve gas']",[],"In Chicago during 1978, Race Bannon is handling the threat of Jeremiah Surd, who has lost his government funding and is threatening to unleash deadly nerve as upon the city if he does not receive two million dollars. Phone call negotiations allow Race's team to trace Surd's location to Pier 27; he responds with a SWAT team to board Surd's ship. Surd sends his guards to deal with the attackers; Lorenzo takes down a helicopter with a rocket launcher while Julia tangles with Race. He runs out of ammo, and uses a knife to cut a rope holding a net which falls on her. Lorenzo challenges him next, but Race swings across the room and boots him into a stack of crates. He reaches Surd, who laughs that the nerve gas is in the city, not on the ship. Race lays down his gun and suggests working out a deal, when suddenly soldiers drop in from above and shoot Surd in the leg. Feeling betrayed, Surd lunges for the controls, but a soldier shoots him in the neck despite Race's objections and causing his apparent death. In the present day, construction workers are demolishing an old building when Surd's nerve gas is released, killing five of them within minutes. Commander Bennett contacts Race at the Quest Compound, informing him of the release and pointing to a large dome behind him housing the gas. He asks him to take the case of containment and supervision, and Race reluctantly agrees, flying to Illinois with Dr. Quest on the Quest Jet. Race and Dr. Quest don hazmat suits and make their way in, accidentally tripping a laser sensor in the process. The booby-trap shuts the doors and releases more gas while starting a twenty-four hour timer. Bennett warns that their suits will only keep them safe for twenty two hours; Dr. Quest meanwhile asks Hadji to pull up schematics on the building for Surd's files, but he cannot find anything. Jonny Quest then proposes that Surd might still be alive, and he, Hadji, and Jessie Bannon get to work searching official records. The search turns up nothing until Jessie notices that a hospital transfer record is dated 1979, whereas Surd seemingly died in 1978. The team head out on a rowboat to the Belle Isle Institute of the Insane, and devise a plan to cut the power during a lightning strike to allow covert entry. They find a paralyzed Surd, who deduces that they are there to plead for the lives of Dr. Quest and Race. They bribe his help with a tantalizing sample of Questworld, which undoes his immobility; they promise more at the Compound if they have a deal. Surd agrees, and runs rampant through Questworld, eventually disappearing from Hadji's monitor. He phones Julia, asking her to contact Lorenzo and declaring that they're ""back in business"". The team see the phone call and pull him out of Questworld; he tells the team to cut the third purple wire in a certain conduit, but doing so causes an explosion. The lighthouse is this ransacked by a tear gas canister. Two assailants burst in and carry Surd out, stealing the portable Questworld unit in the process. Dr. Quest and Race reestablish contact; Race has a tear in his suit, but Dr. Quest tapes it up before any nerve gas gets in. The team realize that Surd will soon log on to Questworld again, and prepare to intercept him in cyberspace. As Jonny and Jessie enter, they quickly find out that Surd has as much power over the world as they do, and two flashes of light circle around them (burning Jessie's arm in the process). Surd refuses to let Hadji remove them from Questworld, causing the yogin to pull a system component from the lighthouse computer. Jessie is shocked to find a real burn on her arm; Surd has apparently programmed cyberspace to inflict physical harm. As Benton and Race face a four hour time limit, the team decide to go hot again despite Surd's display of power; they find themselves in a ""fun house"" he built. Jonny loads a power sled, and speeds away after arming a sonic detonator. Surd tries to find it, but ends up smashing its reflection in several mirrors. He's pulled out of Questworld shortly before the explosion, and the team track him on Interstate 95 through a system back door. They find him at a truck stop with four wheelers and sneak in; Lorenzo pulls a gun, but they take cover behind Surd (who risks being shot). Surd agrees to help them as he has no choice; the decision comes down to one wire. Jonny tells Benton to cut the orange, while Race thinks it's a trap and wants him to cut the blue. As it comes down to one second, Benton cuts the blue, causing a minor explosion. The teens jump out of the truck, which speeds away; via a cell phone, they hear that Dr. Quest and Race are okay."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0683578/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,The team searches for a missing man and stumbles across the lost city of El Dorado.,[],TV-PG,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Deep in a South American jungle, many years ago, an ornithologist runs from armed natives dressed in tribal regalia. He accidentally drops his compass and continues down a path to a massive culvert, replete with bird-head aqueducts lining its stone walls. As he mutters to himself, the native warriors approach from behind; the camera pans to a vista, leaving his fate unknown In the Quest Compound laboratory, Estella Scheele begs Dr. Benton Quest to investigate the case of her grandfather, the man depicted in the teaser. She presents his compass as evidence of his survival in the Peruvian jungle, but Dr. Quest brushes the request aside, even after she reveals he had discovered a new species of condor. Jonny Quest enters with Bandit, and the team retire to the library to view Estella's tape. Dr. Quest is still unconvinced, prompting Estella to present a golden archaeological artifact allegedly from no known site. She departs and Benton analyzes the piece in the laboratory; he's stunned to find it's possibly two or three thousand years old, and connected to Chavín culture, a supernatural cult from antiquity. Once Dr. Quest links the artifact to an illustration produced by the culture, the team decide to set off and find the culture's main city, said to be built of gold. After arriving in the rain forest, the group find a pair of golden totems sticking out of a tributary of the Rio de Las Piedras, which scare away the local guides. The team continue on raft while Dr. Quest attempts to fix their position by satellite. The gentle river turns to rapids, and the raft careens out of control as Race tries to stabilize it by firing a piton gun towards an old tree. The brittle, dead tree breaks, sending the raft down two waterfalls. All survive, and make camp; Estella, Jonny, and Hadji talk by the campfire. Cries of help soon echo off the nearby cliff, and Jonny finds a anaconda strangling a native boy. He beats the anaconda away with a stick, but the boy escapes as a condor menacingly flies overhead. The next day, the team prepare to climb the nearby cliff; Race decides to lead, with Hadji behind, and Estella, Jonny, and Dr. Quest serving as the anchor. Midway up, the team are attacked by condor; Race tries to shoot it while Benton prepares to be the climbing anchor. Hadji falls first, but is secured by his safety line. Jonny then falls, but his safety line is pulled out by the condor before he can reach a safe ledge. With only one more peg holding him up, Jonny tries to regain control, but plummets after it too falls out of the cliff. Jonny is brought to safety on the ledge by a pair of native arms. The condors continue to harass the team, but mysteriously fly away after a shrill call fills the air. Race diverts the group to the ledge that Jonny landed on, and inside they find the skeleton of Estella's grandfather with a ""Scheele"" camera. Estella seems unfazed and continues, while the others express doubts about her sincerity. Further inside, the team inspect a stone door while Estella tries to move a heavy golden artifact. Her removal triggers a mechanism that opens the door, revealing the lost city of gold, El Dorado, marked with a massive statue of a condor around which a flock of the birds fly. Dr. Quest realizes that the only way to and from the city is via the condors, and he, Race, and Hadji spot Jonny being honored with a quill for saving the native from the anaconda. The natives speak with a combination of words and clicks. Estella busies herself with chipping gold from a massive statue, creating an uproar and the imprisonment of the team. Dr. Quest and the others chide Estella for her actions; she claims she never cared about her grandfather, and is consumed with lust for the city's gold. They realize the floor of the cell is a trap door leading to feasting condors below, but a native boy uncovers an alcove in the wall from outside and leads the team through the city to escape. Estella fakes a fall to take the native boy hostage; the other natives realize, and come forward in confrontation. Their leader asks the return of the boy in English, but Estella takes up a position on a high walkway. Jonny follows with a golden object, which he throws to Estella before tackling her. The two tumble off the walkway; Jonny holds on with his hand, but Estella falls to her death face-first. Jonny falls soon after, but the leader of the natives calls forth the condors to rescue him. The leader reveals himself as Professor Scheele, and the native boy as his grandson, denying any relation to Estella. On top of the cliffs, he summons the condors to take the Quest team back to civilization, understanding that the secret of the lost city will remain."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0683587/?ref_=ttep_ep4,,The team searches for a way to stop an apocalyptic preacher and his apostles from ending the world.,[],TV-PG,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"As footage of an erupting volcano and other analytical scenes air, a scientist describes that the eruption of Mt. Pentium in the Philippines has released ""Pentium molecules"" that act as chlorofluorocarbons, degrading the ozone layer. The scientist elaborates that the Pentium molecule cannot be manufactured, but a substitute B-765 molecule can. Ezekiel Rage watches pensively as the scientist, Brother James, reveals that B-765 could irreparably damage the ozone layer. James further explains that the molecule can only be replicated in zero gravity. Meanwhile, at Cape Canaveral, Dr. Quest and Hadji launch on a space shuttle to see how muon-scattering is affected by zero gravity while Jessie, Jonny, and Race watch from mission control. Aboard the shuttle, the astronaut named ""Reed"" is secretly Ezekiel Rage. The shuttle discards main boosters and prepares for orbit; Captain Spencer tells Reed to perform some duties in the back of the shuttle. Rage takes off his helmet in the rear and rips communication wires to black out the shuttle to mission control, then commandeers the craft. Back on earth, a black news van speeds towards the launch center; a disciple of Rage pops out of the top and blasts the gate with a bazooka, heading for the auxiliary shuttle. Race runs out as the NASA guards fail to stop the van. Though he's able to cause the van to wreck, the bazooka-wielding brother successfully disables the shuttle. Mission control is then locked down as several of Rage's agents stage a coup. Race attempts to interrogate the van's driver outside, but Commander Bennett arrives and informs Race of the shuttle's hijacking. Ezekiel Rage delivers an address to the world, and Bennett reveals that he's planning to borrow a Russian shuttle-if Race will convince them to through an old flame, Natasha Rostova. As Rage coordinates with his men to land at an abandoned space station, Race pilots an SR-71 Blackbird en route to another shuttle. Jonny and Jessie meanwhile try to evade Rage's agents by going through an air vent. Race meets with Natasha, and after a slap and kiss, asks for access to a Russian shuttle. An agent of Rage then fires upon Jonny in the air vent at Cape Canaveral. Jessie pulls Jonny to relative safety from the laser blasts, while Rage docks the shuttle at the abandoned space station. Captain Spencer engages the shuttle self-destruct card, which Dr. Quest hides under his leg. Jonny and Jessie evade their pursuer and find the NASANet computer conduit; they plan to hack open the blast doors. In space, Rage successfully synthesizes the B-765 molecule and injects it into a small globe. As he gloats, Dr. Quest taunts him, and the shuttle explodes, severing part of the space station's ring superstructure. Jonny and Jessie meanwhile cobble together a computer, which they use to hack open the doors as Race's shuttle approaches the station. Rage fills a small vial with the molecule, then floats to a docking arm with a laser rifle. Race and Natasha sneak around him, and Race engages in physical combat. Rage jumps to the dock, hoping to use the Russian shuttle to unleash the molecule; Race taunts him, revealing he had stolen the vial. As Rage reaches for his pistol, Natasha shoots him with a laser rifle. The team file back into the shuttle, as the station's orbit is decaying; Race attempts to subdue Rage, who flies away with rocket-powered boots. As the team descend in the shuttle, Rage prepares more molecule, but accidentally shatters the globe due to turbulence. As he screams, the station crashes into the ocean, and his mask floats across screen."

Two men in the jeep tail the elephant, and one downs it with a shot from his rifle. The elephant struggles to stand, but the hunter kills it with a second shot. As the hunter stands over his quarry, his aide leaves the jeep and revs a chainsaw to cut off the elephant's ivory tusks. Jonny, Race, and Dr. Quest tear across the Serengeti in a Quest Rover, armed with cameras. They drive astride a pack of gazelles and take several pictures. The gazelles enter a forested area, so Dr. Quest tries to cut around the watering hole and rejoin the pack. Along the way, they stop and find the dead elephant, resolving to notify the game rangers. Rumbling is heard from the nearby watering hole, and Race orders the group back into the jeep. A massive elephant emerges and gores the jeep, knocking it into a large tree; the group climb up as the elephant completely destroys the vehicle. Jonny takes several pictures, but falls; the elephant runs up to kill him, but suddenly freezes in placidity as Jonny's reflection appears in his eye. A cloud of dust envelops the elephant, which seems to become a Masai elder; he informs Jonny that the elephant, Ndovu, recognized him as a spirit he knew and the past and selected him to accompany his journey to the burial ground of his ancestors. The Masai describes the prophecy of white men who bring hunger and guns, and ruminates that Ndovu chose Jonny as a friendly spirit among white people. That night, Race repairs the Quest Rover while Jonny tries to convince Hadji and Jessie to go with him to track Ndovu. The three agree and set out, laying out sleeping bags near a watering hole after making distance. In the morning, Ndovu wakes them with blasts of water from his trunk, while Race and Benton discover the three have left. Ndovu sets out towards the graveyard, but Jonny nearly falls into a spiked pit in pursuit. He discovers the poachers riding towards Ndovu through his viewfinder, and the three re-cover the spiked pit in hopes the poachers will fall into it. The plan succeeds, throwing the hunter from the vehicle and nearly knocking the driver unconscious; the hunter decides to continue on foot. Dr. Quest and Race meanwhile drive in search of their progeny. Ndovu swims through a pond, but Jonny, Jessie, and Hadji realize the hunter has launched a small boat and is taking aim. They swim underneath the boat and overturn it as Ndovu reaches the far bank. That evening, the three watch the plains from a rocky outcropping; a Tanzanian border patrol convoy speeds to their position after their scout assumes they're poachers. The patrol realizes they're just kids and makes camp with the intent to return them to their parents the following day. However, the hunter surrounds their position with gasoline and starts a huge fire. The fire engulfs the camp, setting several of the Tanzanian border patrol guards on fire as they try to stamp it out. Jonny, Jessie, and Hadji help smother the flames where they can. Dr. Quest and Race blow through the wall of flames in the Quest Rover, and all parties load up in vehicles to escape. The following day, the border patrol officer thanks Dr. Quest, but admonishes the kids to leave the matter of the poacher to them. The Quests resume their photography drives, but Jonny spots the Masai man pointing across the plains, and Hadji is able to convince Dr. Quest with a wise quip to resume the tracking of Ndovu. Jonny, Jessie, and Hadji jump out to follow the elephant through thick growth, but the Quest Rover breaks down when Race and Benton try to follow. Jonny and the others stumble into the elephant's graveyard, filled with ivory and skeletons; Race and Dr. Quest also enter-led at gunpoint by the poachers. They hit Race and prepare to execute the Quest family, but Ndovu appears from behind amd proceeds to kill both poachers by trampling the driver and throwing the hunter on elephant tusks and getting impaled, Ndovu then collapses; Jonny runs to his side and cries as Ndovu wraps his trunk around him. The Quest team depart the following day, resolving to keep the secret of the graveyard. Hadji postulates that the Masai and Ndovu were one and the same as a vision of them bids them farewell."

He finishes as he hears something sneaking up behind, and whirling around discovers a simple feral cat, which screeches and runs away. A darker presence still lurks, making low growling sounds. Before he can react, a white tiger pounces on the man, swiping his rifle away. He attempts to run, but is soon killed by the beast. Jonny and Hadji are in New York City with Dr. Quest, who brought them along on the condition that Jonny undertake urban studies-which he finds boring in comparison to a tabloid reporting the death of the man, the fourth victim of the ""city slayer"". The next day, Vince Vance, a sleazy tabloid reporter, is on the scene and after accidentally being caught with a stylist offers a $25,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the slayer. Jonny leaps at the opportunity with Hadji close behind, but a portly police officer blocks them. Looking for another way in, Jonny and Hadji pick up the cable of a camera being moved by one of Vance's program's camera men. The producer of Vince's show is sweating him over the sizable reward when Vance catches sight of the two. Hadji makes a save by telling Vance that they're his fans, and Hadji overhears an officer say that the slayer must be an animal. That night, he puts the pieces of the crime scene together in a dream, wakes up, and finds that the midpoint of each murder site is Grand Central Station. He wakes Jonny, and the two head down to the subways. They descend to unused, catacomb like passages while unknowingly tailed by the white tiger. In a cavernous room, they are assaulted by homeless with pipes and chains, but are able to escape when the tiger turns on their attackers. It nearly attacks them as well, but a subway overhead scares it away. The next day, Dr. Quest holds a press conference in Central Park to announce the tiger's presence. He explains that the causes and methods of death confirm that the tiger was responsible for the recent murders. Vance jestingly asks Hadji (""the kid with the towel"") if he has some kind of mystic connection with the tiger before a helicopter flies overhead. A solemn hunter descends, and Vance declares that his show has a contract with the hunter to kill the ""Manhattan maneater"" for all to see. Jessie Bannon and Race watch from the Quest Compound, and Race responds positively to Jessie's implied suggestion that they join their friends in New York, betting that Benton will need his help sooner or later. That night, Vance reveals that the tiger escaped a convicted drug lord's estate, and that the contract with the hunter is now worth $100,000, available to anyone else if he or she beats him to the punch. Three thugs and many more across the city decide to pursue the cat for the prize money. Dr. Quest is outraged, and at a diner with Hadji and Jessie, Jonny expresses feelings of regret for alerting everyone to the tiger. He decides to finish what he's started by wrangling the beast himself, and the three set out in Central Park, where a strange man appears. The man is simply a street peddler, and the team wave him off before being confronted by the three thugs. Intending to mug them, one realizes that Jonny and Hadji were on TV, and note that the team are going to find the tiger for them and make them rich. Benton and Race go to the police to report Jonny and the gang as missing, but they refuse to issue the order until a certain time period has passed. The thugs, led by Karl, prepare to descend into the subway as Dr. Quest and Race take to the skies in the Quest Helicopter to monitor all telephone or cellular phone calls to find Jonny (presuming he can get to a phone). The search party finds the tiger, which lunges at Hadji. He ducks out of the way, and Jonny taunts it, luckily provoking it to jump into a pit. Karl calls Vance to report that he's got the tiger; he hands the phone to Jonny to verify, and Jonny tries to plead that Vance call his father. Karl rips the phone away and asks Vance that there be no cops, money in cash, and the right to keep the body after the tiger dies. Vance agrees, and Dr. Quest tracks the phone call to their location beneath the subway. Inside, the thugs have left temporarily to find Vance, and the team throw down a grate to allow the tiger to escape. When Karl returns with Vance, cameramen, and the hunter, he threatens Jonny for letting the tiger free. However, the white beast is still close, and the hunter and a spotlight technician prepare their aim. The tiger perches atop an arch as Vance reports live that the shot is about to occur. Suddenly, Karl has a crisis of conscience and stands in front of the hunter. Jonny and others join him, and Vance hits his camera man, whose camera falls and explodes, startling the tiger. A shot rings out, but it was Race with a tranquilizer rifle; he stops the hunter from killing the tiger. The Quests take it to an Indian reserve, and let Karl and his friends release it."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0683570/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,Sea monsters are rumored to be responsible for vanishing ships in the Seychelles.,"['Animation', 'Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Family', 'Sci-Fi']",TV-PG,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"A strange, colorblind creature watches from the sea floor as a submarine propels overhead. The submarine's sonar-man reports the presence of a large entity in close proximity on a collision course as the creature seems to move closer from its point of view. Attempts to contact it fail, and the submarine captain orders a torpedo fired, which briefly stalls the incredible beast. It soon exercises huge tentacles over the submarine, sucking and taking it down to the sea floor where equipment and ballast release mechanisms fail and pressure allows water to rush in. The creature leaves the crew to drown in their stranded submarine. Dr. Quest has been called in to find the missing submarine, and lets Jonny pilot the Questor most of the way in to port at Christie Island in the Republic of Seychelles. Jonny is happy to pilot the ship, and Dr. Quest echoes his fervor by reflecting on what a charmed situation they're in. The next day, a whaler named ""Donder"" pursues a sperm whale in the nearby sea. As it makes a second attempt at harpooning, the ship is rocked and bent by giant tentacles towering over the ship. The tentacles, probably part of a giant squid, wreck the ship and ultimately turn it over, allowing the pursued sperm whale to get away. The captain is rescued, and Dr. Quest, Race Bannon, Jonny and Hadji ask him what capsized his boat. Dr. Quest finds the sea monster story hard to believe, while Jonny is glad that the whalers were wrecked. That evening, Jonny and Hadji take the Small Sailing Catamaran with hopes to circumvent the island. A waterspout descends; Benton suggests taking the outboard motor Whaler to find them, but Race notes that the whaler will be useless in rough waters and suggests using the Questor. Jonny and Hadji helplessly watch the twister approach, and are sucked up. The next day, Dr. Quest argues with the harbormaster about the limited search and rescue capabilities of the island before Race suggests taking the Questor out again to search. Jonny and Hadji recover on the overturned catamaran, which has been all but destroyed save for the two hulls. As Dr. Quest and Race continue searching with the Questor, Jonny and Hadji get on one of the hulls and start paddling. Jonny is fatigued, and Hadji rips his turban in two to give him enough material for a turban of his own. Meanwhile, Dr. Quest and Race are called out to a nearby beach, where they find a sliced off squid tentacle. Dr. Quest is amazed, and estimates that the squid must be at least three-hundred feet long. Jonny and Hadji spot an island, and set out in search of water after landing. On the opposite side, they find a cove full of shipwrecks, including the whaler from before. As they paddle out to the whaler in search of people, a giant tentacle rises from the sea. Only one plane is searching for the boys, much to Benton's disappointment. The giant tentacle threatening them returns beneath the waves when a submarine surfaces; it is the one from before. Crewmen stand on deck with guns and convey Hadji and Jonny to their vessel. The captain explains that the incident happened two years ago, and after he was stranded on the sea floor, whales helped the submarine out of its position, saving it and the lives of those on board. Since then, the submarine has repaid the debt by wrecking whalers with the help of a giant mechanical tentacle they've built. Hadji and Jonny are then confined to quarters, where Hadji worries that they will be held as prisoners forever or executed. Dr. Quest and Benton have taken to the skies with an amphibian aircraft, but still turn up nothing. That night, Hadji fakes a sickness with his yogin training to relax his heartbeat; Jonny cries for help, bringing the captain and medican officer. While they fail to find a pulse, Jonny escapes to the bridge and calls Dr. Quest before stealing the sub's tender, the Zodiac. The doctor tickles Hadji's foot, finding a reflex action and confirming his life. They then hear the Zodiac outside, and Hadji goes on deck to jump on the back and escape. The captain fails to shoot them, instead telling his men to prepare the submarine. The next day, Race and Dr. Quest succeed in finding the now-stranded Zodiac, but as they're about to pick them up the submarine and its giant squid tentacle surface. Fortunately, the real giant squid returns to suck the submarine under once more. The Quests escape, and wondering how anyone would believe such a story, Jonny suggests keeping it secret. They then postulate that the captain is probably still at large, as another whaler is shown being attacked."

The Asian man finds the eagle's egg, which glows when he touches it. The mother eagle returns and transforms into even greater size, dropping the man and the egg off the cliff. He's killed by the impact, but the egg survives the fall and seems to become angular and golden. The eagle carries off the egg, and a narrator explains that it's the Philosopher's Stone, with the power to change any base metal into gold. One thousand years later, Dr. Benton Quest, Hadji Singh, and Dr. Montegue uncover the Philosopher's stone beneath rock and snow in a remote location. Montegue wishes to try its legendary powers out, but Hadji and Dr. Quest feel it belongs in the museum that commissioned their exploration. Some time later, two masked bandits steal the egg-shaped stone from a museum. As the female thief waits for her getaway car, the shadow of an eagle approaches, becoming the form of an old woman who commands her to replace what she has taken. The elderly woman tells her that the power of the stone isn't meant for the material world, but she disappears when the getaway car arrives. The thieves take the egg to Dr. Montegue, who tries it out with loose nuts and bolts. Its activation causes the Asian to appear and warn him that those using the stone who are not pure of heart will be destroyed. Montegue declares that he's only interested in knowledge, not money, causing Dr. Faust to appear and warn him of obsession. Meanwhile, at the museum, Jonny Quest finds a bird feather and sees the eagle's shadow. He climbs the scaffolding to find an old woman who wishes to recruit him for some cause. Jessie Bannon climbs up, and the two go to the roof to follow the old woman after Hadji saves Jessie from falling. Jonny and Jessie see the eagle swoop over the city, and pursue with Hadji on the ground. The eagle leads them to the window of a building; inside, Merlin chides Montegue for his alchemy, but Montegue celebrates when his process produces two bars of pure gold. Jonny, Jessie, and Hadji alert the police, but by the time they arrive, Montegue has departed with his equipment. Some time later, he's shown arriving at a mansion with a massive laboratory for his alchemy; he delivers a soliloquy on the power of gold and money. Merlin and Dr. Faust appear and tell him he's lost his soul and cannot produce more gold, prompting Montegue to plan to capture someone with a pure heart. He calls his two thugs and offers them $2 million to abduct the Quest kids from the Quest Compound. They succeed, and Montegue asks Hadji to run the program while Jonny and Jessie ask for water. Hadji uses the distraction to send an e-mail for help. Montegue threatens to kill Jonny and Jessie, but when Hadji complies with his demand, the stone unleashes the eagle, which starts destroying the lab equipment. The thugs try to kill it, but it splits into several smaller birds, starting a fire and overwhelming Montegue and the thugs. The lab explodes as Jonny, Jessie, and Hadji run to safety."

Something watches with purple eyesight from the trees, and begins picking off the soldiers one by one, seemingly impervious to gunfire. The final soldier flees the scene as the monster chases, appearing to be a large, brown, hairy creature with red eyes and huge claws. The soldier tumbles into a waterfall as the monster watches from the cliff. The Quests fly to Borneo to conduct age research on temples. Jonny and Jessie go fishing, and discover the soldier who fell into the waterfall. Meanwhile, Hadji, Race, and Dr. Quest analyze one of the temples, determining the lower levels were built a thousand years before the higher ones. Race inquires of a relief that seems to depict the monster from the teaser; Dr. Quest considers it an early sloth or a depiction of the goddess Rangda. Jonny and Jessie arrive with the soldier; at camp that night, the soldier lies that he came alone as part of a mission for a charity to recover a downed shipment of antibiotics. Race is skeptical, but Dr. Quest is worried that his story may be true. The monster watches with purple vision from the trees. The following morning, the party sets out on a Quest canoe for the soldier's last position. They embark on land on a precipitous outcropping in driving rain, and Race catches sight of the monster. It jumps out of the jungle and attacks the soldier, who struggles to hold on to the cliff; Dr. Quest aims his gun at the monster, who pauses to look at Quest before retreating. Race descends with a rope to rescue the soldier, and the team makes camp. That night, Jessie receives a transmission in response to a request to Commander Bennett to check out Mitchell Stramm's (the soldier) passport. Bennett's reply reveals that Stramm's real name is James Compton, and that he's a former special forces agent assumed to be killed in action since 1989. Compton realizes the subject of their conversation and escapes with Benton's gun. The monster then attacks as Race tries to round up the fleeing Quests and make a unified escape. Jonny wanders alone, and Jessie and Race come out to join him; no trace exists of Hadji or Dr. Quest. The following day, Jonny is lowered to the river to look for clues, hoisted midway by Jessie and anchored at the top by Race. As Jonny finds his footing at the bottom, growls ring out from above, and the rope Race was holding falls down the cliff. Jonny and Jessie try to climb all the way up, but Jessie falls into the river, pulling Jonny with her. They're sucked into a cave and spat out over a waterfall, but emerge unharmed. The amok monster soon attacks, taking the two to a village where they find the others and the soldiers, who are locked in a bamboo cage. The monster takes off his head to reveal a stocky white man named Swain underneath, and the tribal leader approaches, claiming to be the son of Orde Wingate, famous British major-general of World War II. Wingate faked his death in order to avoid the war, which he felt was being won well enough. Compton interrupts his story with shooting and frees his other soldiers. He explains that he was hired to deal with the amok monster, and Wingate's son adds that this was in order to restore an illicit drug trade in the region. Compton rounds up prisoners in a long house, but Jonny and Swain, in monster regalia, seem to escape. They wait until night and pick off the guards; Swain confronts Compton as Race cleans out the long house. Outside, Swain retreats as Major-General Wingate himself subdues Compton with a bo; Compton flees into the jungle, but cries of pain are heard soon after as he is presumably killed by the real Amok."

The three head back to the Questor due to a growing squall. Beneath the waves, several whales navigate the shallow waters, and one becomes lodged in a net. Jonny spots it from the paraglider, and disengages to plunge into the water and survey the damage. He finds the trapped whale and frees the net from its tail, only to be captured by it as it drifts towards him. He's able to snap the net and swim upwards, but quickly tires and loses consciousness. Jessie and Hadji find his downed parasail, and Jessie goes in once Hadji attaches a lifeline to her vest, the whale pushes Jonny to the surface, where he's rescued by Jessie. Hadji pulls them in, and Jessie gives Jonny CPR until he spits up water and recovers. Some distance away within a container on a barge, Jeremiah Surd, Lorenzo, and Julia begin a Questworld experiment; Surd believes that cetaceans communicate through a ""sonic internet"" and wants to tap into it. In virtual reality, Surd latches on to a whale with his hands, then orders Julia to lower several microphones into the water. Surd is then able to sink completely into the virtual reality whale, achieving control over the marine sonic internet, used by marine life worldwide to communicate. He causes a dolphin to attack and drown an old fisherman, a whale to overturn a yacht, and show dolphins to attack their trainer until the dolphins return to normal due to Surd disengaging from Questworld, and Lorenzo and Julia celebrate by offering the idea of killing the Quests, who are on vacation in Hawaii. Dr. Quest and Hadji meanwhile ride the whaler out to listen for cetacean sounds, while Jonny and Jessie discover an underwater cave. The previously-trapped whale that Jonny saved is nearby, and allows Jonny and Jessie to ride its fin. Surd approaches in the barge, and deploys the microphone, orchestrating an attack on the whaler by a pod of dolphins Dr. Quest had been observing. Hadji and Dr. Quest notice an immediate change in behavior as Hadji picks up the signal in his headphones. The dolphins knock a hole in the hull, and Hadji steers it to shore. The whale with Jonny and Jessie attacks them underwater, splitting them up. Jonny runs out of air and surfaces, but Jessie is unaccounted for, her scuba equipment sitting on the ocean floor in tatters. The whaler reaches Jonny, who requests a fresh air tank to search for Jessie. In the underwater cave, Jessie surfaces and finds a discarded plastic jug, which she puts a piece of her clothing in (while the whale notices her) and lets surface as a sign of life. Jonny sets out from the Questor in a jetski, while Dr. Quest takes to the skies in the Minichopper. Jonny finds the discarded jug, and escapes the pursuing whales by grabbing the Minichopper's pontoon. Back on the Questor, Dr. Quest contacts Race, who's five hours from their position in the PBY Catalina. Dr. Quest asks Race to track down Captain Havell (from East of Zanzibar), while Hadji tracks the strange sound signals to Surd's ship off the coast of Madagascar. Later that day, Dr. Quest creates a diversion for the whales by piloting the Questor; Jonny and Hadji go beneath the water's surface in the Sea Slug to save Jessie. Jonny sets out in scuba gear and finds her in the cave, but the whale smash the Questor's starboard hull above. Race is able to locate Captain Havell, giving him Surd's sonic signature and promising that he'll owe a huge favor. Jonny, Jessie, and Hadji try to escape pursuing whales in the Sea Slug, but eventually surface the vessel and abandon ship. Near Madagascar, Captain Havell finds Surd's barge and fires a torpedo. The barge is immediately disabled and starts to sink amidst fires and explosions; Surd narrowly escapes as a Chinook helicopter launches and uses a magnetic detachment to pull away the Questworld equipment container. The whales cease their harassment of the Quests, and at sunset, the team reunite with Race and express thanks for Havell's intervention."

Hadji reads about the descendants of redcoats in the area, while Dr. Quest explains the legend-that a woman in the area had twelve children and wished that if she had a thirteenth, it'd be a devil. The devil had been blamed for the abductions of children for two centuries. Hadji suddenly picks up something on the Queststream's infrared scanners, and Dr. Quest puts the motor home into overdrive as he exits the highway. The holographic projector in the vehicle seems to show the Jersey Devil, and Dr. Quest pushes 90 mph in pursuit. A log in the road forces Dr. Quest to take evasive maneuvers, and the Queststream slides out of control down a steep bank of snow. A sturdy tree stops the Queststream from plunging off a cliff. Jonny, Hadji, Dr. Quest, and Bandit exit, and Hadji swears he saw the Jersey Devil. Bandit catches sight of it and pursues with Jonny in tow. The devil perches on a downed log and faces Jonny, but two revolutionary era-clothed old people scare it away with old rifles. They take the Quests back to their house and give Dr. Quest an object, asking if he brought something in trade. The old woman threatens him with a rifle; Dr. Quest plays along, and the woman says Commander Washington told them they were coming. Dr. Quest opens the cover and finds the original Declaration of Independence. The woman explains that her ancestors heard about the Declaration, and shot the messenger who was to deliver it to scribes after its original authoring. The ancestor, Rodney, demanded a ransom of 12,000 pounds sterling to be delivered in the pines for the return of the Declaration. Their revolutionary contact agrees, saying the ransom will be delivered by a bearded messenger in a silver coach. After Rodney leaves, the revolutionary orders one of his soldiers to pursue him to the ransom point and kill him, and orders another to have a scribe created a new Declaration of Independence with forged signatures. Back in the present, the descendants of the involved parties are still awaiting the ransom. As they threaten to kill Dr. Quest for not bringing the ransom, a cry from the Jersey Devil echoes outside. The Quests use the diversion to try and escape, in Jonny grabs the Declaration in the scuffle. Outside, the Jersey Devil swoops down to attack them. Inside, Dr. Quest subdues the other two, stressing to them that he can secure a lot of money for the Declaration and that the war has ended. They're skeptical, but Dr. Quest gives them their rifle as a sign of goodwill. They begin searching for Jonny, Hadji, and Bandit, who scampers back with the empty holster for the document. Dr. Quest realizes that the two genuinely believe that the war's been going on for over 200 years. Jonny and Hadji are meanwhile tied up in a wooden shed, and the devil enters and takes off its mask to reveal a man thinking he's a minuteman from the revolutionary era. He accuses Jonny and Hadji of being redcoats and departs to find others, leaving his wife and two children in charge; his wife's hand bears a peace sign tattoo, marking her as a kidnapped child from the sixties. She begs her husband Josiah Williams to let them live, but he's intent on executing Jonny and Hadji. He takes them out on a cliff, but his rifle fails the first time he tries to fire. Jonny and Hadji try to convince his wife ""Sarah"" that she's really the abducted child from the sixties. She starts to believe and interferes with William's shot, but the cliff Jonny's standing on crumbles. Jonny hangs on below as Hadji unravels his turban for him. Before the Williams can finish the job, the old couple on the British side arrive. Dr. Quest runs between them to try and reason with them, but Sarah hurtles the Declaration over the cliff-side, sparking hostility. In the resulting battle, Sarah takes the bullet for the old man, leading to reconciliation. Dr. Quest, Hadji, Jonny, and Bandit let them return to their homes and camp near the Queststream. Jonny is upset over losing the original declaration, but the scream of the Jersey Devil pierces from the woods, and the sheath and paper are thrown to their camp. Bandit looks into the woods, seeing only pines and darkness."

As the full moon rises, he suddenly turns into a werewolf, destroys the cabin and knocks over a latern, and runs outside. At a nearby cabin, a white woman named Dr. Metier sees to a sick boy with his father. The kid's all right and departs with his father, but the werewolf jumps through the window and attacks her. The werewolf then stops when he sees her medallion, bearing a coat of arms with a wolf's head-a symbol that also appeared on the diary of the old man. The werewolf stops, but the child's father bursts in and shoots the wolf, having heard the doctor's screams; the wolf attacks him before relenting on the doctor's orders. The man wonders why the wolf obeys her, and the wolf unleashes a piercing howl in the moon on distant rocks. Dr. Quest, Race, Jonny, and Hadji soon arrive in the PBY Catalina; Race is skeptical of the wolf story, but immediately hits it off with the doctor. As they discuss inside her home, the child's father from before arrives with a rifle, still incredulous. He swears to kill the wolf and boasts of silver bullets. That night, Marie is woken by the wolf outside the window and leaves her cabin; Bandit barks to wake up Jonny. Outside, Marie confronts the werewolf, who declines to attack her once more. Jonny and the child's father arrive, and Jonny stops the man from making an accurate shot on the wolf. Race hits it with a tranquilizer dart and shadows Tuk, the child's father. The werewolf attacks Tuk, and Race lacks air pressure in his rifle. He clubs the wolf with the rifle's butt and gets into a scuffle; another clubbing sends the werewolf away whimpering. Dr. Quest doubles the tranquilizer dosage the next day while Marie cleans Race's wounds; they kiss that night as Jonny and Hadji watch. Jonny and Race find the burned down house of the old man the next day, and Jonny locates several files on Metier family members inside a file cabinet. As they depart, the partially-transformed werewolf enters and retrieves his diary. Bandit sees him flee and gives chase; Race pursues Bandit, but crashes into a log after sight of the werewolf distracts him. Jonny finds and blankets him as night falls; Race implores Jonny to leave him and find Dr. Quest. Bandit takes off again, and Jonny follows him to find a pack of wolves staring him down Jonny and Bandit run over an icy pond, which cracks and swallows them up. The wolves stand ready to kill the two when they emerge, but the werewolf appears and bats them away. The werewolf then throws his diary to Jonny, asking him to make the serum that can cure him using the book's formulas. The werewolf tells Jonny to run, and he returns to Race; unfortunately, the pack of wolves is waiting for him. He fires a flare into his motorbike, exploding it and scaring away the wolves. Hadji and Benton then find them and take them back to the doctor's house. Dr. Metier explains that her family has long been plagued by a disease that turns the males to werewolves, and that she hadn't believed in the story until witnessing recent events. Professor Metier, the werewolf, was trying to make a serum when he destroyed his laboratory. Dr. Metier and Dr. Quest team up to isolate the recessive gene in the doctor's blood, which can produce the serum. They succeed, and Marie plans to act as bait so they can administer the serum to the werewolf; she gives Race her pendant for good luck. That night, they find the werewolf, but Dr. Metier is mesmerized by him and walks forward; Race can't get a clear shot for the serum. The wolf attacks her, but Jonny rushes and jumps on his back, jamming in a syringe with the serum. The werewolf runs away, and later that night, Tuk enters with an unconscious Professor Metier draped in his jacket , rescued from the mountain having been found naked and half-dead and safely in human form with Hadji quoting, ""fate has a strange nature, you tried to kill him as wolf but it was your destiny to save him as a man."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1109296/?ref_=ttep_ep22,,"On an expedition to find the Yeti, the team finds a scientist bent on taking the monster in dead or alive.",[],TV-PG,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Dr. Benton Quest is in the mountains near Khumbu to track the infamous yeti, a joint venture with one professor Kyle. As they near the beast, Kyle notes that the storm is swelling and they should head back to the monastery. He then orders his guide to throw a grenade in a snowbank to engulf Benton in an avalanche so that he can take full credit for bringing the first yeti back alive. The Sherpa does as ordered, causing a huge snowfall which buries Dr. Quest's guide and sends him plummeting off the side of a bank. Once the dust clears, his hand emerges from a deep pile of snow, and is grabbed by a yeti's arm. At the temporary base in Nepal, Jonny Quest is hot in Questworld to play an adventure game. He is on level eight, and must grab an emerald atop a Buddha's face to proceed to the next level. Doing sparks attack by a huge Buddha-faced scorpion; Jonny requests a Gatling gun, but Iris equips him with only a shield and sword per level restrictions. He asks for a bigger sword, and cannot hold it; it breaks, and he makes do by trying to chop off limbs on the scorpion. His victory is short lived when the scorpion replicates, and he swings the sword violently, acting out his movements in real time. Hadji Singh and Jessie Bannon enter to find him about to twirl off the edge of the room's balcony, and deactivate Questworld just in time. Race Bannon solemnly enters and tells Jonny that his dad is missing. They take off in a helicopter to survey the avalanche site and launch a ground expedition, but their search is hindered by a coming storm. They descend a slope, each tethered to one another with Jonny leading and Race in the rear. Hadji remarks that they are going too fast when a huge metal cage trap is activated, and slides down with Jonny and Hadji trapped inside. Jessie and Race are helplessly dragged down with them; the first three go over the edge of a huge cliff as Race digs in with his ice pick. He can't haul them up, sparking Jessie to undo her safety latch and climb down to release the cage. Doing so nearly sends her to her death, but she grabs on to Jonny's foot and climbs up. The rest soon follow, and the team retreat to the Khumbu monastery. There, monks regret that the only other visitor they've had is not Dr. Quest, but professor Kyle. He appears, and Jonny angrily accuses him of abandoning Benton, to which the head monk responds with tranquility that he must conserve his strength. Kyle inquires of the Hand of Khumbu, the mummified hand of a yeti allegedly held at the monastery. The High Lama states that it is a sacred artifact, never removed from its sanctum or shown to outsiders. The team then turn in for the night, but Race stays awake to take a look around. He peers in a window to see a monk exchanging something before being knocked out and dragged away from behind. Three hours later, Jessie and the rest begin searching for Race, and witness the theft of the yeti's hand by professor Kyle. Hadji prepares to nullify the sacrilege by appealing to their nobler instincts, but Kyle has bought out the monks. Jonny takes the hand in a flash and the three flee before coming face to face with a horde of monks in a hallway. Behind them are Kyle, who accuses them of stealing the hand. The monks draw bladed weapons, and Jonny throws the hand at them to distract them before leaping out of a window several feet below to a snowy outcropping. Hadji and Jessie follow, and the three take off despite not having any weather gear. The wise High Lama is suspicious of Kyle, whose monks were not at morning prayers and who is eager to condemn Jonny Quest despite his father's seeming status as his friend. Kyle then draws guns after the Lama wants the kids found alive, and locks them in the chant room. Far away outside, the team slip on treacherous ice and fall to find a hand reaching out from the snow; it is Dr. Quest's guide. They take his supplies, and that night, Jonny feels that his father is dead. Jessie reassures him, and the three sneak back to Khumbu, where they find an infant yeti inside of a chamber. Kyle appears behind them and tries to takes them prisoner, but several yeti assault the monastery and hurl the guards and Kyle outside to his death far below into the snow. One frees Race, and the rest destroy the infants's prison and escape. Race is reunited with Jessie, causing sadness and envy within Jonny; the High Lama reassures him, and he perches near a window come night. The next day, Benton appears at the door and reunites with the team; he notes that he was escorted by two yeti's. He produces a book detailing their culture and order, noting that they have several dwellings around the region. He concludes they're descendants of neanderthals, and the High Lama agrees, noting that they only hid after modern man grew away from harmony with nature. Dr. Quest decides to leave the book with the Lama, as exposing their existence would only destroy them. The Lama takes it, revealing himself to be a yeti by showing his hands as the astonished bewildered team look on with amazement."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0683562/?ref_=ttep_ep25,,"When alligators attack a drilling facility in the Everglades, they leave behind a Viking sword.",[],TV-PG,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"On an drilling rig in the Florida Everglades, a guard notices gators approaching. He takes several shots at them with his rifle, but is soon thrown over the edge by a man dressed like an alligator and his compatriots. Two other guards rush out to the deck and find the ship is on fire. Chief Walker climbs up to find two strange men dressed in alligator suits; one swings at him with a sword, embedding it in the ladder. The other cuts a pipe to knock the chief off the ship as he draws a submachine gun. The two then flee, and when the chief comes back, he notices that the ship has viking emblems upon it, including a longboat. Dr. Benton Quest and Race Bannon examine the sword, now in the possession of a man called Avary in charge of the pumping stations. He notices that it depicts a viking funeral pyre, and dates from the tenth century. Avary notes that officials are looking for eco-terrorists dressed like alligators, and the chief tells Race that he needs no help in finding them. Meanwhile, Jonny Quest and Hadji Singh are tearing up the Everglades in a air boat when Bandit flies over the side on a hard turn. He swims ashore only to find an alligator pursuing him; he then paddles back to Jonny, and Hadji tries to seek his forgiveness. After Dr. Quest and Race prepare to depart, Avary tells the chief that having Dr. Quest on the case will make them look like the good guys. The chief asks what will happen if Quest finds their cover-up pumping stations, and Avary tells him to ensure that doesn't happen. Walker, Benton, and Race take off in a motorboat with a air boat tethered to it as Jonny and Hadji catch up. Unfortunately, Jonny hits a sandbar and the two fly into the muck, where an alligator appears. It does not attack, and the two are soon captured by the vikings, who tie them to poles and march them back to camp. Race goes in after them but ends up wrestling an alligator before Walker shoots it; he returns to Benton and orders a search party deployed. Jonny and Hadji are taken by a longboat with an alligator figurehead, and notice that vegetation dies near the viking camp, which is an assortment of stilt and tree houses. Race does not want to stop searching, but only Walker's men have lights and must be trusted to do the job. As they return, they find that the water is shallow in certain places and is littered with dead alligators and fish. Race think that Avary doesn't want them to find it, and decides to go ahead with a huge search party which will conveniently expose the environmental issue at the same time. Walker appears saying he's found Jonny and Hadji; Race correctly does not believe him and speeds away with Benton and Bandit on board. Walker raises his gun and fires. Walker fires, destroying their air boat engine before he tries to kill Bandit, who bails. Walker notes to his lieutenant that he won't kill Dr. Quest until Jonny is found. Back at the viking village, Hadji postulates that the vikings are leftovers from the first viking party to visit America, who presumably made their way south and interbred with the local Native American population. As a swordsmith clangs away outside, he notices airplane wreckages and suspects that they get their iron from such crashes. Jonny spots their air boat, and has Hadji give him a lift to begin the escape. He easily parts the thatched roof; Hadji throws him his unraveled turban and climbs up as well. Jonny scampers up the swordsmith's hut, but Hadji's leg pokes through the roof. Pieces of straw fall on the sword and burn, but the swordsmith thinks nothing of it. They continue to the dock; as they stand near its edge, several alligators snap at them and they decide to climb trees to get to their air boat. Hadji's boost puts Jonny on a limb and makes the dock give way beneath him; he barely recovers in time to see the vikings rushing towards the two. Jonny goes ahead while Hadji jumps to a marsh tree and hangs from a rope above the green creatures. The vikings begin shooting arrows as Jonny leaps to the air boat and whirls around to pick up Hadji. On the way out, a viking sounds his bullhorn and a warrior descend on the boat. He takes two or three swings at the team before Jonny blows a fire extinguisher in his face and he and Hadji escape. At the drilling rig, Avary has w5alker tie up Race and Dr. Quest, who object to his plan to drain a ""minute"" percentage of the Everglades. Jonny is flabbergasted with trying to find the rig, and as Hadji shares wisdom, an arrow hits the air boat, fired from an approaching longboat. That night, the vikings approach the rig, surprisingly with Jonny and Hadji aboard. Avary commands Walker to shoot Dr. Quest and Race and dump the bodies, then hears the vikings approach. His inept guards fail to prevent their boarding, and as Avary radios to the police that Dr. Quest was killed, a warrior enters his quarters and slashes him to death with his sword, Jonny and Hadji meanwhile sneak up on Walker and toss him overboard before fleeing themselves. As they prepare to get away in the longboats, the warrior Badur triumphantly shouts above the burning rig. Walker emerges from a ladder and fires a machine gun at him before Badur slices it and throws him overboard, where he's devoured by alligators. Badur is wounded, and the ship explodes, sending his sword flying into the deep; Jonny retrieves it. It is placed on his funeral mound the next day, and Leif brings Bandit by calling an alligator to deliver him on his jaw."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1109299/?ref_=ttep_ep26,,"Race is in a coma after a rodeo accident, and his friends seek help from Questworld.",[],TV-PG,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Jonny Quest goes hot in Questworld with Jessie Bannon and Hadji Singh watching to ride a bull in practice for an upcoming rodeo. Jeremiah Surd watches the event inside a rail car facility, and logs into Questworld, where he shatters the bull and taunts Jonny. He then reassembles the pieces into his body with the bull's head and charges Jonny, throwing him against a rock wall. Hadji cannot log him out of Questworld, as Surd has hacked the entire operating system. He tries to help by outfitting Jonny in a giant mecha battle robot, and the two duel until Surd gets the upper hand and prepares to stomp the young Quest. Jonny rolls out of the way and performs a punch kick combo on Surd to throw him against a wall and remove his head casing. Julia pull him out just as Jonny tries to deliver the final blow. He orders Julia to double surveillance on the Quests, and cryptically notes that the rodeo has just begun. Later, the team fly to Cheyenne, Wyoming for their Frontier Days rodeo in the PBY Catalina. Jessie starts the amateur bronco riders off, and is thrown off her horse in a few seconds; Jonny meets a similar end in the competition. Next up is Hadji, whose name cannot be pronounced and is assumed to be a pseudonym. Warned that he is not holding on tight enough before his round, he channels his tranquility to the bronco and settles it to a standstill. He then placidly exits the round to Dr. Quest and Race Bannon's astonishment. It is then Race's turn to vie for the national championship by riding the ""Skull Stomper"" bull for seven seconds. He's off to a good start when Lorenzo fires a maddening dart into the bull's side, making it berserk. Race rides for the required time as the crowd and announcer are amazed by the bull's sudden ferocity; he dismounts, but the bull intends to charge him. A rodeo clown distracts him but is sent flying; Race throws a metal barrel at the bull to redirect his attention. The bull charges and Race trips up his feet, leading to a savage horning on his back. The bull closes in to massacre Race as Jonny, Jessie, and Hadji try to distract it; the terror ends when the bull is shot with a tranquilizer. Race is hospitalized and comatose, as a vital neural pathway between his neocortex and hypothalamus has been damaged. He proposes linking Race to Questworld and stimulating his senses to revive the pathway. Surd laughs in his base at the irony of Race's apparent paralysis, and Julia is impressed by Dr. Quest's mapping his entire brain for the reactivation procedure. Surd suspects that such a technique, if successful, might also fix his paralysis and logs on to Questworld. Access is denied by new security measures until Surd has Julia transform his representation into a subatomic form. Once he's in, Dr. Quest declares a code blue and notes that Race's vital signs are fading. Jessie speaks to him through Questworld, and he awakes in a river; on one side is a dark, stormy forest and on the other is a grassy knoll with an amber sky and the remains of a Roman style aqueduct. Through the grassy side runs a rainbow colored beam of light. Surd is floating in an azure pool, and Julia tells him that they're somehow off the main Questworld environment. She makes a few modifications and sends Surd directly into Race's mind as the team wonder how they can follow or contact him, and Hadji decides to use meditation. He appears as Race touches the rainbow stream, telling him that he's hovering between life and death in the space known as Bardo. Negativity is amplified to extremes, and if he crosses the river, he moves on to the next life and will be lost forever. Hadji cannot stay, and as Surd watches, he reminds Race not to cross the river. He comes out of his trance and relays the same information to the team as Surd appears to Race at Bardo. He taunts Race, noting that he's there to move him across the river, and transforms into a bull to spark fear within him. Race regains his courage and takes Surd by the horns, tossing him into the river. Surd is dumbfounded by the effects of the river upon him as Race punches him to its edge, causing him to go into an apparent seizure in the real world. He pushes Surd to the other side, where an orb forms around him and prepares to carry him off. Lorenzo cuts the power to Surd's Questworld unit, freeing him from his coming death. An orb then forms around Race, but he hears Jessie's pleas for his life and breaks free, at which point he's pulled out of Questworld. He reunites with the team, seeking a hot bath, a cold drink, and a confirmation whether he won the championship."

The show opens with an establishing shot of New York City in the year 2418. Ed Mercer arrives by commuter pod to his apartment. He hears his wife, Kelly Grayson, giggle from the bedroom. He opens the door to find Kelly in bed with a Retepsian named Darulio. She pleads to talk with him but he returns to the pod and leaves.

A year later, Admiral Halsey summons Mercer to his office in Planetary Union Central. Halsey acknowledges that Mercer's performance in the past year has markedly declined, tardiness and sloppy workmanship hurt Mercer's record, but ""the Union needs captains"" and offers Mercer command of the USS Orville, a mid-level exploratory cruiser. Mercer hurries to find Gordon Malloy, a former pilot, and enlists him as helmsman of his new ship.

Mercer and Malloy fly to the Union Dockyard orbiting Earth, where the Orville awaits.

ACT 2

In the ship's Shuttle Bay, Mercer introduces himself the crew of the ship. He meets the senior staff: Chief of Security Alara Kitan, Navigator John LaMarr, Second Officer Bortus, Chief Medical Officer Claire Finn, and Science and Engineering Officer Isaac.

Before departure in the afternoon, LaMarr meets Malloy in his quarters. Malloy explains that he was disciplined for damaging a Union craft with a risky flight maneuver. ""I was trying to impress a girl,"" he admits. Halsey tours the ship's interior with Mercer one final time before wishing the captain good luck.

The Orville departs the Dockyard and embarks on its first mission under the new captain.

ACT 3

The bridge crew discuss their mission to resupply the Epsilon Science Station on the colony planet Epsilon 2. While on route, Halsey sends orders to briefly rendezvous with a nearby station to pick up their new First Officer. Mercer reads the new addition's name and stampedes to his office.

Mercer calls Halsey, incensed that the new First Officer is none other than his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson. Halsey dispassionately replies that complaining about the placement on his first day ""will not look good,"" and Mercer is stuck with the decision.

Grayson tepidly enters Mercer's office and apologizes for her affair. She continues that she requested the transfer to Mercer's ship to atone for her behavior, but the conversation quickly devolves into an argument about their relationship prior to the divorce. Grayson concludes by saying that she will transfer to another ship as soon as an opening becomes available.

Grayson meets Malloy in the hall. She hopes that their relationship will be professional considering that Malloy and Mercer are close friends.

ACT 4

The Orville arrives at Epsilon 2. From the Bridge, Mercer speaks with the station's overseer, Doctor Aronov. Aronov looks panicked; the station needs no supplies, but the request was sent for an urgent matter that he will only discuss on Epsilon's surface.

A small away team to the planet is formed: Mercer, Grayson, Finn, and Kitan. Aronov gives them a brief tour of the facility, including giving Mercer a handful of modified redwood seeds that can can grow into a tree in any environment.

Aronov ushers the team into a wing of the facility where temporal fields are studied. A recent breakthrough has led to the creation of quantum accelerator, a device that can accelerate time inside a ""quantum bubble."" Janice Lee, a physicist researcher, demonstrates by aging a month-old banana to 100 years in only seconds. Kitan realizes that the accelerator is more than scientific equipment, it can be used as a weapon to turn ""entire armies into frail armies.""

Suddenly, a nearby lab technician pulls out a PM-32 and demands the accelerator.

ACT 5

The technician is Derek Ashton, an undercover Krill spy. He calls for a Krill destroyer to raid the facility and steal the device. From the Orville, Bortus attempts to communicate with Mercer, but Ashton forces Mercer to say the Krill come in peace.

Kitan manages to subdue Ashton. The team grabs the accelerator and flees to the shuttle, pursued hotly by Krill soldiers. In space, the Orville (now aware of the situation), distracts the superior Krill ship by firing on it.

Safe on the shuttle, Finn dresses Mercer's shoulder injury--he was shot while running to the shuttle. Nearly at the Orville, the team is interrupted by a Krill soldier who managed to board the shuttle and hide.

ACT 6

The soldier holds the shuttle at gunpoint with a Plasma Rifle, demanding the device. Mercer decelerates rapidly and the inertia sends the soldier flying into the front of the ship. The shuttle parks in the Orville's Shuttle Bay, and the away team hurries to the Bridge.

Though the Orville was able to distract the Krill destroyer, the spatial coils are badly damaged and the ship is no longer able to match the destroyer in battle. The Krill captain demands the device lest the Orville be destroyed.

Grayson schemes to place a redwood seed inside the quantum accelerator and send the device to the Krill by remote shuttle. Mercer gives the activation code to the Krill captain, which activates the device and causes the seed to grow rapidly into a massive redwood tree, destroying the enemy ship.

In Mercer's office, Grayson announces that she will transfer to another ship. Mercer admits that Grayson is a brilliant officer, whose talents the Orville cannot afford to lose. Problems stemming from the divorce can be overlooked.

Grayson meets Halsey in his office in New York to thank him for her position. It is revealed that she requested that Mercer was promoted to captain of the Orville."

While walking down the street, they approach a news vendor who asks where their badges are and offers to sell them some. As they continue to walk down the street, Lt. LaMarr starts teasing Lt. Kitan about her latest breakup by grinding on a public statue. Unknown to him, several bystanders record the act and upload it for viewing by the entire population.

The team enters a local coffee shop and start to ask Lyselle, who is behind the counter, if she has seen the anthropologists. She is confused by their questions, everyone knows who these two are because they have been corrected. While in the coffee shop, the video of Lt. Lamarr's grinding is seen on the view-screens, and everyone starts to surround them and take videos. As they hurriedly leave the shop, Lt. LaMarr is arrested for his lewd behavior.

While waiting in an administrative office, it is revealed that the justice system is a pure democracy, using up votes and down votes to decide guilt or innocence. Instead of a trial and a lawyer, he is assigned a PR agent and will be required to go on a publicity tour for a week where he has to convince the public he is truly sorry for his transgressions as they vote. If he receives 10,000,000 down-votes, he will be 'corrected'. Lt. Kelly remains with LaMarr to help on the publicity tour, while the rest of the team searches for the missing anthropologist. The first event does not go well, with Lt. LaMarr receiving more down-votes.

The rest of the team go back to the coffee shop and question Lyselle further. She is able to provide them the location where the anthropologists were sent to but sadly reports that one of them was shot trying to escape. After finding the remaining anthropologists, they examine him and learn that correction procedure is very similar to a lobotomy and cannot be reversed.

The team reveals their extra-terrestrial origin to Lyselle and take her back to the Orville. As they question her, they discover she has no concept of any legal procedure recognized by the Union.

As they watch from the Orville, the final publicity event doesn't go well and the down-votes start to skyrocket. It requires some quick thinking by the team and Isaac to flood the stream with comments and manipulated images, stem the tide of down-votes, and save Lt. LaMarr from correction.

At the end, Lysella shows signs of rethinking their justice system."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6082228/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,"Sofia discovers the incredible mystery behind her amulet. Princess Elena from the Kingdom of Avalor has been magically trapped inside Sofia's amulet, waiting for another Princess to set her free, and Sofia is up to the task!",[],G,Release date,"['Jamie Mitchell', 'Mircea Mantta']","['', '', '']",[],[],[],"In the Kingdom of Avalor, Elena takes Naomi up a mountain to show her her favorite view of the kingdom. Elena laments to Naomi how she was trapped in the Amulet of Avalor for forty-one years and then presents to her a broken wand. She tells her that it was Shuriki's wand and how she would still be trapped in the Amulet if it was not for a brave young princess: Sofia. Elena then proceeds to tell Naomi the whole story:

A coach is heading toward Avalor Palace. It is being chased by a green mist. When the coach reaches the castle, Elena comes out to greet her parents just in time to see a person come out of the mist who kills Elena's parents with a spell. The sorceress then proceeds to strike Elena with the same spell.

The attack is revealed to be a daydream that Sofia is having. Flora flies by and dismisses the students for summer vacation. As the Royal Kids of Enchancia heads back to the coach, Sofia's amulet starts to glow blue alerting her that it is time to go to the Secret Library.

Meanwhile, King Roland and Queen Miranda are trying to decide where to take their kids for their summer vacation. When the Royal Twins meet up with them, they reveal they still have not picked a place out. Meanwhile, Sofia grabs Behind the Walls and heads to the Secret Library.

When she arrives, the Library selects a book called ""The Lost Princess of Avalor"" to the shock of Sofia. When the book goes into the pendulem, it turns into a man known as Alacazar, the Royal Wizard of Avalor. He then proceeds to tell Sofia the story of The Lost Princess of Avalor, which is the tale of Princess Elena. On her fifteenth birthday, she was given the Amulet of Avalor by her mother. But on one fateful day, an evil power-hungry sorceress named Shuriki invaded Avalor. She attacked and murdered King Raul and Queen Lucia and set her sights on the palace. As the story goes, Elena chose to face Shuriki on her own. When Shuriki tried to strike her down, the Amulet saved Elena's life by pulling her inside it. Alacazar found the Amulet and discovered that the only way to free Elena was to find a special Princess to set her free. For years Alacazar searched for this princess until he grew too old to continue. He then used the last of his magic to turn himself into the book he transformed from. Alacazar also explains that over the years the Amulet has tested many princesses before her and up till now the Amulet has chosen Sofia to set Elena free, and the daydreams she has been having were Elena telling her the time has come to set her free. In order to free Elena, Sofia must go to Avalor and summon his chanul. Alakazar also warns Sofia to be careful as Shuriki is as powerful and evil as ever. Sofia goes to her family and convinces them they should spend their vacation in the Kingdom of Avalor. The Royal Family of Enchancia then sets sail for Avalor.

The Royal Family arrive on the Royal Galleon under the command of Admiral Vasquez. When Sofia sees Avalor City, she wonders how she is going to find Alacazar's house in such a huge city. Sofia is horrified to learn that they are going to meet Shuriki since Roland sent a message ahead telling her they were coming since it is the custom to greet the King or Queen when visiting a new Kingdom. Meanwhile, Shuriki is using her magic to get ready for their arrival when Chancellor Esteban comes in and informs her they have arrived. The Royal Family are greeted by cheering crowds but Sofia notices that the crowd is not actually happy. Shuriki arrives to greet them and Sofia is wary instantly. Sofia notices a flute playing to Shuriki's chagrin. As they get into the coach, Sofia spots Shuriki's guards take the flute from the boy playing it, upsetting him. They arrive at Avalor Palace where Shuriki gives them a tour before taking them out to a feast. Suddenly, winged jaguars known as Jaquins arrive and snatch some of the food. Shuriki is about to pull out her wand but Esteban stops her and leads the group back inside. Sofia's Amulet glows and pulls her toward the Jaquins which Sofia takes to mean they can help her. Sofia goes up to the Jaquins and asks for their help. The Jaquins refuse stating they do not help friends of Shuriki's. However, after hearing Sofia's plan to help bring Princess Elena back, the Jaquins instantly become delighted to help and take her to Alacazar's house.

Sofia arrives at Alacazar's house. A woman greets her but proves to be of no help when Sofia tells her why she is here. Suddenly, Alacazar's grandson Mateo walks up and asks Sofia about her magical knowledge and reveals that the woman is his mother. Sofia introduces herself and reveals Alacazar sent her. Mateo realizes that Sofia's Amulet is the Amulet of Avalor and takes her to his workshop. Once there, Mateo reveals that he has been training himself to be a wizard in secret since Shuriki outlawed all magic other than her own when she took over. He also reveals that a chanul is a spirit animal that acts as a guide to all the magical things in the world and that it was Alacazar's chanul who revealed to him of Elena's imprisonment in the Amulet and how to get her out. Mateo summons Alacazar's chanul, Zuzo, who tells Sofia what she has to do to free Elena from the Amulet: She has to get Shuriki's wand. Once she gets it, she has to wrap the amulet around it and put both on the Crown of Aziluna, a Maruvian healer who could undo any spell or curse and located in the mountains is a statue of him. After Zuzo vanishes, Sofia does not know how she is going to get Shuriki's wand until Mateo accidentally gives her an idea: To dance with her. At Avalor Palace, Armando is entertaining the Royal Twins while Shuriki's conversation with Roland and Miranda is having her contemplating invading Enchancia. Sofia comes in and convinces Shuriki to dance the sambarossa with her. After Armando has shown them how, everyone dances the sambarossa. During the dance, Sofia pretends to trip and steps on Shuriki's shoes. While Shuriki is recoiling from the pain, Sofia steals Shuriki's wand from her. After pocketing the wand, Sofia convinces Shuriki to let her and her siblings play hide and seek with Armando while she and her parents resume their discussions. When Armando starts counting, Sofia pulls her brother and sister away with her. Amber realizes that Sofia is up to something and asks her about it. Sofia promises her and James that she will explain everything later and right now needs them to stay hidden for as long as possible. James instantly agrees but Amber demands to know why Sofia will not tell them, only for her to say it is for their own good. Sofia heads back to Mateo and the Jaquins with the wand. Both are impressed with her for pulling it off and then the group then flies off to free Elena.

The group arrives at the Maruvian temple where the Crown of Aziluna is, and go inside to find a magical lake. For the magic to work, Sofia needs to swim across the enchanted waters. So Sofia turns herself into a mermaid and dives into the lake. Once underwater, she finds the Crown of Aziluna and does as Zuzo instructed. This causes an island with a statue on it to rise out of the water. Once it surfaces, Sofia slides down to the base of the statue. Suddenly, Sofia's amulet glows pink and descends. Once it hits the ground, a person appears in a flash of pink light. The Amulet returns itself to Sofia now pink. The person is revealed to be Princess Elena, who is finally free. Elena hugs Sofia and greets the Jaquins and Mateo. She then voices her intention to free Avalor from Shuriki. Upon leaving the temple, Elena tells the group of her plan: She is going to use Shuriki's wand against her. Sofia and Mateo want to help but she refuses and flies back to face Shuriki alone with Sofia and Mateo going after her anyway.

Armando is still playing hide and seek with Amber and James when Elena lands in the palace. Skylar wants to help but Elena tells him she has to do this alone. Elena confronts Shuriki in the throne room and tells Shuriki it is time to pay for her crimes, to Shuriki's horror. When Roland asks ""What crimes?"" Elena brings up how Shuriki invaded Avalor and seized the throne from the Royal Family of Avalor, her family. Shuriki tries to pull out her wand only to find out that Elena has it, which makes her deduce that Sofia took it. Miranda is shocked to learn of her daughter's involvement, which Elena confirms, while Shuriki has the Avalor Royal Guards arrest Roland and Miranda. Elena then tries to blast Shuriki, but only succeeds in blasting aside a tapestry that reveals a painting of Elena's little sister and grandparents. Shuriki reveals that was how Alacazar protected them: By placing them inside an enchanted painting even her magic cannot touch. She also reveals that Esteban is Elena's cousin, and then takes back her wand before ordering her guards to seize Elena. However, Skylar flies in and helps Elena escape. Shuriki orders her guards to throw Sofia's family into the dungeon and to capture Sofia and Elena. Roland orders Shuriki to leave Sofia alone and how she'll regret throwing his family in the dungeon, but Shuriki smugly replies that she doubts it. Elena meets up with Sofia and tells her that Shuriki has her family. Together, they fly back to Mateo's house.

When they arrive back at Mateo's house, Mateo's mother, Rafa, comes out and reveals the spell that can free Elena's family. Citizens of Avalor also come over and, at Sofia's urging, Elena agrees to let them help. Sofia and Elena fly to a secret entrance to the castle and sneak into the dungeon. Once inside, they meet Armando, who agrees to help. While Armando distracts the guard, Sofia sneaks past him using her shrinking ability. Sofia finds her family and lets them out. After locking up the guard, Elena explains everything to Roland and Miranda, who forgive Sofia for hiding her real intentions for visiting Avalor. The group then sets off to execute Elena's plan. Meanwhile, Shuriki demands that Esteban produce the results she desires. Esteban protests that when he helped her invade Avalor she promised no one in his family would get hurt to which Shuriki retorts that she also promised him power which she granted after appointing him Chancellor. Shuriki tells him to be grateful she kept one of her promises, or he will end up like his aunt and uncle, King Raul and Queen Lucia. Suddenly, Luna flies in and attacks Shuriki, who chases after her. Once Shuriki is gone, Mateo sneaks in and, using the spell his mother gave him, frees Elena's family, who happily reunite with Elena. The entire group then flies off to execute the next part of the plan: rallying the citizens of Avalor against Shuriki. The Avalorians and the Enchancians all march on the castle together and overwhelm the guards, who lock the gate.

Sofia and Elena fly in and open the gates while Roland keeps the guards busy, through which the Avalorians march through. Despite being outnumbered, and the royal guards fleeing like cowards, Shuriki still has her magic, and as Shuriki raises her wand to blast Elena, Esteban, who was pretending to serve Shuriki to protect his family from her, grabs Shuriki's wand and tosses it to Elena, who snaps it in two. With her wand broken, Shuriki's powers are destroyed and she ages into an old woman, and a horribly weakened Shuriki falls down a waterfall and swims away. Esteban then proclaims Elena is the rightful heir of Avalor. Sofia offers the amulet back to Elena, only to be told that Elena wants her to have it. Elena then assumes the throne of Avalor, to the joy of all the Avalorians. Back in the Secret Library, Sofia and Alacazar both review the story Sofia finished. She has given Elena's story a great ending which has also given her story a great beginning. After Alacazar vanishes, Sofia's dress undergoes a transformation and she leaves the Secret Library. Back in the present, Elena and Naomi both decide to lock Shuriki's wand away in the treasury forever and then head back to the palace together."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2735518/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,The new A-Troupe team results in one top dancer losing their spot. Emily is fighting to keep her spot as Dance Captain.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Brian K. Roberts'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"The new dancers for A-Troupe are announced. Returning members are Emily Stephanie, Tiffany, Riley, James and Eldon. New members joining from B-Troupe are Chloe, Daniel and West. New dancer Michelle is also a part of A-Troupe. Giselle, who was previously a member of A-Troupe and an E-girl, is kicked out and put in B-Troupe. Emily promises Giselle she will find a way to get her back.

As the B-Troupe dancers leave James' ex-girlfriend Beth, who didn't make it to A-Troupe, tells James she misses him, James believes she still likes him.

Emily passive aggressively tells Michelle she needs to work hard to be in A-Troupe, as she believes Michelle does not deserve to be there.

The E-Girls hang out in the juice bar Squeezed and tell new E-Girl Chloe about all the E-Girl rules. Giselle joins them and Emily pulls her aside to tell Giselle she cannot be a part of the E-Girls anymore, as someone has to be in A-Troupe to be an E-Girl. This bothers Riley, who thinks she's being unfair.

Giselle goes to Studio A to perform a solo, saying she got too comfortable and if she'd pushed herself more she wouldn't have lost her spot on A-Troupe.

Kate and Chris discuss the Dance Captain. Kate believes they should go with Emily again, but Chris thinks they should see what Michelle could bring to the studio, as she was Dance Captain at her last studio.

On their way to dance Giselle asks Riley if Emily knows what she's going to do to help Giselle get back in to A-Troupe. Riley says Emily doesn't have a plan yet.

While Eldon teaches a Baby Ballet class, James struggles with his maths homework. He asks Eldon for help but isn't able to get it.

The E-Girls talk about going shopping as E-Girl rule number 15 is if one E-Girl goes shopping, they all go shopping. Chloe has to pay for dance so can't afford to buy things, but doesn't tell the others. Emily is unhappy that Chloe is already breaking the rules. Michelle sits down with them and Emily is confused as they aren't friends and tells her the seat is for Riley so she has to move. She sits with West who comforts her.

Michelle waits outside Studio B, as Stephanie told her A-Troupe rehearsal is there. Giselle arrives and tells her she should go to Studio A. Michelle apologises to Giselle, for 'taking her spot' but Giselle tells her it's okay, because she's a very good dancer and to be careful with the E-Girls. Giselle goes into B-Troupe rehearsal where the dancers are all messing around, Giselle sees how much she doesn't fit in.

Michelle arrives late for A-Troupe rehearsal, Kate and Chris are disappointed about this. She says she got lost rather than tell them Stephanie lied.

Kate and Chris announce that they're going to pick Dance Captain. Emily thinks they're going to vote and it'll be her, but Kate and Chris say Michelle will have a chance of being Dance Captain too. Michelle reluctantly agrees to audition. Emily isn't happy but is willing to take on Michelle as she really wants Dance Captain."

Roberts'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"To establish Dance Captain the team will be split into two groups, Emily and Michelle will both choreograph a dance, the best dance will decide Dance Captain. Emily wants to work with her E-Girls but Chris decides the teams, splitting them up. He puts Chloe, Daniel, Tiffany and Eldon with Emily and Stephanie, James, Riley and West with Michelle. Emily's team will rehearse in Studio A while Michelle's will rehearse in Studio B.

In Squeezed, West challenges James to a dance battle, by dancing at him. James is freaked out and leaves.

Stephanie reveals to the other dancers that Michelle is Miss National Soloist. The others are very impressed and Michelle tells them she's won Nationals. Emily's team start rehearsing while Michelle's team do a fun warm up exercise. Stephanie refuses to participate.

Chloe tells Emily she has to leave because she has a shift at her job. Emily doesn't let her leave.

Michelle's team decide their dance is good and they should go home, while Emily's exhausted team has to stay and keep practicing. Emily sees Riley as she's leaving and goes to ask about Michelle's dance. Riley reassures her and Emily asks to be kept informed. Riley doesn't like how threatened Emily is, and is worried how it will affect the team.

James mum comes into the studio to talk to Chris about him struggling in school, especially maths. She says she wants to pull him from the studio, and Chris says he'll help James with maths as he's worried how James leaving will affect the team.

In Squeezed, Stephanie tells the rest of the E-Girls she has a plan to prevent Michelle winning Dance Captain. Riley is very concerned what this is.

Chloe and Daniel tell West they are very tired from Emily overworking them. James arrives and West dances at him again. James doesn't join in and leaves.

Kate and Chris ask Emily and Michelle how their dances are coming along, Emily asks for more time but Michelle says she's ready. This annoys Emily and Kate and Chris decide they've had enough time and they should perform.

Emily performs first and her dance goes well. When Michelle performs, Stephanie deliberately dances badly to ruin Michelle's chances. Afterwards Stephanie lies and says she just hadn't rehearsed enough.

Riley tells off Emily and Stephanie, Emily accuses her of not being a real E-Girl as she is breaking the number one rule, an E-Girl always has another E-Girl's back.

Chris still has faith in Michelle as Dance Captain, but they end up choosing Emily. This causes a fight to break out within the group.

Chris leaves and comes back with a bucket of ping pong balls which he throws onto the floor to clean up, to force them to work as a team.

While clearing them up, West dances at James again. This time James joins in, and then everyone else starts dancing too, bringing them back together as a team."

Roberts'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Kate announces the dancers are going to compete in a local dance competition and she would like to change the line placements. The dancers will have to audition for her and Chris to decide the placements. Emily wants to make the decision, as she's Dance Captain, so convinces them she should do it.

Daniel is planning to choreograph a dance for J-Troupe, to freak him out Tiffany tells him they're 'crazy', because E-Girl rule number 46 is never let anyone else in A-Troupe look too good.

The A-Troupe dancers perform for Emily, Riley messes up her dance so believes she'll be in the back row. Emily is very critical of Michelle's audition. The other dancers think Michelle should be in the front row.

Emily and Stephanie go into Kate's office and pretend that they're checking the line placements with them, when really they're telling Kate about a light bulb that went out.

Emily puts Michelle in the back row and then puts Riley in the front row. This makes Riley suspicious as she doesn't think she deserves front row. They perform their routine and Riley struggles as she isn't used to being in the front row. Emily calls a break for everyone so Riley can have a moment and doesn't listen when Riley explains that she shouldn't be in the front row.

Daniel is very nervous choreographing for J-Troupe because of Tiffany. Tiffany told them if they were difficult for him they can perform for A-Troupe, so they pick on him and are deliberately slow to learn the steps.

Riley asks James if he thinks she should be in the front row, and he tells her he thinks Michelle should. Riley is sad because she hoped maybe he believed in her. James tells Riley he got her something 'from the top of a mountain' and gives her mountain spring water.

Tiffany turns up to help him with the J-Troupe who start co-operating, making Daniel like her.

Riley goes to see Kate to ask her why she approved the line-up with Michelle in the back and her in the front. Kate reveals she didn't have anything to do with it. Riley goes to talk to Emily about it and Emily gets angry that Riley isn't accepting Emily did something nice for her.

Back in rehearsal Riley tells James that Kate didn't approve the dance placements and that she has an idea of something to do. James encourages her to do it. As they get in position to dance Riley moves Michelle to the front and stands in the back. Riley tells everyone Kate didn't approve the line placements. She asks the group if they agree that Michelle should be in the front row, James, Daniel and West speak up to say yes. Emily concedes and lets Michelle dance in the front. Kate comes and tells Emily well done for moving Michelle to the front.

J-Troupe perform for A-Troupe and their dance goes well.

Afterwards Riley goes over to the E-Girls and Emily tells her she thinks Riley hasn't been loyal enough to the E-Girls and asks the others if they want her out. They all vote yes and Riley is no longer an E-Girl."

Michelle suggests they should spend the day off at the beach. Emily says that the E-Girls have to help out with dance camp. Riley asks Emily if she wants her to join and Emily rejects her.

At the beach, Michelle compliments Riley's necklace, which she says was a gift from her grandma to Emily and Riley is borrowing it.

At dance camp, Chloe is struggling as she isn't comfortable around little kids.

The group at the beach combine dancing and playing frisbee. After a while Riley realises she's lost Emily's necklace. The group look around the beach and ask other people if they've seen it.

At dance camp Emily realises one of the children, Margie, is missing. She leaves Chloe responsible while she and the other E-Girls search the studio. Chloe is very awkward with them.

At the beach, James spots a man with a metal detector and asks him if they can borrow it to find the necklace. He says they can, if they give him a hundred dollars. Michelle says she has an idea to get the money.

At dance camp, Margie appears again in Studio A, where Chloe and the other kids are. Emily comes back relieved to see Margie is safe and is proud that Chloe coped with looking after the kids.

At the beach, the group dances for an audience who give them money. They have made the hundred dollars they need and go get the metal detector. After a bit of searching they find the necklace.

Back at the studio James compliments Emily's necklace and the group from the beach all laugh. Riley is annoyed because she doesn't want Emily to find out it was lost"

Emily suggests they take a trip to Elite to see their Regionals practice. Riley offers to go but Emily turns her down. Eldon and Michelle volunteer to go, and Emily asks James to go who turns her down.

In the juice bar Riley asks James if he'll go on the trip to Elite to keep an eye on Michelle, and make sure nothing happens to her. He agrees but says she owes him.

Daniel goes to Studio A to rehearse. While he's there Beth asks about James, which amuses him. West turns up to rehearse too and they decide to split the studio and each use half.

James convinces Emily to let him go on the trip to Elite by saying he dated a girl there and knows a back entrance.

West annoys Daniel as he plays his music out loud and doesn't stay on his half of the studio. Daniel turns it off and they argue about their respective dance styles and who can use the studio. West comes up with the idea that they choreograph for each other. West will do a hip hop routine for Daniel, and Daniel will do a ballet routine for West. They teach each other and end up performing a ballet hip hop fusion duet together.

Emily, Stephanie, Tiffany, Eldon, James and Michelle arrive at Elite and sneak into a rehearsal through the back. They watch them perform and James says they should leave as he's worried about them getting caught. Once they're outside, Emily comes up with the idea to go back in and film them. Michelle volunteers because she wants Emily to accept her. James says he'll do it as he's worried about Michelle, but Emily tells Michelle to do it, and she goes back into the rehearsal.

Worried about how long Michelle is taking, Emily texts her. Michelle's phone goes off alerting the Elite dancers, who call her over. Emily tells Stephanie to go in and see whats happening. Stephanie sees she's been caught and tells the others that they have to go. James protests but Emily forces him into the car and they abandon Michelle"

On her 14th Birthday, Star Butterfly eagerly accepts her mother's magic wand. Though cautioned to take care of it, lest it fall into the hands of evil, Star claims she can handle her new responsibilities...but within seconds, the kingdom is plunged into chaos!

Star fears she'll be sent to St Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses, but her parents claim they are sending her to the Earth dimension 'to train.'

Enrolling Star in Echo Creek Academy, a student named Marco Diaz is assigned to guide her around, as many claim him to be 'the safe kid,' something Marco vehemently denies.

At first, Marco thinks Star's strangeness will only be found at school, but upon arriving home, he finds that she will be staying with his family as well.

Showing her to her room, Marco is shocked when her magic wand turns her simple bedroom into a 3-story, turreted structure. When Marco tells how he wishes he had a similar room, Star eagerly goes to his to do the same. However, her magic spell of 'mystic room suck transform,' opens a black hole in the room, sucking in everything!

Marco gets mad at the destruction of his room, and Star attempts to cheer him up, but Marco frustratingly leaves the house.

Catching up to Marco some time later, Star apologizes for her actions, willing to move out. However, the moment is broken when some monsters led by a bird-creature named Ludo, intervene. Ludo and his minions attempt to take Star's wand from her, but are waylaid by its powers, along with Marco's karate skills.

The group is soon over-powered, and return to their dimension. Realizing that he may have overreacted, Marco decides he is okay with Star staying with him and his family.

Party With a Pony -


Marco is all set to spend an evening eating nachos with Star, when they receive a visit from Star's friend from Mewni: Flying Princess Ponyhead! However, Ponyhead is a little perturbed at finding out her best friend Star, considers Marco to be a best friend as well. Ponyhead wishes to go out, and using her dimensional scissors, the group begins to dimension-hop.

The group then head to The Bounce Lounge dimension, where Ponyhead threatens Marco, and almost pushes him over the edge of the cloudy dimension. Star apologizes for her friend's actions, and recommends they all go to The Amethyst Arcade!

At the arcade, Ponyhead catches a glimpse of some hooded figures, and quickly recommends that Star and her go on to another dimension, with Ponyhead claiming that Marco went on ahead.

However, when Star finds her friend lied to her, she demands they go back for Marco.

Back in the arcade, Marco has been captured and is being interrogated by the masked figures. Star is about to intervene, when Ponyhead gives her her dimensional scissors, and catches the attention of the masked figures.

The group is cornered, when a booming voice is head, and Ponyhead's father, King Ponyhead, appears. It turns out the men in masks have come for Ponyhead, as she is being sent to St Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses. However, she wanted one last night of fun with her BFF. Star happily thanks her friend for coming back to save Marco, and even Marco forgives her.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4487558/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,Monster Arm: Star accidentally turns Marco's arm into a monster arm when he has to do karate. The Other Exchange Student: Star is jealous when the family's best friend shows up.,[],TV-Y7,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],"['karate', 'two word title', 'four word title']",[],"Monster Arm -


Marco is looking forward to a karate tournament, where he hopes to show up a rich and privileged student named Jeremy Birnbaum. However, he ends up breaking his hand.

Noting Star's magic wand, Marco requests her to use a magic spell to heal his hand. Using her wand's instruction manual, she attempts to heal Marco, but instead turns his entire right arm into a 'monster arm/tentacle.'

The arm at first seems temperamental, but seems to open doors for Marco, when it stops bully from picking on a nerd, and Marco is hailed as a hero.

Later that evening, Star manages to find a reversal spell, but spends all night trying to perfect it. When she finally does, Marco claims he'd like to keep his new arm, sure that it can help him beat Jeremy. When Star claims that this might not be a good idea, Marco orders her to leave.

After he's done so, a spike-toothed mouth opens on the tentacle, and the sentient appendage fills Marco's head with dreams of defeating Jeremy, and even getting his secret crush Jackie Lynn Thomas to like him.

At the tournament, Star comes, but falls asleep from her last few days trying to find a cure. Marco's tentacle arm makes quick work of Jeremy, but then the arm demands that Marco rip out Jeremy's bowels. When Marco refuses, the arm begins to beat up on Marco. Star manages to wake up, and after some time, manages to return Marco's arm to normal...but not before it claims that it is a part of him now.

In the aftermath, it's also found out that Jeremy cheated, as he had brass(gold) knuckles in his boxing gloves, leaving the tournament with no winner.

After all is said and done, Marco's hand returns to being broken, with the possibility that Star's cure may not have truly excised the evil consciousness of the Monster Arm.

The Other Exchange Student -


The Diaz's have celebrated Star Butterfly's arrival everyday since she has come to live with them, but one day, a former exchange student named Gustav arrives! Gustav has come back from Scandinavia, and brought the Diaz's souvenirs. He also cooks meatballs for them, to which they all seem eager to eat.

The next day, Star grows jealous when it seems the family has forgotten her...when she finds some strange books in Gustav's backpack, one of which tells about learning the Scandinavian language. After seeing how Gustav also likes to make sure the Diaz family is eating plenty of food, Star grows more suspicious.

Feigning sleep, Star begins to follow Gustav, soon believing he intends to eat the family! She attempts to tell Marco, who simply thinks she's lost her mind.

The Diaz family heads to Isolation Point, but Star diverts them, and confronts Marco, scaring him out of his wits with her magic. However, he confesses that he is not actually Scandinavian, but an American boy named Charlie Booth, who comes from a boring town. He assumed the identity of Gustav, and has dreams of one day becoming a famous chef, which explains his food preparation skills.

Eventually, the Diaz family finds Gustav and Star, who does not blow Charle's cover...on condition that he leave and never come back to the Diaz household.

Gustav complies, and life returns to normal for Star, with the family returning to celebrating her being with them.

The final image show Charlie Booth, taking on the identity of a French Exchange Student named Francois, and going to another family, who happily welcome him in."

After art class, Marco notices a purple heart on Star's forehead. However, this causes Star to freak out, claiming this is the first sign she's beginning to go through: Mewberty.

Marco attempts to take Star home, but on her way out of the classroom, the sight of numerous boys causes more purple hearts to break out on her face and arms! Things get even weirder when a sticky purple growth extends from Star's arm, and attaches her to a locker! Star hides inside, while Marco goes to look for her wand's instruction manual.

Though Star let their friend Ferguson borrow it, he then loaned it to a school girl named Janna. Marco manages to get the book from her, but is unable to find anything about Mewberty. Wishing the book had a glossary, his words bring forth a small yellow-robed, blue-skinned creature from within the book, who calls himself, ""Glossaryck of Terms.""

Though Glossaryck claims he is only to take orders from Star, he is willing to grant Marco an exception of help...if Marco will provide him with pudding.

Marco does so, but all Glossaryck seems willing to tell him, is to let Mewberty run its course.

Leaving the manual behind, Marco comes across several boys cocooned in some nearby lockers, and sees Star: now purple-skinned, with six arms, and wings! Marco attempts to reason with her, but she begins to cocoon him too...before hearing the musical keyboard of her crush, Oskar Greeson.

Marco attempts to stop her, but his plan to throw a net over Star doesn't work, as she fights against it. Thinking back to what Glossaryck said about letting the symptoms 'run their course,' Marco lets go of the net...leaving Star to carry Oskar and his car into the clouds above.

As Marco laments losing Star...a rain of black-and-white hearts rain down, before Oskar and his car slam to the ground...followed shortly thereafter by Star.

She appears to be back to normal, except for two small 'mewberty' wings on her back. When Marco inquires if this means she can fly, she attempts to do so...but falls down.

-Pixtopia-

Marco, Alfonzo, and Ferguson are using Star's magic mirror to make dimensional prank calls. When Star decides to get in on the fun, a message from her service provider tells that she has exceeded her minute usage, requesting she come to Pixtopia to pay the bill.

Marco feels bad for what he did, but Star ribs him, claiming how he 'messed up.' Marco tries to forget this, and leads the group into Pixtopia, courtesy of Star's dimensional scissors.

Going to the Pixie Management Office, Marco's case is considered useless, as Pixies only accept gold or jewels. The group is then sent to the Shard Mines to work off the bill. Star attempts to use her want on the guards, but her magic doesn't work in the mines.

Ferguson attempts to stand up to the guard, and is led to the Pixie Empress for his disobedience. However, the Empress claims Ferguson ""looks delicious,"" and gigglingly shows an interest in him!

Meanwhile, the others have commandeered a mine car, and escaped from the mines, straight into the Empress' castle, where Ferguson claims he and the Empress are about to be wed!

Marco manages to break Ferguson out of this thought, and the young man tells the Empress he isn't mature enough to make such a commitment...leading for the Empress to declare the group be killed.

Luckily, Star is able to lead everyone out, and back to her room (where she claims the experience has made her consider switching 'service providers'). Marco laments he may have denied his friend the chance to find love, but Star tells that the Empress was intending to eat Ferguson after they were wed.

It is then they realize that Alfonzo is not among them. The audience then finds out he has wed the Pixie Empress, promising to be a tyrannical king!"
