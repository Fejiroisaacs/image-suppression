Sheriff Mike Thompson and Deputy Liv Baker get out of their truck, and Mike asks if it's the ""doctor by the lake"" everyone is talking about. Liv explains that Dr. Harry Vanderspegle has lived in a cabin by the lake for the last 16 years, and has only stayed there for a week at a time. Last winter, he came in late December and stayed ever since.

They go up to the cabin, and see the boat on the lake. Mike whistles to him, and the ""man"" turns around to reveal that he's an alien.

The alien pulls the boat ashore and when Mike asks if he's Harry, the alien takes on Harry's face, turns to the two officers, and says that's him. He asks why Mike wants him, and Mike says that there was a murder in town and since Harry is a doctor, they need him to look at the body. They don't have a town doctor because the town doctor is the victim. Harry drives into town, following the officers.

Four Months Ago

""Harry""'s ship crashes on Earth, struck by a lightning bolt. In order to survive and complete his mission, the alien went to the cabin. Inside, the real Dr. Harry Vanderspegle is reading a book, and looks up at the door blows open. He goes over and sees an alien footprint in the snow that blew in. Grabbing a poker, Harry looks around for whoever broke in, and the alien drops down behind him. Harry turns to see it and gasps, and the alien advances on him.

Harry hits the alien with the poker, and it shrugs off the blow and throws him out a window. It comes outside and they struggle, and it extends two tentacles from its chest, chokes Harry, and throws him into the lake below. The alien then goes back into the cabin and takes on Harry's form, moaning in pain as it does so.

Harry spends the next time watching TV and learning human mannerisms and language from ""Law and Order"". Harry then searches for the equipment on his crashed ship that he needs to complete his mission.

Now

Harry comes into Patience for the first time since he arrived on Earth, and prepares to face his first real test posing as a human. Inside the clinic, Mayor Ben Hawthorne introduces himself to Harry and thanks him for coming. He takes him to the office where the dead doctor is laying. Harry figures the doctor has been dead for at least six hours, going by the smell. The ""corpse"" comes to life, wonders what's going, and says that she was just sleeping.

Ben points out Dr. Sam Hodges' corpse, over to the side and covered by a sheet. He explains that the woman is Asta Twelvetrees, the nurse, and she found the body that morning. Harry introduces himself and says that Abigail was Sam's wife and she has been out of town. Liv tells him that she gave Abigail her number, so he could tell her that her father died. Asta says that she was the last person to see Sam alive, the previous night when she left. She covered Hodges with a sheet.

Harry examines the body and says that it's ""awesome"". He's fascinated by a mystery, like one on ""Law and Order"". He says that it was fun and tells everyone that he knows who killed Hodges: himself, judging from the blood and the angle of the wound. Harry doesn't know why Hodges killed himself.

Ben goes after Harry and tells him that they still need his help. Harry doesn't see why since Ben doesn't have any more dead bodies to show him. The mayor points out that they need to do an autopsy, and the state coroner has been cut off by the snowed-in roads. Ben knows that the real Harry used to run the pathology lab at Rutgers. Harry claims that he was making a job, and the mayor quickly walks off.

A mother is bringing her son Max down the street. Max sees Harry in his alien form, screams, and jumps in his mother's car.

In the morgue, Harry wonders how a human saw though his molecular reconstruction. Only one in a million human have the genetic mutation to do so, and the population of Patience is only 1,000. Asta comes in to assist Harry with the autopsy, and he wonders why she's there. Asta tells Harry that Hodges was her doctor since she was a kid, and she isn't going anywhere until she knows how he died.

Harry tells her to stand to the side and take notes. Asta doesn't trust Harry, and insists that everything indicates Hodges killed himself. She doesn't believe it, and says that she would have stabbed herself in the carotid artery. Harry wonders how he missed that, and performs the autopsy. He removes the organs and sniffs them, and afterward Asta thanks Harry for helping them and says that he did a job. When she compliments him, he says that she's a smarter than a panda and then says that he likes her brown skin.

Taken aback, Asta invites Harry to have a drink. He decides he has to fit in, so goes to have a drink with her. First he cuts Hodges' brain out of his hands and squishes it in his hands. Examining it, Harry thinks the brain is amazing. Abigail comes in and asks where Hodges is.

Later at the bar, Harry tells Asta what happened and that Abigail ran out. Asta says that Hodges' first wife was like a mother to her. Harry doesn't ask her about her childhood, and Asta explains that she married a biker when she was 16, and they split four months ago. Now she's buying Harry dinner because he has a pick-up truck, and she was hoping he'd help her move the rest of her stuff.

The bartender, D'arcy, comes over and says that she'll buy Harry dinner for less than that. Asta introduces her to Harry, and D'arcy is impressed that Harry is a doctor. She asks Asta if they found whoever killed Sam. When Harry asks about the mining equipment mounted on the walls, D'arcy says that it's concerning the 59, and offers a toast to the 59 and whoever killed Hodges. Harry joins in, having no idea what they're toasting. He gags on the local whiskey, and says that it's awful but he wants more. When he wonders why, D'arcy says that it's because he's bad and she likes bad boys.

They continue drinking, and they start dancing to the music in the bar. A surprised Harry joins in, and Asta and D'arcy cheer him on as the other bar patrons join in. Afterward, Asta asks Harry to meet her at the clinic at 10 the next morning, and rides off on her bike. Harry is happy that he managed to fit in perfectly as a human, then remembers Max seeing him as an alien. He figures that he'll break into Max's home and kill him.

Harry drives to Max's house, recognizing it by the car parked outside that he saw earlier. He takes on his alien form and climbs in through the window of Max's bedroom, and bumps into something. Max wakes up and looks around, but Harry hides and Max goes back to sleep. The alien grabs Max, muzzles him, and says that he's just going to kill him.

Max bites Harry's hand and screams. Harry hides under the bed, and Max's parents come in response to his screams. He says that there's an alien under his bed, and they figure that he's making things up and take him to their bedroom so he can sleep with them. Harry gives Max the finger as his mother takes Max out.

The next morning, the hungover Harry continues searching for his spaceship buried in the snow. He comes to the town mine, with a plaque saying that 59 died to save one.

In Patience, Mike and Liv sit in their car outside the clinic. They hum ""Amazing Grace"" together until Harry pulls up, and then Mike goes over and Liv says that Mike thinks Harry stole Hodges' body. Asta comes out, and Harry says that of course he took Hodges' body... and buried him in the snow behind the alley because he wouldn't fit in the freeze.

Jay arrives and says that she's done with the intake forms. Harry notes that she has a fly on her neck, and she irritably says that it's a birthmark, and he's a douchebag As Harry drives Asta to her house to help her move, she says that letting Jay help out at the clinic keeps her off the streets. Asta warns Harry that the town has an underbelly, and that's why she helps kids like Jay.

They arrive at Asta's house, and Harry stays in the truck. Once Asta goes in, Harry looks up what ""douchebag"" means and is shocked by the images. He then goes inside and notices a picture of a buck on the wall. Asta explains that Indians believe the buck protects people from everything. Once they're done, Asta thanks Harry for helping her move. Her ex-husband Jimmy is waiting, and figures that Harry is Asta's ""new man"". She insists that Harry isn't, and they just work at the clinic together. Jimmy tells Harry to go home while he and Asta catch up.

Harry says that isn't what Asta had in mind. Jimmy reveals the gun in his belt, and Asta tells Harry to go. He leaves, and she goes inside with Jimmy. Harry gets in his truck and drives off, figuring that Asta isn't his problem, and he should stay focused on his mission. Despite that, Harry goes back.

Parking in the house driveway, Harry goes up to the door and listens. Jimmy is complaining that she's making him look stupid. Harry smashes through the wall, pulls Jimmy out, and chokes him. Asta runs out and pulls Harry away, telling him that it's not worth it. Harry releases Jimmy and walks away, and Asta kicks Jimmy in the side, cursing him.

Harry drives into the woods with Asta, and stops the truck. She asks if he's going to tell him how he pulled Jimmy through a wall, and Harry claims ""yoga"". He asks why she wanted to come out there, and Asta removes her show and walks off in the snow to the edge of a cliff with a view of the mountains. Harry joins her, and Asta says that she's always been an outsider and figures Harry is as well because he's different. She knows what that feels like, and sometimes just feeling human is alien to her.

Harry agrees, and wonders why she would marry Jimmy. Asta admits that she doesn't know, and says that she got pregnant when she was 16. Jimmy convinced her to give the child up for adoption, and Jimmy always reminded her that she did the right thing. Asta felt like if she left Jimmy, she gave the baby up for nothing. Four months ago, Asta had enough, drove off, and never came back. She goes back to the truck, leaving Harry to look at the mountains.

Later, the townspeople gather for Hodges funeral. Harry arrives and approaches Ben, and asks why everyone is calling him and thinks he's the new town doctor. Ben says that it's the townspeople's right to have medical care, and he had therapy sessions with Hodges and wants to have the same therapy with Harry.

After Ben leaves, Asta comes over and tells Harry that he's a breath of fresh air. Harry gets an idea, goes to the coffin, and opens it. Asta tries to pull him away, and Harry sniffs the body and tells Asta that he has to check the body now.

Asta pulls him away, and Harry says that Hodges cut at his throat because he needed air. He tried to give himself a tracheotomy, but couldn't do it in time. Asta wonders why Hodges would have his throat close up, and Harry says that he was poisoned and one of the mourners is his killer.

Four Months Ago

The alien's mission was to drop the device on Earth and head back home. At the same time, Asta stormed out of her house, found her car keys in the snow, and saw the spaceship pass overhead. When Jimmy comes out over Asta, she gets in her car and drives off. Crying, she finally stops the car and sees a buck on the road behind her

Now

The next day, Harry learns that when the mine caved in, one man was trapped. Fifty-nine went back in and died trying to save him.

Harry finds part of his mission,, marked ""Full Extinction Event"", and figures that when he finds the rest of it, he can kill all of the humans.

Later, Harry goes to his clinic. Asta puts his new doctor's coat on him and tells him that he has a patient in the waiting room. Harry goes in and discovers that it's Max, who screams when he sees Harry as an alien."

A hiker is out in the wildness, and takes a selfie. He slips and almost falls over a cliff, but stops in mid-air just before he hits the ground. The hiker hovers in mid-air and yells for help.

Harry digs in the snow and finds a plate from his device while looking for it. He goes to work as the Patience clinic as the town's new doctor, and discovers Max is his first patient. He screams and runs out, and his father Max is on the street. Kate chases after Max and tells Ben that his son went out the window. Ben joins the pursuit,

In the clinic, Asta comes in and wonders what happened. Harry tells her that Max went berserk, leaped out the window, and ran away. He claims that he has no idea why, and remembers threatening to cut Max's head off with a bonesaw. Harry suggests that Max has emotional issues, and Asta reminds Harry that they need to get it cleaned up because there are patients coming in. Harry walks off.

Kate and Ben try to get Max out from a park bench, and he tells his parents that the alien from his bedroom is the town's new doctor. Kate points out that Harry didn't look like an alien to her, and Max figures that Harry got into her brain. The boy finally comes out and take Max back to Harry to look at his sore throat. Ben offers to take Max back after his exam, and Max figures that they're both going to die. Max walks off, and Kate jokingly tells her husband that if he keeps over-reacting to Harry, they're going to get rid of him.

In the town hall, Ben brings Max in and finds Mike and Liv moving boxes from the sheriff's office. Mike tells him that he has to make around for murder stuff so he has to make room. Max wants to file a murder complaint against Harry for killing Sam, and says that Harry is an alien. Ben says that Max is delusional, and Mike threatens to law Max up for lying to an officer of the law. He tells Max to watch season 1 of 'Oz' and consider whether he wants to go to prison.

Once Ben and Mike leave, Liv tells Max that Mike sometimes seems mean but he's just a teddy bear. She suggests that Harry is putting up some kind of mind shield that only Max can see through, and offers to use her abilities as a sketch artist to make a picture. Max eagerly gives her a description.

Harry figures that since he was a scientist on his planet, he can easily pretend to be a human doctor. He checks a pregnant woman, Judy, and Asta tells Harry that Judy needs pelvic exam. Harry is less than thrilled, and she irritably tells Harry to get done with the exam so she can put her pants back on. Harry finds an ""earring"", and Judy tells him that it's supposed to be there. He checks the Internet on his phone and accidentally takes a photo, then claims that it's a selfie of his first day. Asta comes back in as Harry takes a selfie, and continues examining patients. He's not very calming.

Laster, Asta takes Harry to the diner where her father Dan works. Dan immediately walks away, and Asta tells Harry that her father likes doctors. She talks to Dan privately, and he says that there's something wrong with Harry. Asta points out that he has a bad feeling about every man who gets within 10' of her, and Dan tells her that he doesn't feel anything at all from Harry.

Harry wonders if Dan can tell that he's different, and figures the day can't get any worse. He finds posters of his real face on telephone poles. That night, Harry collects the posters, goes home, and complains to himself that Max just won't give up. He can't leave and won't turn into someone else, given all the effort he put into making the Harry body work properly.

Calling the Hawthornes, Harry uses a fake kid's voice, pretend to be one of Max's classmates, and tells Max that he saw the alien leaving town so Max doesn't have to worry about him anymore. Max doesn't know any such kid, and Harry claims that he's a postman. He claims he has a kid's voice because of a tricycle answer, and soon figures out Harry is really Harry. Max tells Harry that his parents know he's seen an alien, and if Max dies they'll know something is up. Harry calls Max a ""little shit"", and Max hangs up.

The next day, Harry goes to the clinic and finds a young baby, Safe, sitting in the hall. He -pokes the baby with a crutch, and the baby laughs. Asta comes out with Sage's mother, her cousin Kayla. Kayla leaves with Sage, and Kay comes up and Asta makes her apologize for calling him a douchebag. He apologizes that her birthmark looks like a bug. Kay calls him a douchebag, and Asta has Kay set Harry him up in the nurse's office because she doesn't want anyone in Sam's office.

As they go, Asta tells Kay that she there if Kay wants someone to talk to, she's there for her and she knows it's hard to talk when she's sad. Kay says that she isn't sad and walks away. Harry overhears Asta and asks why she has trouble talking when she's sad. Asta explains that she moved out because she and Dan didn't get along very well, and she moved back because she missed home. She says that she doesn't know where Harry is from and asks him where he's from, and Harry says that he's hungry and leave.

Outside, Harry contemplates how he feels empty but the feeling doesn't go away when he eats. He goes over to the bar and remembers that D'arcy was the woman he danced with previously. She insults a client when he asks for a napkin, and then asks Harry if he wants anything. He says that he wanted to go there but doesn't, and D'arcy offers him some of the local whiskey. Harry talks about how he almost killed someone he drank, and says that he's killed before. He tries to pass it off as a joke, and D'arcy jokingly tells him that he should make murder look like an accident. Harry feels that's a great idea, and accidentally accepts D'arcy's invitation to take her bowling.

The next day at their home, Harry meets with Ben for psychotherapy and imagines ways to kill Max and make it look like an accident. Ben points out that Sam wasn't qualified, and the town is lucky that the real Harry started his life as a clinical therapist. The mayor talks about how he often considers wanting to be a child again, and mentions the pit in his stomach. Harry takes an interest, and Ben isn't very helpful.

Abigail comes in and wants to know if Harry thinks Sam was murdered. When she leaves, Harry returns to the topic of Ben's ""hole in his stomach"". Asta and Abigail argue as Abigail clears out Sam's office, and Harry goes in and tells them to be quiet. Asta discovers that Harry ate Sam's chicken from the refrigerator, and Harry is disgusted that humans let emotions override their actions... and wonders if he can get the discarded chicken while they're fighting.

Asta and Harry find Mike outside his office asks him what he's doing about Sam's murder. Mike says that he confirmed Abigail has an alibi for the night Sam died, and he has all the evidence from Sam's office. She tells Asta to stay in her line, while Harry reads their emotions on their faces.

Four Months Ago

Harry's ship crashes, and he goes to a nearby barn and feeds directly from a cow's teat.

Now

As Harry drives away, he wonders if he's infected with human emotions. He goes to the barn and drinks from the cow, and the wife there finds him and Harry quickly leaves.

That night, Harry goes bowling with D'arcy. He notices that she's dyed her hair, and they go to get some shoes. Judy is the clerk, and D'arcy and Judy throw insults at each other. When they go to an alley, Mike approaches them and says that he ""leagues it up"" with his boys on Tuesday and Thursdays. He shows them how it's done and bowls a strike.

D'arcy takes him up on her challenge and bowls a strike. Harry throws his ball into Mike's groin, much to D'arcy's amusement. Mike is not amused and hobbles off.

Harry and D'arcy go to get something to eat, and they talk about embarrassment while Harry tries to figure out how to eat a chili dog. He asks D'arcy how long it will take the snow on the mountain to meet, and she says that it could be a week. Harry tells her not to go skiing, and D'arcy talks about how she used to be an Olympic-level skier but broke her leg and almost died. Harry figures that's great and abruptly leaves. Judy comes by and exchange insults with D'arcy, and they go bowling. Meanwhile, Harry goes to the Hawthorne house and sabotages the brakes on Max's bike.

The next day, Harry meets with an elderly patient, Gerard, who complains that Sam used to tell him not to eat bad food. Harry casually says that Gerard has ten things that will kill him quicker than food. Asta motions to Harry to keep silent, and Harry tells Gerard that he can eat anything he wants because it won't make any difference. Gerard is happy that Harry is being honest with him. Afterward, Asta tells Harry that Gerard usually doesn't like anyone.

Kay comes in and says that Ben brought Max in, and there's been an accident. Ben comes in and Harry assumes that Max is dead. Max comes in with Ben, who says that Max will probably need stitches because he lost control of his bike in the driveway.

Ben isn't thrilled with the sight of blood and leaves, and Harry takes over. He inadvertently reveals that he knew the bike's brakes failed, and offers to give Max Novocain for ""good boys"". Max whispers that he won't be, and Harry tosses away the Novocain and does the stitching. Max insists that it's fine despite the pain, and Harry does more stitches. The boy dares him to do more, and doesn't break even when Harry digs his fingers into the wound. Max claims that he didn't feel anything, and tells Harry that he can take care of himself before leaving with his father.

That night at Dan's house, Dan makes Asta dinner and tells her that she could cut her hair to honor Sam. Asta says that she could handle it, and Dan should let her live her own life. He hopes that she's just upset when Sam dies. After dinner, Asta lies on her bed and looks at a photo of her and Sam together. She grabs a case and goes downstairs, gives Dan a pair of scissors from the case, and he cuts her hair shorter. Dan gives the hair to Asta and she holds it, then puts the hair in a bag in the case. Dan tells her that she should burn her scrubs to release Sam's spirit.

The next morning, Asta rides her bike to work. She gets to the clinic and looks at Sam's empty office, and sits in a chair and looks at Sam's empty chair. She remembers coming and giving Sam some files, and discussing a hypochondriac woman's crush on him. He invites her to play gin rummy, but Asta begs off.

In the present, Harry sees Asta sitting in Sam's office. Asta tells Harry that Dan isn't her real father, and her mother left when she was 1 and Dan took her in. She never felt like she could fit in, and Sam was the only one she could talk to about it. Asta says that she should have never left the night Sam died, and he was always there for her. Harry points out that Sam was poisoned and Asta couldn't have helped him, and she figures that Sam wouldn't have tied alone. Harry invites Asta to play cards, and she agrees.

Harry goes to put his stuff fin his office, and Asta says that it's his office. She deals the cards, and Harry sits down and realizes that he can feel Asta's emotions even though he shouldn't be able to feel it.

That night, Harry makes his way to the mine and goes inside. He finds a piece of tellurium, take it back to the real Harry's cabin, and considers how humans are bonded together by emotions of love and sadness. He wonders if he's more connected to humans as he melts the tellurium. Harry realizes that his ache went away when he found the tellurium, and figures the ache is loneliness. he forges the a disc from the tellurium, makes an anti-gravity disk from it, and figures that he can eventually fly home to his home planet and relive his loneliness.

The next day, two snowmobilers find the hiker's frozen body floating above the debris from Harry's spaceship."

Harry lies in his bed, not needing to sleep, and waits for 6 am. It's 3:26. He considers how much he has to do, finding the body, finding the device, finding the pieces of his ship that broke off, find Max, exterminate the human race, and get milk and cereal. Unable to sleep, Harry checks the Internet for information on how to become a better doctor. When 6 a.m. comes around, Harry gets up.

Two snow patrol members from Promise are out in the woods and gossiping. They stop and each toss dynamite .

Harry is busy digging in the snow, and finds the third piece of his ship. He hears the dynamite go off, sees snow cascading down the hills, and takes cover beneath a tree as the avalanche goes by. A helicopter flies overhead, and Harry realizes that he's not alone.

Back at the cabin, Harry works out on his map of the area that the avalanche covering his search area has set him back at least a week. Kate arrives at his door and introduces herself, and asks if she can come in. Harry eventually lets her in, and she says that Max told her that Harry is an alien, and broke into his bedroom and tried to kill him.

Harry secretly grabs a knife and moves toward Kate. She turns her back to Harry, and as he raises the knife, Kate wonders why Max is making things up. Harry hides the apple he's testing his anti-gravity device on, and Harry assures her that he's not an alien. Kate shows Harry the pictures of the alien that Max has drawn, and doesn't know what to do. She asks Harry that there's anything they can do, and Harry suggests that the Hawthornes move. Kate points out that she and Ben have jobs and they're not moving.

Dismissing his comment as a joke, Harry suggests that Max is just looking for attention. Kate agrees with Harry, and admits that she works during the day. Harry abruptly tells her that it's her fault and she can go, and pushes Kate out the door as she goes.

In Patience, Max discovers that his pictures of Harry have been torn down. Harry is waiting nearby and greets him, and tells Max that no one believes him. They exchange insults and Max goes to school.

At the clinic, Ellen asks Asta to get some prescription pads. Ellen finds them in Sam's desk, but realizes that one is missing and goes to see Harry. He's watching Jay sleep on a couch, and he tells Asta that he wants sleep so badly and explains that he's trying to learn how to sleep. Asta tells him to stop watching Jay sleep because it's creepy, wakes Jay up, and asks if the teenager has seen Sam's prescription pad that is missing. Jay hasn't seen it, and walks out. Harry has been listening in, and Asta asks why he can't sleep. He says that he can't find the on-off switch in his brain. Liv comes in and says that they need Harry at the town hall because they found a dead body in the lake.

Harry and Asta go to the town hall, where Mike is addressing the townspeople who have heard about the body. When Harry asks D'Arcy if they found his leg, D'Arcy tells him that it was a foot, not Harry's leg. She suggests that Harry be a little more sensitive about discussing bodies, and then asks if they can see the foot. Ben says that it's an ongoing investigation. Harry figures that the foot belongs to the real Harry.

Mike tells everyone that the recently lost Sam, and finding the foot means it's a good thing because they're dealing with a serial killer. It's a good thing because serial killers don't run away and hide, but wait to strike again. He figures the serial killer is in the room looking for his next victim. Mike says that they'll run DNA testing on the foot, and Harry figures that if they confirm the foot's DNA then they'll realize he isn't the real Harry. Ben asks Harry if he has anything to add, and Harry says that he's scared.

At school, a bully knocks Max's bag out of his hand. Max's tinfoil hat falls out, and the bully walks off knocking a bag out of Sahar's hands. Max picks up his things and goes over to Sahar, and helps her pick up her bag. She stares admiringly after him.

At the town hall, Harry looks at the severed foot on ice. Liv figures that a boat propeller hit the body and cut the foot off. She jokingly says that she'd think it was Harry's if he didn't have two feet, and says that the medical examiner will let them know if he gets a hit on the DNA. Liv talks about how she did a DNA test on herself, and discovered that her father's best friend is her father. She doesn't recommend the tests.

Once Liv leaves, Harry grabs the bucket with the iced foot in it and goes to the clinic. He matches the foot against ""his"" foot, trying to see if they're the same. Harry figures that it is his foot. Asta comes in to Harry's office, and he hastily tosses the foot aside. She tells Harry that the Briscoes are there for their appointment and leaves. Mike comes in and accuses Harry of stealing the foot and Liv's favorite bucket. Harry says that he can help because he's a pathologist, and Mike tells him to run the DNA sample. When mike refers to the serial killer as a ""he"", Harry suggests that the killer could be a woman and Mike is being sexist. Mike doesn't care and tells Harry that he'll wait until Harry gets him the sample.

Harry goes to an exam room where the Briscoes are waiting with their baby. He sees a poster about circumcision and gets an idea, and decides to cut the foreskin off the baby and give it to Mike as the supposed skin sample.

The baby has been sick for two days, and Harry checks its chest and then asks if it's circumcised. Asta tells Harry that he doesn't need to check the baby, and Harry talks about the virtues of circumcision. Later, Harry gives the foreskin to Mike and claims it's the foot sample. Mike takes the sample and the bucket, and leaves.

At the school, Mike is eating lunch by himself. Kate, a teacher at the school, sit down with her son and Max says that he can't be seen hanging out with his mother. She insists on sitting with him, even when Max offers to pay her to leave. Kate tells Max that she loves him, much to his disgust, and leaves after kissing him on the head. The other kids see the whole thing and laugh, and one of them throws one of the Max's alien posters at Max. Sahar comes in and sees what happens, and sits down with Max. She tells Max that she believes him.

Harry returns to the cabin, and finds Mike, Liv, ben, and divers on the beach. Mike says that they're searching for the body. Ben says that they don't have a budget to keep searching the lake, and Mike says that they're not going to stop searching the lake until they find the body.

At the clinic, D'Arcy comes in and tries to cheer Asta up after Sam's death. She tells Asta that maybe she needs to get her mind off of it by going out with her They go to the lake beach, start a fire, and have some beers while watching the search party look for the body. D'Arcy figures that they have a ""live show"" with a bloated corpse as a finale, and talks about the man she was dating ghosted her and she's hoping he's on the search party so she can get some closure.

D'Arcy points out that J.T. is having a party later, and Asta talks about how they got out of Promise and chased their dreams. Her friend points out that reality chased them back.

Ben is on Liv's search boat, and as she comes in for the night, Ben starts throwing up. He tells Mike over the radio that he's seasick, and Harry on-shore listens in. Mike tells Ben and Liv to continue the search, and Harry worries.

Now

As night falls, Asta and D'Arcy continue watching and D'Arcy notices Harry's cabin nearby. She says that Harry reminds her of Danny Oliver, the guy who took Asta to prom. The two women start dancing like they did at prom.

Liv tells Mike over the radio that the body may have already washed up. Mike figures Ben is still sick, and tells Liv to stay on mission. Harry, listening on the radio, figures Mike isn't going to give up and works out a cover story about the body being his twin brother, Frederico. The real Harry's body washes up on the shore, and Harry spots it and goes over to it. He drags the body into his cabin and inside, as Asta and D'Arcy come in and call out to Harry, asking if he's home.

Harry tosses the body behind the couch and asks why they're there. Asta asks if they can use his bathroom, and Harry directs them to it and says they have to leave because he's busy. Once the two women go to the bathroom, Harry drags the body to the cellar.

D'Arcy goes through Harry's medicine cabinet, and discovers that he sorts his vitamins alphabetically. Asta and D'Arcy come out as Harry returns, and D'Arcy tells him that they're going to a party and he's not invited that her ex J.T. is having. She tries to flirt with Harry, who has no idea what she's doing. Asta drags D'Arcy out, and outside D'Arcy tells Asta that Harry is jealous but hiding it.

At the party, Asta and D'Arcy meet up with their high school friend Lisa. High schoolers are there, and Lisa realizes that Asta invited her to a high-school party. Lisa isn't thrilled, and D'Arcy ends up dancing with a high schooler without initially seeing his face. When she does see his face, she sees his braces and realizes that it's a high-school party. Asta and Lisa come over and tell her that J.T. has a son named J.T.

A stoner offers them pills, and Asta realizes that they have Sam's name on the bottle. The prescription was written after Sam died, and Asta tells the stoner that she's taking them with her. The stoner backs off, and as the women leave Asta sees Jay passed out in a chair. Asta wakes Jay up and wakes her up. They drive Jay home, and Asta gives Jay cedar to burn to meditate, that Dan gave her.

Jay goes inside, and Asta remembers the past and Sam taking her and a baby to the same house. Sam takes the baby to the waiting couple, while a young Asta watches and breaks into tears. D'Arcy asks Asta if she's okay, and Asta only says that they should get out of there.

Mike and Liv come ashore and go to Harry's cabin. He answers the door when they knock, and Mike tells him that they will come back in the morning to continue the search. Mike's police dog Cletus runs into the house, barking, and runs to the cellar with the body in it when he picks up the scent. The others chase after Cletus, and finds him pawing at a freezer. Mike opens the top and finds packages of bison meat inside. The officers leave, unaware that the real Harry's body is beneath the packages of meat.

The next morning, Asta finds Dan in the kitchen. He's making breakfast for his daughter, and watches her as she eats. Asta finally tells him that her baby was a girl and breaks into tears, and she thought the baby would be better off without her. Dan tells her that the bond between a mother and daughter can never be broken. The connection between Asta and her daughter will eventually bring them back together, and Asta nods in agreement.

At the town diner, Asta goes to get some coffee and runs into Harry. He shows her that he's been buying padlocks and she admits that she's done the same, and Asta jokingly wonders who he is. Asta leaves and Harry sits down to eat. Max and Sahar come in, and Max points Harry out to Sahar. She says that she needs to get a closer look at him, goes over, and spills Harry's water in his lap. The two kids run out, and Harry looks out the window and sees them both.

At the clinic, Asta puts a lock on the desk drawer where the prescription pads are kept.

At the cabin, Harry locks the freezer lid shut and then puts another padlock on the cellar door. He then goes to his bedroom, puts on Roy's cowboy hat, and goes to sleep.

Going outside, Harry finds Mike, Liv, and the rest of the police still searching the nearby lake. Liv tells Harry that they switched their search to the shore based on the currents, and Mike can feel it in his balls. Henry inadvertently makes a joke about Mike's balls.

Later in town, Harry goes to the diner to eat and think about humans need companionship to eat. Ben joins Harry and tells him that they're getting closer to finding a town doctor. He invites Harry over to dinner with him and his wife Kate, hoping that it will their son Max a chance to see Harry in a more comfortable setting like their home. Ben takes Harry's silence as an answer and leaves.

Nearby, Asta is at a table, and D'Arcy sees her with a bottle of pills and sits down. Asta says that the she got the bottle at the party and they're dated after Sam died. She figures someone at the party is connected to Sam's stolen prescription pad. D'Arcy figures that it was obviously Jay, but Asta doesn't believe it. They argue about who was stupider when they did stupid things when they were 17, and Harry comes over asks Asta to come with him to the dinner date, so that he can sit alone while Asta talks to them.

Asta says that it's weird and she's busy, and D'Arcy kicks Asta until she suggests D'Arcy might go with Harry. She tells him that she'd be glad to go, and Harry accepts.

Later, Asta finds Jay sleeping in the break room. She wakes the teenager up and talks about the dumb things she did when she was a teenager. Asta finally tells Jay about the missing pad, and Harry comes in and asks what's going on. Jay tells him that Asta thinks she stole the pad, and even Harry figures it's obvious that Jay stole it. When Jay out, Harry pockets the food Asta bought Jay and leaves.

Later, Max returns home. Kate and Ben tell him that Harry is coming over to dinner. Before they say anything, he figures they're getting a divorce. His parents assure him they're not, and that Harry is coming to dinner. Max panics, wishes they were just getting a divorce, and goes up to his room.

In his room, Max packs to run away and calls Sahar on a walkie-talkie. She answers and Max says that he'll be dead soon. Sahar figures they can use the visit and her plan to break into Harry's cabin.

That night, Harry and D'Arcy arrive. Max is waiting and greets Harry cordially enough. As he hugs Harry, he secretly steals Harry's truck key.

Kate is surprised and apparently thrilled to see D'Arcy there. D'Arcy hugs Harry and says that he's very into he.

Sahar is outside, and Max calls her on the radio and tells her that he has the keys. Sahar checks Harry' truck and accidentally honks the horn, then finds the cabin's door keys. She rides off, and Max goes to the dining room. Harry wonders what Max is up to, and Ben asks about Harry's background. He claims that he's from New York City, and recites the opening dialogue from the show he's watched, 'Law & Order' and ""Sex and the City'.

D'Arcy tells Max that she's know Ben since they were younger than Max when they met. The two of them laugh over elementary school memories, and D'Arcy says that Ben was her first kiss. Kate has never heard the story, and D'Arcy jokingly points outs that they never broke up. Ben jokingly says that he's been cheating on D'Arcy with Kate, and Kate goes to the kitchen to get more salad. Meanwhile, Harry glares at Max and Max smiles innocently.

Sahar goes to a nearby store where Mike and Liv are buying ""evidence bags"". Mike is buying Hot Wheels cars, and Mike insists that he's keeping some kid from buying it, chasing it out into traffic, and getting killed. Sahar tells Liv that she's buying tampons, and looks at the long line to the key-making machine at the counter.

Ben joins Kate in the kitchen and tells her that dinner is a success. Kate thinks it's weird Ben never told him that he never made out with D'Arcy. Ben says that it was no big deal. D'Arcy comes in to get some wine, and Ben hugs Kate. After D'Arcy mentions talks about how they used to sit on the coach when they were in 10th grade, she grabs the wine and leaves.

Since they're alone, Harry asks Max why the boy is being so nice to him. Max says that Harry didn't mean it, and Harry insists that he did.

Sahar finally gets to the counter.

Max goes to the door but doesn't see Sahar outside. Ben calls him back for dessert, and D'Arcy discovers the wine is gone. Max says that Harry and D'Arcy can't leave, and he wants to show them his solar system. He shows it to everyone, and Harry laughs hysterically when he says that he made a joke earlier about Mike's balls. Max stalls for time until Sahar gets back, offering to read his book report.

Sahar finally gets the key copied and rides back to the house.

D'Arcy dozes off from boredom while Max reads his book report, and Kate thanks Harry for coming. She's not so enthused about D'Arcy coming back. As they go out, Max grabs Harry's leg and begs him not to go. Kate pries her son away, and D'Arcy hugs her ""sisterwed"" goodbye. Kate and Ben go back in the house, and Max peers out the window looking for Sahar. In the truck, Harry considers if Max really likes him. He finds his house keys where he hid them, and drives off.

Sahar comes out of hiding and holds up the duplicate keys so Max can see them.

Harry drives D'Arcy home and she asks if he's going to kiss her. The alien figures he can do it. He ends up licking her face, and D'Arcy says it's not the worst kiss she's had. As she goes, Harry wonders why his penis is having rigor mortis.

The next day, Dan comes into the clinic and tells Asta that her grandmother called. Dan asks if they can take her a steroid shot for her back, and wants Asta to go instead of Harry. Harry doesn't want to go, and Asta doesn't want either of them to go. She leaves, and Dan glares at Harry.

At the sheriff's office, Mike and Liv go over everything they've dredged from the lake. Liv points out the doorknob that the alien Harry ripped from the real Harry's door, but Mike doesn't think it's important and thinks it came from a sunken houseboat.

Dan drives Harry and Asta to the reservation, and Harry is surprised to learn that humans can be with each other and not talk. He's happy, and says that he has to pee. Dan stops at a gas station. David and Lisa are in a RV there, and Dave points out that Lisa killed the cowboy they were questioning. Lisa points out that the authorities ruled it a simple robbery, and reminds David that their orders are to deliver an alien to the General without anyone knowing about it.

David isn't convinced, and Lisa admits that things are going to get messy. She says that she's eliminating anything that gets in the way of their mission, and that could include David if he doesn't stop whining. David storms out and goes to the restroom, where Harry is reliving himself. Harry asks David if he shivers when he pees, and David admits that sometimes he does. Once Harry leaves, David wonders what the conversation was about.

Dan continue driving to the Ute Reservation, and Kayla greets Asta and Dan, and Harry when he comes over. Kayla introduces her husband Shane, and the guests greet Harry as well. Harry realizes that it's company that brings humans together, not food, and thinks the human feeling to belong feels good to him.

Harry, Dan, and Asta go to Asta's grandmother Ruth's bedroom. Asta introduces Harry and he prepares the steroid shot.

Max and Sahar are riding their bikes down the highway, and Mike comes up behind them in his jeep, turns on his lights, and tells them to pull over. The kids do so, and Mike tells them that they turned without their hand signals. Sahar claims that they saw Bigfoot, and Mike is happy that they're outside instead of staring at a TV. He tells them to go and be safe, gets in his jeep, and drives off.

Liv goes to the bar and D'Arcy serves her a drink. The deputy questions if she deserves to exist, and talks about how everyone was in the bar cheering D'Arcy on when she was in the Olympics. Liv assures D'Arcy that she put Patience on the map, and she just needs one person cheering for her when Mike makes her feel dumb. D'Arcy tells Liv that she's the best cop she's ever seen, and should stand up to Mike.

Harry gives Ruth the steroid injection, and she tells Harry that she can tell he's there to do good things. When Ruth sees Asta with her nephew, she says that Asta should have a child of her own. Harry mentions that Jay is Asta's daughter, much to Dan's surprise. Asta breaks into tears and runs out.

Kayla follows Asta as she goes to her old childhood lean-to, and tells her sister that Asta gave up her kid, never told Dan, and Jay has spent her time wondering who she is. Asta's sister tells her that her secret is going to hurt a lot of people when it comes out, and Asta tells Kayla that she was too young to take care of Jay when she had her. Kayla says that she admired Asta making a difficult decision, holds her, and says that Asta did what a mother does by putting Jay's needs ahead of her own.

The local kids are playing basketball, and Harry joins them. The ball lands near him, and he tosses it back to them, putting it through the hoop. They applaud and Harry plays with them. He's not very good.

Max and Sahar get to Harry's cabin and use the duplicate key to get in. After giving Sahar a tin-foil hat to wear, he puts on one of his own, and they search the place.

Asta finds Dan, and he asks her how she couldn't tell him that Jay was his granddaughter. She says that Dan wanted him out as soon as he learned she was pregnant. Dan tells her that no one ever told her to go, and he hated the way Jimmy treated Asta. Asta says that it wasn't any of Dan's business, and he insists that it was. He says that her family would have been there, especially for him, and Asta tells him that he raised one child that wasn't his own and didn't want him to have to raise another. When his daughter asks, Dan assures her that they'll always be okay, and they hug.

At the cabin, Max and Sahar go down to the basement and find the ship wreckage that Harry has recovered. Sahar tries to open the locked freezer, and Max finds the apple hovering over the tellurium. He calls Sahar over, and when she touches the apple the backlash knocks both kids unconscious.

The basketball game goes into the night, and Harry manages to make a shot... for the other team. Tired, Harry bows out and wonders if he's going to die from overheating. He collapses in a nearby field and looks up at the sky, and sees his home planet's sun 46 light years away. Harry feels closer to it, and Asta comes over and Harry says that the basketball players are incredible specimens.

Asta lies down next to Harry and tells him what Dan says about the Big Dipper. Harry apologizes for telling her secret about Jay, and Asta tells him that he did them a favor. He says that he misses home and has a wife there, but she died do he took a job that brought him to Patience. Harry tells Asta that he wants to go home, and says that it's sad... now.

Later, Dan drives back to Patient with Harry and Asta. Harry figures that humans feel better when they know they're not alone. Asta turns on the radio, and she and Dan sing along together to it. Harry wonders what's going on and finally joins in.

At the sheriff's station, Liv tries to show Mike the doorknob again but he ignores her and leaves. She puts an evidence tag on it.

Harry returns to the cabin and finds Max's and Sahar's bikes parked inside to keep them out of sight from the outside. He closes the back door and locks it, and calls to the children. Harry goes downstairs and finds Max and Sahar unconscious on the floor, and the apple still floating above the Tellurium. He regretfully confirms that they're still alive, puts them into duffle bags, and carries them out, and finds a woman he hasn't seen standing in the kitchen.

When Harry asks how she got in, the woman says that she has the key and she's still the real Harry's wife. Harry drops the bags and stares at the woman in shock."

Isabelle and Harry have a whirlwind romance

Present Day

The alien Harry drives his truck and is offended that Max pretended to be his friend so he could steal his keys and break into his cabin.

Max wakes up in a dark closet. Kate finds him and complains that Ben didn't look for their missing son there. She figures Max went to sleep in there, because he camps out there sometimes. Max remembers what happened at the cabin and plays along.

Mike and Liv arrive in response to the parents' call, and Max's parents tell them that Max turned up in the closet. When Mike says that he caught Max riding his bike out on the hallway, Ben and Kate tells Max he's not allowed to ride that far from home. Max says that he had a good reason, and had to break into Harry's cabin while he was at work. The boy says that he has proof that Harry is an alien, that Harry has alien technology in his basement. Max says that Sahar everything.

When Sahar and her mother get called over, Sahar says that she didn't see anything. She claims that she doesn't remember going to the cabin, and apologizes to Max for not remembering.

Harry returns home and finds Isabelle still there, wearing nothing but his flannel shirt. He tells her that she can't wear that because it's a man's shirt. Isabelle tells Harry that she flew across the country to talk to him, and he left and drove away. She asks where Harry went, and he claims that he went to get milk. Isabelle points out that he doesn't have any milk, and Harry says that he drank it.

Isabelle looks Harry over and asks what's different about him. He says that it's his mustache that he grew and then shaved off, and Isabelle wonders if he's high. Harry says that he is, and Isabelle tells him that she's very cross with him. The alien points out that she sounds like James Bond, and Isabelle says that she was ready to sign the divorce papers and then he stalled the lawyers. Isabelle tells him to sign the papers and hands them to him, and Harry immediately agrees to do so. She says that she thought they could talk about it like humans, and storms off into Harrys' bedroom rather than get a motel room.

Later, Isabelle gets into the sleeping Harry's bed and holds him. He wakes up and wonders what happens, and plays dead. Harry figures that it's nice, and figures that he can sleep after all. Then, Isabelle starts snoring. A lot.

The next morning, Harry wakes up and finds Isabelle performing yoga in front of him. She says that she turned off the alarm, and Harry says that he has to go to his job. Harry explains that he's now the town doctor, and asks Isabelle to take out the trash before she goes home. Going out to his truck, Harry realizes that he's late to searching the mountain and dismisses Isabelle as a distraction.

At the diner, Mike eats with his father, Lewis. Mike gives the ailing Lewis his pills. When Lewis points out that they're not living in DC because of Mike, Mike says that the mountain air is good for his father. Lewis doesn't believe it, and says that Mike is blaming him on everything. He asks if Mike has solved Sam's murder. Mike doesn't say anything, and Lewis tells his son that Sam chose the wrong town to die in. When the sheriff starts to snap at Lewis, he knocks over his water glass and Lewis asks what's wrong with him. Mike apologizes and asks Lewis to take his pills.

Harry arrives in Patience and pounds his feet on the window as he gets dressed. D'Arcy notices and comes over, and Harry tells her that he's putting on his pants. He insists that he's not living in his truck, and D'Arcy tells him that they had fun on their date and kissed, but she doesn't want to date him. Harry is more interested in her coffee, and D'Arcy tells Harry that he's not her type. She thinks it's his ego, but can't describe it. Harry figures that she's not very smart, and D'Arcy takes offense.

Harry figures that human men don't say mean things to women, and he has to apologize. He does so, awkwardly, and assures D'Arcy that she's smart... relative to their species. Harry walks off, unaware that D'Arcy is still angry.

At the cabin, Isabelle notices the lock on the basement door. Curious, she chisels it open and goes downstairs. She finds Sahar's wrap on the floor and smells perfume on it, and figures that Harry is cheating on her.

Abigail brings a box with Sam's medical files into the clinic. She's surprised to see Harry there, and he tells her that Ben hasn't found a replacement for Sam yet ""because he's bad at his job"". Abigail figures Harry wanted Sam's files, and asks if he's finished Sam's autopsy report. Harry tells her that he can't until he gets the toxicology report back from Denver, and says that his insurance claim is null and void if he committed suicide. Abigail suggests that Harry do ""the right thing"", and invites Harry to her salon to cut his hair.

Jay comes out and Harry tells her that Abigail is ""pro-murder"". He has Jay take the files to where the other files go. Asta is in the break room, and Jay brings the box in and says that she doesn't know where to put it. Jay passes on her mother's thanks for Asta helping Jay out the other night, and wants to make Asta dinner. Asta says that they'll talk about it, and takes the box to Harry.

Asta tells Harry that she shouldn't have brought Jay there, since she doesn't know the truth that Asta is her mother. Harry says that Asta should tell Jay that she's her mother, and Asta figures that she can't drag Jay into her life after giving her up. The alien is intrigued that Asta is willing to send Jay away because she loves her, not because she hated her. Harry immediately advises Asta to fire Jay, and offers to do it himself when Asta says that she can't.

Isabelle comes in and asks who the scarf belongs to. She wonders if it is Asta, and Asta takes offense. Isabelle says that she's Harry's wife, and Asta points out that Harry told her his wife is dead. His wife throws the scarf at Harry in disgust, then throws the files and box at him. Isabelle says that she's going back to NYC and leaves.

Isabelle goes to the 59 and orders a drink from D'Arcy. D'Arcy sympathizes when Isabelle says that she's going through a divorce, saying that that she hasn't been divorced and is still working on the pre-divorce. Isabelle wonders how people can change so much, saying her husband used to be alive and present, but is now so blunt. D'Arcy says that the man she's dating is also blunt, unaware that they're both talking about Harry.

Harry finds the Hawthornes waiting in his office. Kate has Max tell Harry that he stole his keys and duplicated them so he could sneak into Harry's cabin. Harry feigns surprise and says that he doesn't accept Max's apology. Kate points out that Max hasn't apologized yet, and Harry admits that he's getting ahead of himself. Max apologizes, and Harry refuses to accept it. Ben says that he has to accept it because of the rules, but Harry figures that Max isn't really sorry so he's not accepting Max's apology.

Kate agrees and tells her son to say it like he means it. Max yells that he doesn't mean it, and Harry says that he's snowflaking. He shows Max several photos, including one of the real Harry, and asks Max to point out which one is him. Max says that he can't tell because he only sees the alien Harry as an alien. Kate tells him to stop fooling around, and Max points at a photo at random.

Harry tells them that Max got it wrong, and Kate shows him the photo of the human Harry. Harry tells Max that he forgives him for breaking into his house because he's sick. Max accuses Harry of setting him up and storms out, and Ben goes after him. Harry tells Kate that it's worse than he thought, and Max sees monsters and scary things. He warns that Max might suffer from ""face blindness"" and anxiety, and shows Kate a special school on the web... in Georgia.

In his office, Mike looks at photos of Sam and tells Liv that he's gone over all the evidence but hasn't come up with anything. Liv is busy playing with a yo-yo, because it calms her. Mike takes it so he can calm himself, and points out that they have nothing on Sam's apparent murder. He breaks the yo-yo and blames Liv, and she says that Sam was probably murdered and the foot in the lake has something to do with it.

Mike says it felt good when he thought they had a serial killer, and is angry that other towns in Colorado have serial killers. Liv suggests that her aunt might punch someone at Bingo night to cheer Mike up.

D'Arcy and Isabelle drink and talk about how they're strong, independent women who don't need men. Isabelle tells D'Arcy that any real man would be in love with her, and real women don't run away. D'Arcy agrees, and Judy comes over and asks where Danny the jukebox repairman is. Judy and D'Arcy exchange insults, and D'Arcy offers a toast to Isabelle for ""women supporting women"".

At the clinic, Jay goes through Sam's files. Asta suggests that the clinic isn't very busy. Jay has found the file saying that Asta had a baby, and the baby was born on Jay's birthday. Asta says that it's complicated, and Jay tells her that Asta gave her away and then lied to her. She wonders if Jimmy is her father, and realizes that he is from Asta's silence. Jay storms out past Harry, who tells Asta that he was going to fire Jay and leaves.

Later, Harry finds Asta sitting on a street bench. He sits down with her and talks about Buddhist monks. Harry says that Asta just lied to Jay and pretended to be a friend, and Asta points out that he lied about his wife being dead. The alien says that humans lie because that's what they do, because they don't want people to know who they really are.

Jimmy comes up despite Asta saying that he'd meet her at the diner. When Jimmy recognizes Harry as the man who attacked him at Asta's cabin, he gets in Harry's face until Asta takes him to the diner. They sit down and Asta tells Jimmy that Jay finds out they're her parents. Jimmy didn't know Jay was their daughter, and says it's messed up.

Harry is at a nearby table, listening, and Jimmy sees him. Jimmy wonders why Harry is there, and Harry says that he's a ""ninja"". Asta tells them to ignore each other, and Jimmy angrily says that Asta also wasn't ready to be a parent. Dan comes out when Jimmy yells at Asta, and Asta tells Jimmy that if Jay comes to find her, he shouldn't ""flip out"" on her. Jimmy accuses Asta of getting involved with Jay if she wanted to protect their daughter, and leaves.

Once Jimmy leaves, Dan sits down with Asta and tells his daughter that it's better that Jay knows. Asta tells her father that it isn't his problem, and Dan says that night when he realized his wife wasn't coming back, he promised that he wouldn't leave Asta to face things alone. Dan promises that Jay has a family that loves her as if she was their own, and Asta takes her father's hand. Harry has moved behind them and clears his throat, pointing out that he's a ""ninja"".

That night, Harry drives back to his cabin and sees the lights on. Isabelle's car is parked outside, and Harry goes in and discovers that Isabelle has made dinner. Harry points out that she said she was going away forever, and Isabelle tells him that she didn't handle things well and wants to make things up to him. She's making steaks, and says that she got them from the freezer downstairs.

Harry says that it's impossible and discovers Isabelle chiseled the door open. Isabelle offers to get some peas from the freezer, and Harry says that he'll do it. He goes downstairs and discovers Isabelle broke into the freezer. The real Harry's body is still there, and Isabelle apparently didn't see it. Harry gets the peas and covers the corpse over, then goes back upstairs.

Isabelle and Harry have dinner, and Isabelle says that Harry hasn't been himself since she got there. Harry insists that he's always been a man, and Isabell figures that Harry is afraid. She says that she's afraid as well, and men showed up at the apartment and said they needed to talk to Harry. Isabelle says that she'll be there for Harry no matter what, and she hugs him while he eats his steak.

D'Arcy drives to Harry's cabin to make another attempt at a romantic relationship with him.

Isabelle tells Harry that they should have a dance, and Harry dances with her. Awkwardly. D'Arcy comes up to the cabin and sees the couple dancing, and drives away. Meanwhile, Isabelle asks Harry what's next. He says that he can only think of one thing, and tells Isabelle to scrub the pans before she leaves. As he walks away, Isabelle sings ""their song"", and Harry goes to her and they kiss.

At the Hawthorne house, Max overhears his parents talking about sending him to Georgia. Kate figures that Max will get worst if they don't do something about it, and points out that Max doesn't seem like a normal boy. Max goes to his room and calls Sahar on the radio, and says that his parents are sending him away. Sahar assures Max that she still believes him about Harry, and she has an idea to keep Max's parents from sending him away. As they talk, Sahar looks at the copy of 'Communion' that she's reading.

On the bed, Isabelle tells Harry that she'll take care of him. She rips off their clothing and kisses him, and Harry tries to remove her bra. Harry finally says that he doesn't know what they're doing, and Isabelle tells him that they're ""reconnecting"", as Harry gurgles.

The next morning, Isabelle lies next to Harry and sees her painting hanging on the bedroom wall. She figures that Harry still loves her, because he didn't have the heart to take the painting down. Isabelle tells Harry that they're going to be together forever and hugs him.

Later, Harry goes to the diner to have coffee. Max and Sahar sit down across from him, and Sahar says that touching the floating apple might have wiped her memory but it didn't kill her. She tells Harry that Max isn't going to Georgia, and she'll teach him how to hold his breath until he gets his way. Sahar says that she snuck Max's ashes into Harry's pocket so he can't spit on them when Max dies. Max says that they win again, and Harry spits on him.

Sahar tells Harry that she and Max are holding their breath until Harry promises to leave Max alone. If he doesn't and they pass out, then everyone will think Harry was responsible. The kids hold their breath, and Harry finally cracks. Max tells him that if Harry stops trying to have him sent away, he'll stop accusing Harry of being an alien. Harry also can't kill Max, and Max and Harry shake on their truce.

Max asks why he can see Harry's true form, and Harry explains. They exchange questions about each other's races.

Asta and Jay pass in the street, and Jay glares angrily at her birth mother.

D'Arcy goes to the 59 and sleeps on a bench rather than go home. She wakes up, and drinks a whiskey with an egg.

Jay goes to the diner, and Dan asks if she's hungry. She says that she's not, but when Dan tells her that family doesn't pay, Jay orders a big meal. Liv comes in and finds Mike with Lewis, and shows him Sam's toxicology report that came in. they show that Sam was poisoned, and Mike is thrilled that they have a murder.

Harry figures that he didn't hate Max, but how he made Harry feel inside: exposed and vulnerable. After talking to Max and Sahar, he felt his hatred for himself going away. He figures that there's something out there stronger than hate.

That night, Harry sleeps with Isabelle and discovers that she snores. He feels close to her, but sometimes wants to be far away. Harry confirms that Isabelle only snores when he doesn't hold her nose, and admits that he doesn't hate her but just needs sleep. He decides to let Isabelle live another day and goes to bed."

Mike and Liv come in, and Harry and Liv discuss coffee. The officers say that the toxicology report confirms that Sam was poisoned with Botulinum toxin, and Harry says that it's a poison people die when they ingest it. Mike tells him that he needs a little more time to dig in.

Ben comes in to get them and introduce them to the doctor that will be the new permanent one at the clinic, replacing Harry. The nurse, Ellen, says that the new doctor is gorgeous, and that it will be something nice to look at for once. Harry takes offense, given he figures his body is attractive.

Ben introduces everyone to Dr. Ethan Stone. Harry jumps in and says that he's there, and thinks that Ethan's hair stupid. Mike asks Ethan about botulism. Ethan concludes that the botulism close Sam's windpipe and then he tried to perform a tracheotomy on himself. When he smells burnt coffee, Ethan offers to fix it and Harry claims that he fixed it. Ben figures they have a real doctor and they can get some work done on the murder, they should have it solved.

Harry says that he has more info and mentions the stolen prescription pads. Asta tells everyone that she already reported it to the state board. Harry feels better about Ethan, until Ethan says that he doesn't ""get"" 'Law & Order'. Furious, Harry storms out and goes to clean out his desk.

Ben comes to see Harry, and thanks him for coming through by being the town doctor. The mayor gives Harry a cinnamon-scented candle he made himself as a gift. Harry tells Ben that Max doesn't have to go to an institution because he's not sick. Ben wonders if Harry misdiagnosed Max. Ethan overhears them, and offers to provide a second opinion. Harry immediately says that Max is very sick and has to go to an institution, and says that he's never wrong because he's older than Ethan.

Asta talks to Mike and Liv, and Mike wants to know everything Asta has been keeping from him. She says that she didn't know the pad was stolen at first, and thought Sam took it. Then she found the bottle and tells Mike that he should talk to the kid whose passing it around. Asta says that the bottle was prescribed after Sam died.

As Harry leaves, Asta comes out and asks if he was going to leave without saying goodbye. She says that her life is better for having known Harry. She manages to convince Harry to hug her, just as Isabelle comes by. When Asta says that Harry is leaving, Isabelle figures that now he can spend all his time with her and leads him off.

Mike and Liv go to the school and talk to Kate, to ask if they can talk to lanky stoner who is pushing the drugs. The sheriff has Liv wait out in the hallway.

At the 59, Judy talks to D'Arcy about how she thinks she's psychic. Isabelle leads Harry in, and D'Arcy comes over and claims Harry "" checked out her tonsils"". Harry recites all of his patients' medical symptoms, and after D'Arcy goes to get them beers, Isabelle suggests that Harry sell the cabin and go back to NYC with her.

Mike tells the stoner that he can walk out the door anytime and there's no pressure. The stoner just smirks, and Mike calls him a junkie and plays bad cop. Mike doesn't make of an impression on the stoner. Afterward he tells Liv that he couldn't break the stoner. Liv says that she talked to a couple of kids, and they don't know who the dealer is. She got the whole procedure, and Mike says that he deliberately left her outside to find the information. Mike figures that the dealer, known as the Pharmacist, is an insider. Jay comes out and the officers see her, and Liv wonders why Asta left her off the list of suspects. They figure that Jay is their insider.

At the 59, Harry says that he doesn't like it in NYC. Isabelle is surprised, and Harry says that he didn't like 9/11. Ben and Asta bring Ethan in to show him the place. D'Arcy welcomes Ethan to Patience, and offers the toast to the 59. Ethan knows about the 59 died, and Harry speaks up and says that it's 60. He points out that all of the humans were crushed to death when the mine collapses. Ethan suggests that Ethan and Harry can both be her friends, and they should fight over her.

Isabelle comes over and Ethan charms her. Harry figures that Ethan is more attractive than him, and tries to lead Isabelle out. He offers to arm-wrestle Ethan, saying that he beat Isabelle. Ethan agrees, and Harry dislocates Ethan's soldier and considers it a triumph. Nobody else cheers him, and Asta and D'Arcy help Ethan pop his shoulder back in place. Harry tries to get a cheer going for him, without success.

Isabell wakes up, smiles, and turns to Harry in bed... only to discover that he isn't there. She goes out to the kitchen, and finds Harry has made breakfast for her. He says that she was right, that leaving the clinic was the best thing for them. Isabelle wonders what romantic things they'll do, and Harry describes in clinical detail how they'll make love. When he finishes, Isabelle passes out and falls on the floor. Harry, satisfied, drags her away and tosses her on the bed. He tells her that he's going to the mountain and she shouldn't wake up until he gets back... or ever.

D'Arcy wakes up in bed and doesn't know where she is at first. She goes to the kitchen and finds Ethan there, making her breakfast. He says that he had a good time the previous night, and D'Arcy quickly leaves.

At the sheriff's office, Mike puts together photos of all the clues on his murder board and discovers that his pushpins are missing. He goes tin find Liv, who has her own murder board in a closet. Liv denies making a murder board but isn't very convincing. The deputy figures that the botulism was administered with Sam's insulin, since he was diabetic, and only had to wait until Sam injected himself.

Mike tells her that it's not a stupid idea, compliments Liv with a ""good job"", and leaves. Liv is thrilled.

Ethan flies D'Arcy and a helicopter over the mountains, and D'Arcy spots Harry. Harry is using a metal detector to find the missing piece of his ship, and finds it. The helicopter lands nearby, and D'Arcy comes over and tells Harry that he's not allowed on the glacier. Harry tries to smile, and asks D'Arcy if he has a good smile. She cringes at Harry's smile and takes him to the helicopter to fly him out.

Two Months Ago: New Mexico

David maps the ship's trajectory and figures the spaceship is nearby. They stumble across the cloaked ship, and David sprays it with a fire extinguisher from their camper to reveal it. Lisa calls Eleanor and says that they found the UFO.

Now

Asta comes in joins her team at the bowling alley, and she points out that Jimmy is nearby with his ""Russian mail-order bride"", Becky. The team starts bowling, and Liv--one of Asta's teammates--tells Asta that they're going to have to bring her in. Liv warns that whoever stole the pads is maybe someone Asta knows.

Asta approaches Jimmy at the bar, and Jimmy insults her. She says that Sam trusted Jimmy, and suggests that Jimmy stole a prescription pad. He lies, badly, about not stealing it. Becky comes over and collects Jimmy, and Asta tells her that Becky might tell herself that how Jimmy treats her is okay, but it isn't. Jimmy leads Becky out, while Asta's teammates yell at her to call a human trafficking line.

Harry attaches the piece of metal to the rest of his ship. He figures that once he finds his device, he can kill all of the humans and complete his mission. Isabelle comes down, and Harry takes her to the kitchen, makes her some more drugged coffee, and tells Isabelle that she has ""Colorado Fever"". Before Isabelle drinks the coffee, she says that Harry is like a different person. Harry tries to get her to drink the coffee, but she goes to lie down and sip on the coffee. Once Harry hears Isabelle collapses on the bedroom floor, he leaves the cabin.

One Week Ago: New Mexico

The Air Force secure the spaceship site, and Eleanor arrives. Lisa and Dave show her the invisible UFO, and Eleanor figure that they're playing a game. They reveal the light under UV light, and ELEANOR takes out the photos she took as a child and realizes that it's the same ship. She tells her soldiers to secure the crash site.

The Present

Eleanor tells David and Lisa that when the alien comes back, she wants them to bring it to her. Harry comes back to get his ship, and a sniper draws a bead on him. Lisa and David are watching, and Lisa tells the soldiers to bring Harry in and kill him if he tries to run."

One piece hits Earth.

The rock falls to the bottom of an ocean, and an octopus-like alien emerges grows from it.

Two Weeks Ago

The alien floats in a tank at the Patience bowling alley.

A Jeep approaches Harry in the New Mexico desert and stops just before hitting him. Isabelle gets out and asks Harry what's going on, while the Army sniper watches both of them and wonder who Isabelle is. The sniper asks if he should open fire, and David tells him not to.

Harry greets Isabelle and says that he thought she was napping. Isabelle points out that Harry slipped her sleeping pills, and explains that she faked falling asleep so she could follow Harry there. She asks why Harry drugged her, and why he's in the middle of the desert. Harry realizes that they're being watched, and tells Isabelle that he came out there because he needed space, so he took a drive, ended up in a ""random place"", and is enjoying the space and dirt.

Lisa and David listen in from their camper, and Isabelle tells Harry that she hopes he finds his space and leaves. Harry doesn't understand why she's going if she's ""his gal"", and the two agents figure it's a marital squabble. Lisa orders the sniper to shoot Harry anyway, and David gives a countermanding order.

Harry starts to drive, and figures out humans have his spaceship, know he's there, and are searching for him. He drives back to his cabin and goes inside, where he finds Isabelle packing. He says that they should talk, and he asks what she's making for dinner. Isabelle says that she's leaving him, and Harry points out that she's still there. He wants Isabelle to stay so she can make him food because he's hungry. Isabelle refuses to stay. Harry to say that he drugged her because he was trying to be kind. Isabelle asks him if he ever loved her, and Harry says ""once"". She thanks him for being honest for once and leaves. Harry sits down and contemplates his empty stomach.

The next day at the clinic, Asta asks Ethan if he's seen Max's file and Harry's diagnosis of ""terrorphobia"". Asta says that Max has never reacted like how he is before. She asks if Ethan thinks it's extreme that Harry is sending Max away, but Ethan doesn't see the problem since his parents sent him away for lacrosse. As he walks away, Asta finds Ethan's advice less than helpful.

Mike and Liv question the nurse about Jay, who says that Jay was always quiet like she was planning something. Once she microwaved a fish in the breakroom. Asta comes in, and the nurse tells her that the sheriff thinks Jay stole the prescription pad. After Asta says that Jay is innocent, Mike points out that someone calling themselves ""The Pharmacist"" stole a pad and probably killed Sam.

Liv points out that they're not so sure, and as Mike calls her on it Asta walks out. Mike and Liv go after her, and Mike asks who else might have done it. Asta insists that it wasn't Jay and walks away, and bumps into Ben. Once she walks around him, Ben congratulates Mike on his theory. Mike takes credit for Mike's theory, and after Ben leaves Mike asks Liv why she's acting so strange.

Harry goes out into the mountain and searches for his device. He wonders if the humans have his device as well as his spaceship, and throws himself down in the snow in frustration. Harry considers how humans deal with failure, and goes back to the cabin and takes some pills with alcohol. He starts giggling and then passes out.

Later, Harry wakes up and hears a steak sizzling. He goes to investigate and finds an imaginary human Harry cooking. Undead-Harry says that he's cooking one of the steaks Harry packed him in, refuses to make him a steak, and says that Harry is a loser. Harry insists that he's a loser, but Undead-Harry points out that he's human, and the human race has destroyed Harry. Undead-Harry stabs at Harry's throat with a knife, and Harry wakes up and Undead-Harry comes at him with a knife and tells him that he's still dreaming. Harry finally wakes up.

At their house, Ben and Kate show Max a video of the Donnelly Institute they want to send him to. When the video is done, he wonders why they hate him. Max asks if Harry called them, and Kate says that Ethan is the new doctor and he approved the paperwork. Kate says that their decision is final, and Max storms out.

Harry goes to the diner and laments being a human while looking for jobs in the newspaper. Max joins him and reminds Harry that they had a truce. Harry admits that he's not good at truces, and has a lot to do to be human. Max tells him not to have alien stuff in the back of his truck and leaves.

At the 59, Asta and D'Arcy play pool and D'Arcy wonders why Asta didn't tell the police that Jimmy stole the pad. She points out that she didn't have any proof, and D'Arcy tells her that Asta should trust her instincts. Judy calls from the bowling alley where Harry is playing a machine and refuses to leave. Judy says that Harry applied for a job but was overqualified.

Asta and D'Arcy come over, and Harry tells them that Isabelle left him and he's lost his job. He says that he's tried booze and pills, and D'Arcy suggests pot. They sit on the bowling alley, smoke pot, and then eat. A lot. Harry is still depressed but says that he doesn't care. Harry sees the octopus in the tank and goes over. The octopus calls Harry ""cousin"" and telepathically says that it's been waiting for him

The octopus alien says that things are getting bad for them. Harry tells it that he's failed at his mission. Asta and D'Arcy see him and figure that he's just high. Asta wonders if Harry is a sociopath.

The alien tells Harry that he has to complete his mission and help them. It realizes that Harry is high, then apologizes for putting pressure on Harry. Harry figures that Max can help him, and tells the alien not to tell any of their people that he crashed.

As Harry leaves, Asta and D'Arcy go over and study another octopus.

Max is in bed when Harry breaks in, sits on Max's bed, and steals some chips to eat. The boy wakes up, and Harry asks Max how he knew about the alien stuff in his truck since there was a blanket covering it. Max says that there was a green glow, and Harry figures that it's part of the same genetic mutation that lets Max see Harry's real form. He wants Max to help him find his device, and Max says that he's not helping Harry unless Harry gets him out of going to Donnelly. Harry agrees and asks Max to have Kate get some popcorn.

The next day at the sheriff's station, Mike sits with Cletus and tells the dog that they'll put them on 'Deadline' for solving Sam's murder. Asta comes in and tells them that Jimmy stole the pad, and Mike is thrilled that they have a lead.

Harry goes to the clinic, meets with Ethan, calls in Ben and Kate, and says that he misdiagnosed Max and the boy just has an over-active imagination. Ben is thrilled, but Kate not so much and accuses Harry of driving a wedge between her and Ben. Ben is surprised to learn that, and Ethan says that sometimes doctors--but not him--sometimes make mistakes. The couple leave and Harry goes as well.

Two Weeks Ago: New Mexico

Eleanor, Lisa, and David consider how to open the spaceship. Eleanor agrees to give David more time, but tells him not to make her regret it.

Now

Max finds Harry in the library and tells the alien that his parents aren't sending him away. Harry shows him a photo of his spaceship, but Max can't see the green glow in the photo. However, Max can see the glow on an actual piece of the spaceship, and Harry says that he'll construct something to assist Max's eyeballs. Max asks what the device does, and Harry tells him that it will kill him before correcting himself and claiming that it's a radio.

At the station, Mike interrogates Jimmy and accuses him of poisoning Sam when Sam caught Jimmy stealing the pad. Jimmy denies it, and Liv and Jimmy discuss bosses that don't listen to them. Mike interrupts and asks what Liv wants to say to him, and she tells him that someone who plans a delayed murder isn't an idiot that steals pad. She suggests that the Pharmacist only wanted to sell drugs to kids.

Mike is offended that the Pharmacist sold drugs to kids and didn't know he was doing it.

Max lets Harry into the school, and Harry wears a mustache disguise. They go to the science lab to get a radioscope, and Harry steals it, a radio, and a telescope. They start to leave but duck out of sight when Mike and Liv pass looking for the Pharmacist, a janitor named Richard Ferguson.

When they find Ferguson and Mike announces that they know his secret identity, Ferguson runs. Mike chases after him, and Liv calmly gets in front of Ferguson and trips him with a broom. She tells Mike that she used to go to the school and knows all the shortcuts, and Mike reads Ferguson his rights as he leads him off.

At the hangar, David studies an ancient races' amulet and spots a glowing green object. He tells Eleanor and Lisa that the race claimed that they got their technology from an ancient race, and then their civilization disappeared. He figures the alien who owns the spaceship came there to kill everyone.

At home, Ben makes Kate some tea as a peace offering and asks if she's feeling any better. Kate says nothing, and Ben assures her that she's a great mother. His wife doesn't believe it, and Ben lights the candled that he made to calm her. Kate asks him to tell her that she's wrong, and she needs a partner that challenges him. Ben tells Kate that she was wrong about sending Max away, and Kate smiles and kisses him. Ben says that at times Kate can be a little controlling and he continues on until she gets upset with him and walks away.

Mike goes to the diner to eat, and Liv sits down with him and tells him the paperwork is done. She's thrilled that they worked together to capture Ferguson. Mike finally tells her that her behavior was a little disrespectful because the Miranda rights are her things and she tried to take it for herself. He also doesn't think Liv has been nice to Cletus. The waitress brings Mike's to-go order over, and Liv takes it, pounds it flat, and tells Mike that he has never been respectful to. She finally tells Mike that she quits, takes the to-go with her, yells at Mike to shut up, and storms out.

Harry and Max go to the clock tower, and Harry hooks up the equipment to the telescope and centers it on the mountain. Max sees the metal that Harry showed him earlier, then looks into the telescope and looks for the device. The boy spots a green glow and Harry tracks its location. It's on the glacier, and Harry tells him to get his bag.

As they walk down the street, Asta tells D'Arcy that it doesn't feel good that she told the police about Jimmy. D'Arcy says that they stopped a high school drug ring. Harry goes out to his truck, and Max tries to stop him, saying it's too dangerous. Asta and D'Arcy overhear Max as he yells after Harry to stop, but Harry keeps driving. The two women go over to Max and Asta asks him what he was doing with Harry. Max finally tells them that Harry is going to the glacier, and then runs off.

On the glacier, Harry searches for his device and figures that when he returns to his home planet, they'll erect statues to him. He remembers that his race doesn't know how to sculpt, and figures that a true hero doesn't need statues but maybe just a plaque... and finds the device.

Max goes home, sits on his bed, and looks at the metal piece he took from Harry's bag.

Asta and D'Arcy take snowmobiles up to the glacier and spot Harry.

Harry pulls the key piece out of the device.

The piece of debris sparks and Max drops it.

At the army hangar, the lights go out and the ship activates, waves of green energy going across it. David figures that something initiated it, tracked the signal and he exclaims that he knows where the alien is.

Asta and D'Arcy pull up near Harry and tell him not to move. He says that he was just shopping for snow and they can go, just as the ice beneath him breaks and they all fall into a crevasse."
