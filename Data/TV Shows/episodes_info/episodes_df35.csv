Walt supplements his low teaching salary by working part-time at a local car wash, where he ends up being humiliated in front of two of the students he teaches. On his 50th birthday, Walt returns home to a surprise party arranged by Skyler (Anna Gunn). The following day, he collapses at the car wash and is raced to the hospital, where he is told that he has developed inoperable lung cancer and has, at best, two years to live. Walt opts to keep this news from his family and from Skyler's sister Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt) and her husband Hank (Dean Norris), a DEA agent.

After returning to work at the car wash, Walt suddenly lashes out at his boss and walks off the job. Having earlier seen a news report showing a large amount of money recovered from one of Hank's drug busts, Walt takes up a previous offer to go on a ride-along as Hank and his partner Steven Gomez (Steven Michael Quezada) raid a known Meth lab. As the DEA agents clear out the house, Walt observes his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) sneaking out a back window. Later, Walt tracks down Jesse's address and blackmails him into helping him produce crystal Meth without revealing why. Walt turns over his life savings to allow Jesse to purchase a Fleetwood Bounder RV to use as a mobile lab. Walt then steals supplies from the high school chemistry lab needed for the process.

Walt and Jesse drive the RV into the desert and begin to cook. Walt's expertise in chemistry enables them to create crystal Meth that Jesse claims is the purest he's ever seen. Jesse drives back into town to show a sample to his distributor, Krazy-8 Molina (Maximino Arciniega). He realizes too late that Krazy-8 is a cousin of Emilio Koyama, his partner that was busted on the earlier raid and now free on bail. Emilio believes Jesse abandoned him, but Jesse promises to prove his loyalty by driving them to the RV. When they meet Walt, Emilio recognizes him from the raid and thinks that he is an informant, leading him and Krazy-8 to hold the two at gunpoint. Jesse tries to run but trips and falls and hits his head on rock, knocking himself out. Walt barters for his life by offering to show them how he produced the Meth. As they watch Walt inside the RV, Emilio flicks away a cigarette outside, which causes a brush fire to ignite. Walt surprises Emilio and Krazy-8 by synthesizing deadly Phosphine gas, flees the RV, holds the door shut which causes Emilio and Krazy-8 to pass out.

Hearing sirens in the distance, Walt quickly dons a gas mask and puts one on Jesse before pulling him into the RV's passenger seat, still filled with Phosphine fumes. Walt frantically drives the RV away from the spreading brush fire. As shown in medias stories at the start of the episode, Walt drives the RV into a ditch and stumbles out of the vehicle, discarding his gas mask. Believing that he is about to be captured by the police, Walt records a video message to his family before trying to shoot himself with a pistol, unaware the safety is still on.

As the sirens near, Walt is relieved to find they are only fire engines responding to the fire, and quickly hides his weapon. Jesse wakes up and joins Walt as they watch the fire engines race by. The two have the RV extracted from the ditch by a Native American man with a front-end loader and then drive back into town, making sure Emilio and Krazy-8 are secured in the RV before leaving it at Jesse's home. Later that night, Walt returns home and meets his wife's troubled queries with a new sexual vigor, which leaves her asking, ""Walt, is that you?"""

Walt wants this to be his first and last Meth cook, and he promises to Jesse that they will go their separate ways. When they open the RV to remove the two bodies inside, they notice that Krazy-8 is still breathing. After parking the RV at Jesse's place, Walt had returned home (and had vigorous sex with his wife). Jesse calls him the next morning in a state of panic as Krazy-8 is still alive and locked up inside the RV. Walt promises to drop by after school, where he picks up bottles of Hydrofluoric acid. Meanwhile Krazy-8 escapes from the RV and is found by Walt on the streets, as he drives towards Jesse's home. Krazy-8 knocks himself out while trying to escape from Walt. Walt loads him into his car and drives towards Jesse's house

The unconscious Krazy-8 is taken into the basement and secured to a pole with a bike lock around his neck. Walt suggests that they should use Hydrofluoric acid to dissolve Emilio's corpse so that it leaves no evidence behind. Walt and Jesse must dispose of the corpse and kill Krazy-8, and toss a coin to see who will do which task. Jesse wins and chooses to dispose of the corpse, leaving Walt to kill Krazy-8.

Walt instructs Jesse to buy a bin made from polyethylene in which the corpse can be properly dissolved, but Jesse cannot find a bin big enough to accommodate the entire body. Walt is thinking about suffocating Krazy-8 but cannot bring himself to kill another human being. So, he ends up giving him water, food and bathroom supplies instead.

When Jesse returns home and asks how the murder went, Walt promises to take care of Krazy-8 the next day and leaves for home. Meanwhile, Skyler (Anna Gunn) begins to suspect that Walt is doing something in secret. Skyler uses an internet service to trace the address of the phone number which called Walt in the morning at breakfast. On Jess 's website she has learned that he is a drug dealer and a pimp for MILFs (she doesn't know what a MILF is).

Walter and Skyler go for an ultrasound together and find that they are having a girl. Skyler questions Walt as to who Jesse is as Walt was acting very weird during the phone call. Walt makes up a lie saying that Jesse sells him marijuana (due to his pain from the cancer). Skyler confronts Jesse at his home, while he is trying to dispose of Emilio (he was moving Emilio's body from the RV into the house), warning him that her brother-in-law is a DEA agent. Skyler doesn't even notice the corpse that was partially hidden behind Jesse's car.

Jesse does not find the specific plastic bin Walt instructed him to use, so he decides to dissolve the corpse in his bathtub. However, the ceramic and metal bathtub get dissolved by the Hydrofluoric acid along with the body and causes the ceiling beneath it to collapse, followed by Emilio's liquefied remains. Walt tells Jesse that Hydrofluoric acid will dissolve anything except plastic. Meanwhile, two Native American children play out in the desert and find Walt's gas mask."

In the meanwhile, Krazy-8 regains consciousness in the basement. While talking with Walt, Krazy-8 reveals that Jesse told him and Emilio about Walt's personal life. That Walter is a Chemistry teacher in school and has a retarded son. Krazy-8 tells Walter that Jesse is not a reliable partner and that he blabbed about Walter to him and his cousin (Emilio). Krazy-8 that either Walt lets him go or he would have to kill Krazy-8 in cold blood. Walt then confronts Jesse, in the middle of getting high off Meth. Walt tries to flush down the cooked Meth that it worth roughly $ 40,000, but Jesse saves it as Walt gets out of breath very quickly due to his lung cancer. Jesse berates him for not living up to his end of the bargain between the two and drives off.

Meanwhile, Skyler tells Marie that she is working on a new short story with a stoner character in it and she asks her about marijuana. Marie assumes that Skyler thinks Walt Jr. is smoking pot, but Skyler insists that she was just talking about her story. Marie asks Hank to scare Walt Jr. straight, leading him to bring Walt Jr. to a motel to show how Meth has corroded the teeth of a prostitute. Turns out Jesse was hiding in the room of the prostitute while she was being interrogated by Hank outside Jesse gets paranoid that the cops are already looking for him.

Meanwhile it is shown that Marie is a kleptomaniac as she steals a pair of stilettos from a high-end store.

Walt phones Skyler to apologize for being late, falsely claiming that he's working over at the car wash. Skyler informs Walt that she knows he quit his job there two weeks previously and angrily tells him to not come home.

Walt weighs the pros and cons of killing Krazy-8, then collapses on the basement floor while bringing him a sandwich, shattering the plate. After he regains consciousness, Walt tells Krazy-8 he has lung cancer. After engaging in conversation with Krazy-8, Walter seemingly forms a bond with him. Krazy-8 says that his real name is Domingo. Walt says that he is looking for any reason not to kill Krazy-8. Krazy-8 promises not to come after Walt, if he is set free. Krazy-8 grew up in town and has a business management degree. His father owns a furniture shop that Walt knows very well. Walt bought a bassinet there when his son was born. Walt decides to let him go free and shares a beer with him. Walt admits that he is cooking Meth as he wants to leave some money for his family before he dies. Walt goes to get the key to the bike lock which is holding him captive.

However, when Walter throws the beer can in the trash, he observes the broken pieces of the plate. He realizes that there is a shard missing from the broken plate. He reluctantly garrotes Krazy-8 with the bike lock while he stabs backward into Walt's leg with the broken plate. Walt goes back home to find Skyler sitting on the bed, crying. He says he has something to tell her.

Meanwhile, Hank and several DEA agents discover the cook site in the desert along with Krazy-8's car. Inside the car they find the small bag of crystal Meth cooked by Walt. The family of Native Americans shares the lab mask the young girl found in the previous episode. It is revealed that Krazy-8 was working for Hank undercover."

Hank also reports on their discovery of 99.15% pure methamphetamine. Such purity has never been achieved before. Although the DEA had no leads, Hank believes the product is good enough to make someone Albuquerque's new Meth kingpin (unaware that it is Walt). Meanwhile, Walt tells Hank, Marie, and Walt Jr. about his cancer; Skyler has already been told. Walt reveals that he has cancer at a family barbecue & uses that as an excuse with Skyler for his strange behavior. Marie arranges an appointment with the best oncologist in the country. But the family needs money for the treatment and Walter is against borrowing it from Hank or his mother. Jesse smokes Walt's Meth with two friends and flees his house the next morning when he hallucinates that two religious evangelists at his door are armed bikers.

Marie makes an appointment with one of the top oncologists in the country, even though the family can't afford him. Walt says he will take the money out from his pension, but he actually uses some of the money taken from Krazy-8 who offered him in the desert, which he keeps hidden in an air-conditioning duct at his house. Walt Jr. berates his father for acting so weird and nonchalant about his cancer. When Walt goes to his credit union to put the cash in a cashier's check, his parking spot is stolen by a rich, obnoxious man named Ken (Kyle Bornheimer). Ken annoys Walt and the rest of the customers with his loud cell phone conversation.

Jesse ends up fleeing to his affluent parents' house, where he sleeps for an entire day. He attempts to bond with his overachieving little brother, Jake (Benjamin Petry). That night, Jesse gets a call from one of the friends who smoked Walt's Meth, who says that he knows a lot of upper-class people looking to score drugs and are willing to pay top dollar for the high-quality Meth he cooked. The next day, Jesse visits Walt to ""touch base,"" but he kicks Jesse out. Jesse then brusquely gives Walt his half of the Meth profit - $4,000. Jesse pays Walter his share of the money from the 1st batch and the partnership seems to be over. The oncologist tells Walt that the cancer has spread to his lymph nodes, but there is a chance it is still treatable with chemotherapy.

At home, Walt expresses his doubts about the chemo since it will cost $90,000 and if he still dies, he will leave his family with all the debt. Walt Jr. admonishes his dad, saying that he should just die if he's going to give up so easily. At the Pinkman residence, a housekeeper finds a joint in Jesse's room, resulting in his parents kicking him out. It turns out the joint belonged to Jake, who thanks Jesse for taking the fall for him. While Jesse is waiting out front for his ride after his parents kick him out for the marijuana, Jake comes out asking for his joint back, which Jesse throws on and stomps into the ground.

Walt suffers a coughing attack while driving and coughs up blood. As he pulls into a gas station, he notices Ken pull up. When Ken leaves his car unattended, an angry Walt takes a squeegee, pops open Ken's hood, and shorts the car battery with it. The engine subsequently overheats, and the car explodes as Walt walks back to his car. He then calmly drives away, leaving an exasperated Ken."

Years earlier, Walt and his then-girlfriend Gretchen (Jessica Hecht) had formed a company called Gray Matter Technologies with Elliott-the company name derived from mixing the colors in their last names, ""White"" and ""Schwartz"" (German for ""black"")-but Walt opted to sell off his share.

Subsequently, the company had flourished off Walt's innovations, and Elliott married Gretchen. Walt is tense at the birthday party due to this troubled past. But Elliot is nothing but nice to Walter and goes out of his way to make Walter feel comfortable. When Elliott offers him a job and tells him Gray Matter has excellent health insurance, Walt realizes that Skyler told Elliott about his cancer and gets upset with her for talking about his private affairs to people who are not in their lives anymore. Walt says that when he declined the job offer and Elliot flat out offered to pay for the treatment and Walter found that demeaning.

Jesse has a failed job interview. Jesse is only being considered for entry level job positions like being a human advertising board, despite him having education and a solid sales background. After the interview, Jesse meets his friend Badger outside the office. Badger wants some of the pure Meth that Jesse had, but Jesse says it's all gone now, and he had a falling out with his partner who actually cooked the Meth. Badgers says he can guarantee a major supply of Pseudo that is needed as a core ingredient of Meth.

Jesse shows his friend Badger (Matt L. Jones) the RV Walt and Jesse use as a Meth lab. Badger and Jesse decide to cook a batch on their own. In the desert, Jesse is frustrated he can't cook Meth as well as Walt (the end output is very cloudy, while it was clean as glass when Walter cooked it) and throws his own product away, much to Badger's disgust. Badger believes that the product was good enough to be sold. Jesse cooks a few more batches, which he also eventually throws away. Badger and Jesse brawl over the Meth, and Jesse pushes him out of the RV and drives away.

Over the weekend, Walt Jr. and two friends are waiting outside a convenience store, waiting for somebody to buy them beer. The friends run away when Walt Jr. approaches a random person who turns to be an off-duty cop. The cop tells him he got his ""first and last warning"" and hands him off to Hank, who Walt Jr. calls as his ""father"". Skyler holds an intervention for Walt, where she says she doesn't understand why Walt refuses treatment. Walt Jr. is angry with Walt and says that he feels Walt is giving up and he could be giving up on Walt Jr. in the future. Hank, Walt Jr. and Marie argue over what to do: while Skyler and Walt Jr. want him to take the treatment, Marie, and later Hank, feel Walt should be given the choice to decline the treatment if he wants. Walt ends the intervention saying he will not do the treatment.

The next morning, Walt has a change of heart and tells Skyler he will do the treatment, and he will take care of Elliott's check (that he has given for Walter's treatment). Later Gretchen calls, telling him that Walter has to accept the money. Walt says he appreciates the offer but lies and says his insurance will now cover it. It is also implied that Gretchen and Walter used to be in a relationship back when. Walt then goes to Jesse's house and asks him if he wants to cook."
