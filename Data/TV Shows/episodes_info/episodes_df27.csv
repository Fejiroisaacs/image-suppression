To control this portal, he perfects a timer which allows him to return safely after each slide. Together with his good friend Wade Welles and his professor Maximillian Arturo, he intends to use this new invention to do a bit of exploring. A power overload inadvertently sucks washed-up singer Rembrandt Brown into the vortex as he drives by Quinn's house, and all four are deposited into an icy San Francisco. Quinn believes they should wait the five hours he'd preset the timer for initially, but an ice tornado forces their hand. What they believe to be home is really another parallel dimension, this one dominated by the Soviet Union.

Rembrandt is arrested for using rebel currency and Wade is found out to be an alternate of an America rebel leader who is being held prisoner. A plan is hatched to rescue both Rembrandt and alt-Wade by having Arturo pose as the warden of the penitentiary. The raid is successful, though not without casualties. Quinn repairs the timer and the four slide again, only to find that they've become untethered in the multiverse."

Dan Larsen (Don Knight) is being pursued at high speeds by a police car out in the countryside. With him is Celeste Caro (Josie Over), who seemingly regains consciousness and starts to attack him. She eventually jumps out of the car to escape him and rolls to the side of the road as Larsen speeds away.

Later, McGarrett arrives on the scene along with the Consul-General (Ed Fernandez). When an HPD cop gives McGarrett an expensive-looking earring that Celeste was wearing, McGarrett asks the Consul whether this was ""part of the stuff you might be looking for."" The Consul says, ""Yes, it is ours."" McGarrett asks an attending doctor what are Celeste's chances. The doctor shakes his head negatively. Before she expires, in response to McGarrett's questions about where she got the jewelry, Celeste whispers several times, ""The ways of love...""

ACT ONE

The Consul-General tells McGarrett that he never saw Celeste before. He is concerned that the crown jewels from his country -- which were displayed in Hawaii only after considerable hesitation -- have not been recovered, having been stolen 8 days before.

Celeste's landlady tells Williams about Larsen kidnapping Celeste. She called the police as Larsen -- a ""blond man"" -- dragged Celeste to his car. McGarrett arrives and the Five-O crew check out Celeste's room, which contains several of her paintings and sketches. A piece of paper in an envelope addressed to Dave Barca, Box 2469, Solareo, California, reads ""Dear Dave, The ways of love are strange. The vows of love."" An envelope containing unexposed X-ray film is found.

Back at the Five-O office, the Attorney-General Walter Stewart (Morgan White) pushes McGarrett to recover the missing jewels because he is getting ""pressure from Washington."" Danno has determined that Dave Barca's address is a county jail where Barca is waiting for a hearing on fugutive charges. Barca was picked up in Honolulu two days after the jewel theft, charged with parole violation. He was caught going through a red light, driving Celeste's car without a license. Barca served time in San Quentin for felonious assault and forgery. Stewart asks McGarrett if he wants to go to the mainland.

The next scene takes place in Barca's (James Patterson) cell in California. McGarrett enters in disguise as a prisoner named ""Steve Crowley.""

ACT TWO

McGarrett as Crowley says he just got out of a ""lousy Air Force jail."" He has been arrested for armed robbery.

In Hawaii, Larsen's car is dredged out of a river. In the trunk Five-O finds X-ray equipment.

The chatty ""Crowley"" is getting no response from Barca, trying several ways to befriend him.

In the Five-O office, an X-ray technician named Jimmy (Robert Costa) says the equipment recovered from the car trunk looks like the kind which can see through heavy steel plate.

McGarrett listens to a radio in the cell. A news item (bogusly inserted) tells about the Honolulu jewel robbery and how Celeste was killed. McGarrett has an appointment with the prison dentist.

McGarrett plans his strategy with the help of prison officials. He takes a knife from the ""dentist's"" office. Back in the cell, McGarrett shows Barca the knife, and says that during his court appearance the next day, he intends to ""leave.""

In the Five-O office, Jimmy demonstrates how the X-ray machine can see through a safe to determine the combination. Using the resulting picture of the tumbler action, Danno opens a test safe.

While on their way to court, McGarrett and Barca overpower a guard in the elevator and escape over the prison roof. As they flee, guards fire shots at them.

ACT THREE

At his ""girl friend's"" place, McGarrett looks for money. He mentions the free flights which Air Force people can take. Barca wants to know more.

In Hawaii, the body of ""Jack Wade,"" an X-ray technician known for preparing fake X-ray plates to falsify insurance claims, is found dead on the beach. One of his partners is known to be Larsen.

Barca wants to go to Hawaii using the Air Force flight scam. McGarrett says they have to catch a plane at nearby Travis Field. Barca convinces McGarrett to go by saying ""I'll make you rich."" McGarrett tells Barca they need mimeographed flight orders. They break into a printing company and manufacture these papers.

The two men arrive in Hawaii, followed by Danno and Kono, and take a cab to a boat called Scuba Belle anchored at a marina. Barca looks unsuccessfully for the jewelry under the floorboards. He tells McGarrett that he'll pay $25,000 to help find Larsen. He gives McGarrett a gun.

ACT FOUR

McGarrett, driven to Larsen's place by Danno and Chin, knocks on Larsen's door, pretending to be drunk. When Larsen opens the door, he forces Larsen at gunpoint to come back to the Scuba Belle, where Barca beats Larsen, trying to get him to reveal the location of the jewels. Larsen says Celeste never told him anything.

Using Larsen's girl friend's car, the three men go to Celeste's place as the Five-O team -- who are following them -- hide outside. Barca finds the ""ways of love"" message, and shoots Larsen, saying that Celeste never double-crossed him. Five-O lays low while Barca and McGarrett escape.

Barca and McGarrett go to a temple near the ocean. Barca tells McGarrett to wait in the car, but McGarrett follows him and watches as Barca talks to a priest. The priest says that ""the girl"" that Barca came with before left him something. He gives Barca a box which contains the jewels. Barca looks at the jewels by the ocean. When McGarrett speaks up, Barca draws a gun, and McGarrett shoots him. McGarrett identifies himself as a cop as Barca expires, saying, ""The vows of love ... she did love me."""

Next to the bed, Barry removes the silencer from his gun and leaves. A montage shows Barry: on a plane; entering his apartment; in the shower; and, playing a video game. A plaque in the room shows he is a combat veteran.

Sleeping, Barry is awakened by Fuches, who congratulates Barry on finishing the hit job. Barry says he is burnt out. Fuches suggests he travel to Los Angeles for a new assignment.

Barry flies to Los Angeles and meets Chechen mob members. He is told by Goran and NoHo Hank, that Barry must kill Ryan Madison , a personal trainer with whom Goran's wife is cheating.

Next, Barry follows Ryan to a community center. After some time, Barry approaches the building and hears a woman yelling. After he approaches, she chastises him and runs into the building. Barry follows her into a theater where a man and the woman he just interrupted are on stage performing. The theater teacher, Gene M. Cousineau insults Sally, the female student, then encourages her to finish the scene, which she does with fervor.

Approaching him from behind, Ryan Madison asks Barry to be his scene partner. The two are next shown on-stage reciting lines. After Barry blankly reads his lines from a script, Cousineau tells Barry he must pay to attend class.

As Barry leaves the building, Sally invites him to join the students at a bar. At the bar, she and the acting students (Nick, Jermaine, Antonio, Sasha, Natalie, Lydia, and Ryan), brainstorm a monologue Barry can prepare for class. Ryan Madison suggests that Barry use a stage name and recommends Barry Block. Barry drives an inebriated Ryan home. Across the street, NoHo Hank and a Chechen associate watch from a car as Ryan hugs Barry.

The next morning, Fuches tells Barry what NoHo Hank saw. Barry explains that he wants to pursue acting. Fuches says that Barry must complete the job and forget acting.

Now nighttime, Barry approaches Cousineau outside the community center. Barry confesses he is a hitman and tells Cousineau that he is depressed. Cousineau assumes this monologue was from a written work and tells Barry he can be in the class. Barry tells him his last name is Block.

Later, Barry watches Ryan pull up outside Ryan's apartment. Barry opens Ryan's car door to shoot him, and sees he's already been shot in the head. He turns around to see a Chechen reloading a weapon from a car where NoHo Hank instructs him to shoot Barry. Barry shoots all the men. He throws away the gun and his car keys as he walks away. He walks into a nearby restaurant as police sirens fill the air."

This is where we meet for the first time Ted, Lily, Marshall, Barney and Robin.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Pamela Fryman'],"['', '']",[],"['new york city', 'popping a cork', ""throwing a drink in someone's face"", 'woman wears a red dress', 'eye patch', 'year 2030', 'canadian abroad', 'champagne bottle', 'kiss', 'saying i love you', 'dalmatian', 'french horn', 'olive', 'woman with a black eye', ""men's suit"", 'sex on the kitchen floor', '27 year old', 'hand print on breast']",[],"In 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) is telling his teen-aged children Penny (Lyndsy Fonseca) & Luke (David Henrie) the story of how he met their mother. They are not amused.

The story flashes back to 2005, where 27-year-old Ted (Josh Radnor) helps his best friend and roommate Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) prepare to propose to his girlfriend, Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan). Lily had just come home from her school, where a 5 yr old went to second base with her on finger painting day. Marshall is too scared to open a bottle of champagne, but manages to propose to Lily and they have sex on the kitchen floor

Ted is just starting his career as an architect and lives in New York. Ted and Marshall are college friends. Marshall is studying to be a lawyer Ted was there when Marshall met Lily in college and witnessed their first night together (he was on the top bunk)

At MacLaren's pub, Ted confides to his friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) that their engagement has made him reconsider his life and made him realize that he wants to get married. Barney, a womanizer who despises relationships, insists that Ted should remain single so that he can continue being his ""wingman"". Barney believes that Lebanese girls are new half Asians. Barney had met Ted at the urinal of the bar for the very time and decided to take him under his ""wings"". Barney loves to dress in suits and hates marriage

He introduces Ted to a woman using one of his catchphrases-""Have you met Ted?"". Ted and the woman talk (Yasmine, who is Lebanese), and he asks her out, but it turns out that she is going out with the bartender, Carl (Joe Nieves). Ted then sees Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders) across the bar, with whom he is instantly smitten. Robin is a reporter for Metro News One who wants to cover important news, but is now covering inconsequential local human interest stories (monkey who can play the ukulele). Ted asks her out to dinner, but she says that she will be out of town for a week. Ted asks her to dinner the following night, and she accepts.

Ted's perfect woman loves dog (Robin has 5), loves scotch (loves scotch old enough to order its own scotch) and can quote obscure lines from the Ghosbusters and hates olives (which is perfectly balances since Ted loves them)

Ted and Robin hit it off at dinner (where she is impressed by the blue french horn hanging on the wall), and she then invites Ted to her apartment (to take away her last jar of olives). Just as Ted is about to make his move, however, Robin is called in to cover a news story. Back at MacLaren's, Ted's friends tell him that he should have kissed Robin before she left as she was giving him the obvious sign of a prolonged stare while they shook hands when he said he's a good hand shaker. Ted, accompanied by the gang, goes to her apartment, after stopping by the restaurant where they had their first date and stealing the blue French horn that she had admired. Ranjit (Marshall Manesh) is their cab driver, he is from Bangladesh. While waiting in the cab, when Lily goes to the bathroom, Barney confronts Marshall that he saw him eating olives just 2 weeks ago. Marshall admits that when they first met (when he was 18 and still a virgin), Lily asked for his olives and he blurted that he hated them.

When Robin gets off work, she and Ted resume their date. Just as they are about to kiss, however, Ted tells her that he is in love with her, destroying his chances with her. After a lingering goodbye, he returns to MacLaren's with the gang, assuming that he will never see her again. Future Ted tells his children, ""And that's the story of how I met your... Aunt Robin""; with this, he mentions Robin's name for the first time. The children are confused, as they had assumed he was talking about their mother. Ted reminds them that ""it's a long story""."

A week has gone by since that incident, and Ted (Josh Radnor), hoping to avoid any awkwardness between them, decides not to try to call her. However, he and Marshall (Jason Segel) find Robin in MacLaren's hanging out with Lily (Alyson Hannigan) who recognized her from the news. After Robin leaves, Lily lets slip that Robin told Lily that she was interested in Ted, but she's looking for something ""casual"" and he is not. Ted decides to try to be casual in his pursuit of Robin.

On Friday afternoon, Ted sees Robin on the news covering a kid stuck inside a crane machine at a bodega nearby (he was trying to win a purple giraffe), and sprints over to meet Robin. When Robin sees him, he casually says that he's buying dip for a party they're hosting and invites Robin as well. The party was scheduled for the following Friday, but he changed it to the current Friday when Robin says she is visiting her family the following weekend. This puts Marshall in a bind, as he has a 25-page paper on constitutional law due on Monday that he hasn't even started (and he must also contend with Lily who is so happy to be engaged that she is always in the mood for love), but he gamely goes ahead with the party.

Ted plans to play casual with Robin and get her to the roof. The roof takes care of the rest (the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline) Barney (Neil Patrick Harris), meanwhile, tries to convince Ted to pick up a random girl at the party, since as a rule there is always one person at every New York City party who does not know anyone else, the perfect one night stand. Ted declines, so Barney finds said random girl and hooks up with her himself. In the end, Robin doesn't show up.

Ted impulsively tells Robin that the party will continue Saturday night as well, putting Marshall further behind the eight ball and subjecting Barney to a reunion with his random hook-up. Barney gets rid of her by telling her he's in love with her, as Ted did with Robin. Once again, Robin fails to come to the party, and on Sunday morning, Ted tells her the party will continue that night as well in a final, desperate Hail Mary attempt to woo her.

The party on Sunday is sparsely attended, and Marshall loses his temper when his law book, which he needs for his paper that is now due the next morning, is used as a coaster. He angrily lashes out at Ted for throwing three parties for Robin, realizing too late that she is present this time. Ted covers by lying to Robin and telling her that he wanted her to meet another guy, Carlos (who had been mentioned but who none of the main characters knew). After a time, Ted talks to Robin on the roof, and Robin is able to recognize his true feelings: he wants them to ""fall in love, get married, have kids and drive them to soccer practice"". Those are good feelings, she says, but he's looking at the wrong girl; and even though she doesn't want to get married at the moment, she doesn't want to break his heart either and he can't just stop feeling what he feels. In an attempt to prove to her that he doesn't necessarily have the feelings, he kisses her, but he realizes he does have those feelings and can't take them away. Robin suggests that they can be friends. Ted isn't sure because he's worried things might become awkward between them, but he comes around and takes Robin to formally meet his friends.

They go for a drink with the gang, where Robin fits perfectly in the group - by mocking Barney's jealousy and inability to get a date for the night while Carlos is making out with the random hook-up. Marshall announces he will drink two beers, go upstairs, write a 25-page paper, and get an 'A'; Future Ted tells his children that, in fact, Marshall got a B- on the paper, still impressive considering he wrote it all in one night.

While helping Ted get another round of drinks, Robin reminds Ted that he's a good catch and he'll make some girl very happy, and offers to help him find ""the one""."

Ted feels that McLaren's offers a middle of the road, guaranteed fun and it is safe. Barney says Ted is stuck in a rut. Promising Ted a ""legendary"" night (Ted feels Barney is too liberal with the word legendary), Barney pulls Ted into his cab and tells him that he needs to pick someone up at the airport. Only when they reach the baggage claim does Ted realize that Barney meant that he was going to JFK to pick up women.

Barney tells Ted that they are posing as international businessmen who have just returned from a lucrative trip from Japan. They hope to pick up women who have come to blow off steam in NYC for a weekend. Upon meeting two attractive women (Laura & one more) en route to Philadelphia, Barney impulsively purchases two tickets on the same flight for himself and Ted, and calls Marshall (Jason Segel) (who is busy studying) to tell him to join them. Barney asks Marshall to drive to Philly in his Fiero.

On the plane, however, Ted and Barney find out that the two girls have boyfriends who are players for the Philadelphia Eagles. Upon arrival, Ted and Barney are taken into custody by airport security, since they left luggage on a carousel in JFK (and then purchased a last minute flight to Philly, in cash), while video footage shows Barney doing the same thing on many occasions over the last many months. They are held for a while (Ted calls Marshall (who was on his way after Ted told him that the evening was a bust, since the girls were engaged) to come and meet them as their lawyer), but are released when Barney's luggage at JFK is revealed to contain only condoms and a PowerBar.

They then go with Sascha, an attractive airport guard, to what turns out to be a boring party. Barney, upon meeting someone who works security for the Liberty Bell, decides that it would be ""legendary"" to go lick the landmark. Ted initially declines, but after Barney tells Ted that he is his best friend, Ted reluctantly goes along. Later, back at McLaren's, Ted tells a girl about their adventure, and Future Ted confirms that it was indeed ""legendary."" Ted realized that with Barney he never got to where he wanted to go, but he always got a good story.

Meanwhile, Lily (Alyson Hannigan) and Robin (Cobie Smulders) go to the bar for a girls' night out. Lily becomes jealous of Robin because of the attention Robin receives from men at the bar. One after the other, guys hit on Robin and ignore Lily. They also buy her drinks. On the phone, Marshall reassures her that it is because she is wearing an engagement ring, and tells Lily that he would be fine if she removed it to get men's attention. Lily does so, but only succeeds insofar as a gay man approaches to tell her she sat on a grape. Robin sits in a booth alone, and happens to pick Lily's phone when Marshall calls. Marshall finds that Lily has been flirting with guys at the bar by removing her engagement ring. He turns back from Philly and goes back to NYC. Robin is annoyed by Lily's behavior, and convinces Lily that she has what most single women want: a good boyfriend. The gay man offers to help remove the grape stain, and Marshall walks in just as he is doing so. Marshall, who came only because he had second thoughts about Lily removing the ring, is reluctantly willing to fight the man, but is hugely relieved to learn that the man is gay. Just then, however, the man's boyfriend, also the jealous type, punches Marshall out."

He meets everyone else at the bar, and discovers that he likes bourbon, which he thought he hated. Realizing that his tastes have changed, he decides to reconsider girls he has previously dated but did not seem right at the time. The gang help him think back to some of the women he dated (Steph who did 175 adult films for a month as she was broke, Jackie who hit a hitchhiker while driving when she was 16 & kept on driving), and he fondly remembers the times he had with Natalie (Anne Dudek), with whom he broke up because he hadn't been looking for a serious relationship at the time. Unfortunately, she angrily hangs up the phone when he calls. Lily (Alyson Hannigan) asks Ted about why Natalie would be so upset with him, and he admits that he broke up with her on her birthday, and did so by leaving a message on her answering machine. Ted then visits Natalie's apartment, apologizing for his past behavior and offering a giant sock monkey toy as a belated birthday gift. Ted begs her to give him another chance, even just a cup of coffee. They soon end up in bed together.

Ted and Natalie start dating again, and after three weeks things appear to be going well. His friends like Natalie and agree she is the best girl he has dated in years. Abruptly, Ted says he has to break up with her, because he realizes she isn't ""the one"". The guys come up with cliches to help him break up with Natalie, but Lily tells Ted to tell her the truth. The next night Ted takes Natalie out to dinner to break up with her face to face. She tells him it is her birthday but there is no need for a present since he has already given her the best present: she ""can trust again"". When she says her mother can't wait to meet him, Ted cannot wait any longer and tells her he wants to break up. Natalie is furious and Ted's attempts to be honest only make her angrier. She demands a good explanation, and when Ted can't give her a satisfactory response, she uses what she learned in Krav Maga (a form of Israeli army developed guerrilla street fighting) class to beat Ted up. Ted returns to the bar in pain and with the shirt that started it all torn, and decides that there really is no good way to break up with someone. Future Ted tells his kids that as a result, all of his happy memories of Natalie were replaced with the memory of her beating him up. He later states that Natalie eventually found a better guy, got married a year later, and raised three children. However, Ted's son mocks him for being beaten up by a girl.

Barney dares Robin (Cobie Smulders) to say or do increasingly unprofessional things ($50 for saying the word ""booger"", $100 for saying ""nipple"") on the news for money. She refuses at first, but performs the dares as she feels insulted by the seemingly unimportant stories she's assigned to cover and realizes that no one, not even her boss, watches her show. He assigns her a story to cover a hot dog stand next to city hall and Robin says the word ""nipple"". For $200, she says ""I am a dirty dirt girl"" and spanks her ass, while covering the death of New York's oldest twins. Next she honks her own boobs for the 3rd dare. After three dares, Robin is challenged to do the ""Ickey Shuffle"" at her next news report for $1000. Barney has the bar turn on the television to Robin's news show and tells everyone to watch for something amazing. Robin plans to carry out the bet, but changes her mind at the last minute. While interviewing New York City's oldest Hansom cab driver she realizes her job is important to the people she is interviewing even if no one is watching. She stands up but accidentally slips and falls into a pile of horse droppings and curses on live television. Robin is embarrassed, especially when Ted reveals that he too saw the incident on the internet."

Ted (Josh Radnor) and Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agree to come, but Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) are hosting a wine-tasting party in an effort to be more mature with their other couple friends. At the club, Ted meets Robin's friend Kelly (Vanessa Lee Evigan), while Barney sets out to find a ""cutlet"" and grind with her all night. Barney had worn a shiny shirt as he believes that both girls and fishes are attracted to shiny objects

Marshall becomes very bored at the wine tasting party (talk of 30 yr mortgages, letting the wine rest & breathe for 30 mins for the tannins to mellow before drinking, pregnant women sonograms, fondue nights), and escapes by jumping out the bathroom window (according to him; Future Ted points out that their apartment was on the third floor). Meanwhile, Robin cannot get into the VIP area even though she was invited there by the owner who works out at the same gym as her and is a fan of her work at Metro News 1. She leaves to call the owner and lets Marshall into the club. However, Robin cannot get back in because a different bouncer is now at the door.

Meanwhile Ted cant speak to Kelly as the music is too loud. Ted prepares to leave after ruining his chances with Kelly (he yells ""I am wetting my pants"" just when the music volume goes down and Kelly hears her), but stays for a bit when Marshall arrives. They both get beers, but because Marshall had a temporary crown put in earlier that day (which comes out), it causes him extreme pain. He finds Barney, who suggests going to the bathroom to find some aspirin. Future Ted says that he is not sure what happened in the bathroom, but when Marshall comes out he is miraculously no longer in pain and hyper alert. Ted goes to the coat check area and ends up hanging out with the coat check girl. They bond over their mutual frustration with places that are supposed to be fun but end up not being fun, and decide to go on a date to the DMV and then getting their teeth cleaned at the dentist.

Meanwhile, Lily comes to the club, having also escaped from their party in (allegedly) the same manner as Marshall after she called him and heard the music of the club. Robin tells Lily that she doesn't have to rush to maturity, and Lily convinces Robin to flash their breasts at the bouncer to get back into the club.

Inside, Barney has discovered that the ""cutlet"" he has been grinding with all night is actually his cousin Leslie. Lily finds Marshall dominating the dance floor, and with a laugh forgives him for bailing on their party. In the cab on the way back, Marshall tells Ted that he was hurt that they didn't invite him to the club, while Ted replies that the only reason he went is to try to find a girl so he can have what Lily and Marshall have.

At the bar, Lily and Marshall are excited that their Halloween costumes came in the mail. Barney mentions that he loves Halloween because women dress up in ""provocative"" costumes (its one night of the year when women let out their inner adventurous self), such as a provocative witch, a provocative cat, and a provocative nurse. Robin then informs the group that she has been dating a guy named Mike for a few weeks, who the gang hasn't met yet. Lily suggests that they go on a double date.

Ted arrives at the bar and tells Robin that he will be waiting for the ""Pumpkin"", which he does every year on Halloween. Ted tells the story of how he met the Pumpkin four years earlier on Halloween night. He was at a party on the roof of his apartment building, where he met a girl who was wearing a sexy pumpkin costume, and made a drink she called a Tootsie Roll, which was a mixture of Kahlua and root beer. She is a marine biologist and studied penguins in Antarctica for a year. As Ted tells his story, Barney, Lily and Marshall continually interject, since Ted has evidently told this story many times. Ted continues, saying that he got the Pumpkin's phone number, but it was written on a Kit Kat wrapper, which Lily had unintentionally given away, causing Ted to lose her number.

At the apartment, Lily and Marshall show off their Halloween costumes: Lily is a parrot and Marshall is dressed as a Jack Sparrow pirate; they are certain they will win the costume contest at the bar (They paid $100 each for their costume and the prize is a $50 voucher at the bar). Ted presents his costume, a hanging Chad, which is what Ted wears every Halloween since it is what he wore when he met the Pumpkin. Barney then arrives at the apartment, dressed as a fighter pilot straight out of Top Gun. He tells Ted to join him at a Victoria's Secret Halloween party, but Ted insists he will go to the party on the roof to wait for the Pumpkin. Robin arrives next but isn't wearing a costume. She tells Lily she and Mike had talked about wearing costumes, but they decided not to dress up. Just then, Mike enters the apartment dressed as Hansel. Robin admits that she was just joking about dressing up as Hansel and Gretel. Barney follows Ted up to the party on the roof, noting that there are only six women there. As a Capella group begins singing, Barney starts drinking.

Lily, Marshall, Robin, and Mike are all eating at the bar. While Lily and Marshall enthusiastically share their food with each other, Robin does not want to share with Mike. Back at the roof party, Barney hits on a girl wearing a hula costume, but his crass pickup line (what does a fella have to do to get ""leid"" around here) fails.

In the women's bathroom, Lily asks Robin if she likes Mike. Robin insists that she just doesn't like couple-y stuff, but Lily tells her that it's the greatest thing in the world to be a part of. Lily tells Robin that she could lose Mike if she doesn't start acting differently, so she suggests that Robin share her dessert with Mike. Robin agrees.

After striking out with the hottest girl at the party, Barney changes his costume, now wearing a red devil costume, with hopes that he can make a ""second first impression."" Barney hits on the hula girl again, but he once again fails. Barney tells Ted that the Pumpkin is clearly not coming, so they must go to the Victoria's Secret party. Ted tells him that the Pumpkin represents hope for him.

Robin tries to share her sundae with Mike, but it immediately becomes obvious that she cannot, which leads to her finishing off the sundae herself. Mike decides to leave the bar, saying that he doesn't get the impression that Robin enjoys being with him. Robin denies this, but Mike says she much rather prefers being alone, not wanting to engage in any couple-y activities. Mike then breaks up with Robin.

Ted sees someone dressed as a penguin, who mixes Kahlua and root beer, and wonders if this person is the Pumpkin. His hopes are quickly dashed however when it is revealed that it is Barney in the costume. Barney also reveals that he used this new costume to get the hula girl's phone number, but she realizes that he was the same guy from before, upset that he tricked her into giving him her number.

Robin is not very upset that Mike broke up with her, saying that he wanted to be a ""we"" while Robin wanted to be an ""I."" Carl then announces the winners of the costume contest: Lily as a parrot and Marshall as a gay pirate.

Robin then finds Ted still on the roof. She tells him about being dumped by Mike, and wonders if there's something wrong with her, that she's a cold person who cannot be head-over-heels for someone. Ted tells her that she just hasn't met the right person yet. Ted and Robin sit together under a blanket."

Ellen Pierce (Camryn Manheim), the woman in charge of the matchmaking service, sees immediately that Barney is only seeking a one-night stand with a desperate woman (the alias he wrote on the registration form, ""Jack Package,"" gives him away), but promises she ""can work with"" Ted.

Ted is skeptical, but Ellen calculates that out of all the women in New York City, there are only eight whom Ted can date (9 Million people in NYC, 4.5 Million women, 482000 of women within 5 yrs of Ted's age, 48% of those are already in a relationship, half of them are not intelligent enough and so on, remove the ex-girlfriends, relatives and lesbians and that leaves us with 8 women precisely); facing this daunting statistic, Ted readily agrees to try it. Ellen promises success within three days, but after five days and no results, Ted wants to go back to find out what the problem is. Everyone tells him not to ""Ted out"" about it (explaining that Ted's name is also a verb, which means to over-think).

Still, he returns to Love Solutions, only to find Ellen, alone and despondent, telling him he is not matchable. She says that a good match needs a compatibility of 7.0 or higher.

He blurts out that they are a 9.6, and she tells him to not believe in matchmaking statistics. She says that when you fall in love a 8.5 is equal to a perfect 10. Ted returns to Love Solutions, and finds that Ellen has become distraught over believing to have failed in finding Ted's perfect match. However, Ted still has hope he will find ""the one"", and she can help him keep searching, no matter how long it takes.

Meanwhile, Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) discover an unusual creature in the apartment. When they first see it, Lily thinks it is a cockroach, while Marshall thinks it is a mouse. Either way, it scares them so bad they run to the bar and Lily drinks heavily to forget. When they spot it again they try to kill it with bug spray and a phone book, but when the phone book starts moving, they run off again.

Having gotten a better look, they now describe the creature as having six legs, antennae, and an exoskeleton, but also has tufts of fur, whiskers, and a tail, and roughly the size of a potato. Marshall and Lily call it the ""cockamouse."" Robin is skeptical of them (she says that they saw something totally normal, but have built it up in their heads like the Loch Ness monster.. Marshall totally believes in Nessy), but eventually they catch it, and Marshall takes it to the Columbia University Biology department, but discovers it has escaped and is still at the apartment. Robin finally sees the creature and throws a drink at it, as the only way she can think of subduing it is by trying to get it drunk. Marshall arrives and throws it out the window, and to their surprise the ""cockamouse"" flies away."

They are told by the hostess (who recognizes Lily from the photos she left) that the landlady died, and Lily didn't have a written lease. The building had sent her a notice 3 months ago, but Lily never got her mail.

Lily and Robin immediately head over to Ted (Josh Radnor) and Marshall's (Jason Segel) apartment to explain the situation, and Ted tells Lily that she is welcome to live with them, since she practically already does. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) warns Ted that things will change with Lily officially living at the apartment, and that eventually they will force Ted out. Since Ted and Marshall have not discussed who gets the apartment once Marshall and Lily get married. Barney insists that little things will be changing and eventually Ted will be edged out.

Ted does not believe him, but after he finds ""Shocky"" (his very old coffee pot that always gave him an electrical jolt) in the garbage and replaced by Lily's coffee pot (Ted's pot used to make rusty coffee and would also shock people), he begins to think Barney is right. He feels even more threatened when Marshall tells him he wants to hang Lily's painting where the two swords hang. In order to try to reclaim his territory, Ted begins to label all of his food and then orders a life-sized English phone booth for the apartment. He begins to argue with Marshall about who should get the apartment (Marshall didn't even want to move there since the WW era building would have been bad for his allergies, They don't need the 2 rooms as Marshall would never start a family while still in law school, Marshall took down the swords to make space for Lily's painting), which leads to a duel with the swords that hung on the wall. Events become tragic when a coffee table collapses under Marshall's weight, and he stumbles backward and runs Lily through the shoulder. After she is patched up at the hospital, Lily tells them that she does not want to live there once she and Marshall are married because it is a ""guy's apartment.""

After having to use a fake hospital emergency to bail out on a dud date, Barney has hit upon a revolutionary idea in the dating world: The Lemon Law. Similar in nature to lemon laws for used cars, Barney's new lemon law for dating gives a person five minutes to decide if the date will go on for the rest of the night or not. They can call the date off for any reason in the first five minutes, avoiding bad dates. Robin argues that it takes longer for people to get to know each other, so Barney challenges her by setting her up with a nerdy guy obsessed with Star Trek. When she is on the date, Barney calls her to try to get her to use the lemon law, but she refuses. The guy assumes it was a fake call, and she tells him that she would never do that. Only a few minutes later, she gets a real call from the hospital telling her that Marshall has accidentally stabbed Lily, and leaves. At the hospital Barney reveals that his lemon law is now ""a thing,"" as he had just been ""lemon-lawed"" by a girl earlier that night. Once Lily is released from the hospital, they go eat Chinese dumplings at the restaurant in Lily's old apartment."

Tastes like a turkey dinner. Robin reveals she is Canadian and they celebrate thanksgiving in October. Barney's tradition is thanksgiving dinner at a strip club: the lusty leopard.

It's Thanksgiving time, and Marshall and Lily visit Marshall's family in St. Cloud, Minnesota (Brothers Marcus & Marvin, Mother Judy & Father. 2 sister-in-laws). Marshall plays a game of ""bask-ice-ball"" (a no-rules, brawling combination of basketball and ice hockey that the Eriksen family invented) with his father and elder brothers while Lily helps his sister-in-law and mother in the kitchen.

The talk turns to babies, and Mrs. Eriksen reveals that her first-born son was almost 15 pounds at birth (""The doctor thought he was twins!""); this frightens Lily, who is dwarfed not only by Marshall but his entire family (at 6'4"", Marshall is the shortest of his brothers), and she dreads the idea of trying to give birth to a baby that size. At that point, Lily was already 5 days late in her monthly cycle, so the thought of a giant baby Eriksen growing inside of her, terrified her.

At dinner, Lily sees a 3 month old baby of one of the brothers and the baby is already as big as a toddler. And the wife is already pregnant with the next. Lily gets into an argument with Marshall and the Eriksens when she reveals she isn't going to change her surname after the wedding and doesn't want to raise their kids in Minnesota. Increasingly worked up, she drives off to a convenience store, where she is arrested for public urination.

Marshall goes to the station, and finds out Lily was using a home pregnancy test. Lily tells him of her concerns about raising a family of ""mayonnaise-guzzling giants in Minnesota"", but Marshall, faced with the very real possibility of having a child, assures her that they are not going to settle down in Minnesota (as Bask-ice-ball is really dangerous), and alleviates Lily's fears. Finally, Marshall and Lily discover that Lily isn't pregnant; they return to the Eriksen home, much relieved, and the Thanksgiving dinner concludes amicably.

Meanwhile, Robin and Ted have no plans for Thanksgiving, and decide to help out at a soup kitchen. When they arrive, they are shocked to find Barney volunteering there already (he considers himself as the Angelina Joli of incredibly hot guys), and that he is highly regarded as one of the best volunteers on staff. The organizer, Kendall, tells Ted and Robin that they have enough volunteers, but after being vouched for by Barney, they are allowed to help. Soon after, they find out that not all the food received as donations to the soup kitchen is actually distributed to the needy; many volunteers take the better, more expensive donations for themselves.

Ted, seeing that this is selfish, begins to distribute rare food items to the needy. Ted, Robin, and Barney are kicked out, and Barney (who was volunteer of the year) becomes upset with Ted because he has to complete his remaining hours hauling trash; it turns out that Barney volunteered there as mandatory community service after being arrested for public urination on the judge's church.

To make it up to him, Ted and Robin agree to go to the strip club, The Lusty Leopard, with Barney, and Ted pays for a homeless man to get a lap dance, which he realizes is the one act of charity he performed on Thanksgiving. Another stripper named Tracy compliments Ted on his generosity, and Future Ted tells his kids ""And that's the story of how I met your mother"", shocking them before revealing, to their relief, that he is joking."

Barney convinces Ted to take five shots of 'Red Dragon' (a special blend by Carl the Bartender at McLaren's); Ted claims that he can still function cognitively even under the influence of the alcohol, but shortly afterwards he blacks out. He wakes up the next morning with a girl he doesn't remember beside him in bed, a pineapple on his nightstand, and a sprained ankle. He also finds out that his coat has been partially burnt.

Ted asks Marshall and Lily about the night, and Marshall and Lily tell him that he sang along with the jukebox in the bar while standing on a table. He also repeatedly drunk dialed Robin, who was on a date with a wealthy businessman. Ted claims that he has been vomit free since 1993. He sings to her over the phone with a song playing on the jukebox. He fell off the table (explaining the sprained ankle), and Marshall and Lily took him up to his bed. However, they are surprised when Ted asks about the girl on the bed and can shed no light on the pineapple or why Ted's coat is burnt. Ted calls Barney, thinking that he might know what had happened, and finds him sprawled in their bathtub still dressed in his suit.

Barney recounts that Ted reappeared at the bar around 1 a.m., but when he began to call Robin again, Barney lit Ted's coat on fire. After some more fun, he puts Ted back into bed, and similarly has no idea who the mystery girl is.

Ted finds that someone wrote on his arm, saying to call the number if Ted was found passed out somewhere. Ted calls the number and reaches the bartender, Carl, who fills in some more of the story: Ted again returned to the bar at 3:00 a.m., but Carl refused to serve him. Ted told Carl the meaning of the word ""karaoke"" (Japanese for empty orchestra, which Ted finds hauntingly beautiful) and that he wanted to go see some penguins at the zoo (that's when Carl writes his number on Ted's arm, in case his ends up in the sewers), then suddenly called someone (presumably Robin) and told her come over and do something ""crazy"". Based on this information, Marshall, Lily, and Barney believe that the mysterious girl in Ted's bed is actually Robin, but as Ted goes to wake her up, Robin calls and tells him she is coming over to discuss the previous night.

The girl in bed, Trudy (Danica McKellar), wakes up, and explains her side of the story: Ted had caught her eye during his drunken dancing, and they exchanged numbers in the ladies' room of the bar (which Ted used by mistake). She told Ted the meaning of the word ""karaoke"" and about her love for penguins, explaining why Ted later mentioned these things to Carl. It was she whom he later called and invited over, not Robin. Ted tells Trudy to hide when Robin comes over to talk, and Trudy leaves via the fire escape before Ted can show her to Robin to prove that he has moved on and that they are still only friends and this is not weird between them. Future Ted explains that Trudy never responded to his subsequent message, and he never did work out where the pineapple came from, but it was delicious."

Robin has plans with her rich boyfriend, Derek, but Ted, Lily, Marshall, and Barney plan to attend five parties in the three hours before midnight to find the best party to be at to begin the new year. With Ranjit as their limo driver and Barney's ""Get Psyched"" mix CD to psych them up, the group goes to the first party where they pick up Ted's coworker Marybeth (Kathleen Rose Perkins), who has been flirting with him at the office. Barney also finds a date, a woman with a Russian-like accent named Natalya. Lily complains that her shoes are hurting her feet, but Ted asks that she power through the pain and they head to party number two.

Disappointed with party number two, the gang heads to party number three, leaving Natalya behind because no one except Barney liked her. Robin calls Ted asking if they could pick her up because Derek had to work late and canceled their plans. Even though the extra stop jeopardizes the schedule, Ted cannot refuse to pick up Robin. Robin joins the group and her disappointment caused by her canceled date brings down the mood. Ted tries to lift Robin's spirits by saying that he will kiss her at midnight and suggests that they go to Gray's Papaya as Robin is feeling hungry and hasn't had anything to eat all evening. Lily returns to the apartment to change her shoes, intending to catch up with the group at party number three, while everyone else gets hot dogs. Lily tries to wish Marshall a happy new year in case she can't rejoin the group, but Marshall says that they will find each other.

The limo heads to party number three when Marshall sees Moby (J. P. Manoux) out the window of the parked limo. Ted asks Moby if he wants a ride to the party that he's going to and once inside the limo the group wrangles an invitation to Moby's party. Worried that Lily won't find them and unable to reach her on her cell phone, Marshall leaves the limo to find Lily. The group heads to Moby's party, but discovers that he is not Moby (nor 'Tony', but Eric) when he brandishes a gun and rants crazily. As they drop off Not Moby at his party, Marshall's cell phone, that he accidentally left in the limo, rings. Barney answers the call from Lily and tells her that Marshall is looking for her at party number three. Lily doesn't see Marshall but she does see Not Moby walking into the party. Ted tells her to leave the party quickly and when she rejoins the group they realize that Lily accidentally went to party number four, which coincidentally is Not Moby's party. The group heads to party number three to find Marshall. Barney realizes that Not Moby took his ""Get Psyched"" mix just as the limo gets a flat tire. While Ranjit fixes the tire, Barney laments the loss of his CD. To cheer up everyone, Ted and Robin begin singing the first song from the ""Get Psyched"" mix. Recognizing that Ted is in love with Robin, Marybeth decides to leave the group.

Still stuck with a flat tire and only 15 minutes until midnight, Ted suggests that the group begin walking so that they can get to party number three by 12:45 and celebrate the New Year in central time. As Lily tries to find Marshall by yelling his name, Barney tells Ted to stop trying so hard--he can't keep New Year's Eve from being what it is, the biggest letdown of the year. Just as Ted is about to give up, they hear Marshall yelling Lily's name. Marshall runs up to the limo and tells the group that when he couldn't find Lily at party number three he walked to party number four (Not Moby's party) where he heard Barney's mix CD playing and he swiped it, and got his shirt signed by ""not Moby"" as ""Eric"". Marshall then went to party number five, which was awesome, and says that they need to be at party number five at midnight. With eight minutes until midnight, everyone climbs in the limo--where they find Natalya who had been sleeping in the front seat--and they head to party number five.

With three minutes until midnight, the limo is stuck in traffic. Accepting that the group won't make it to party number five, Ted opens a bottle of champagne and pours everyone a glass, saying that they have a great party in the limo. Derek appears at the limo's window, having left his business meeting early to be with Robin at midnight. As the countdown to midnight begins with everyone in the limo paired off except for Ted, he leaves the limo. To Ted's surprise, Robin follows him, saying that she hadn't forgotten their deal to kiss each other at midnight, and they share a kiss."

But when Ted runs into Claudia two days before the wedding (she was yelling at her cake baker that she wanted Tahitian Vanilla, and he had got the order wrong) and mentions that he is bringing a date, Claudia tells him that he indicated on his RSVP card that he would be coming alone and angrily forbids him from bringing a date. Ted tries to tell Robin that he will not be able to take her to the wedding, but chickens out when he sees Robin in the dress that she bought for the occasion (she looked very very hot). Barney can't figure out why Claudia is marrying Stuart as she is way hotter than him.

When he tells Lily his problem, Lily, against Marshall's advice, suggests that Ted appeal to Stuart (she says its 40% his wedding too), who gives Ted permission without a second thought. Ted is excitedly anticipating his romantic evening with Robin, when Claudia calls to say that the wedding has been canceled. Apparently the issue of Ted's date led to a huge argument (Claudia claims that Stuart undermines her at every turn, Stuart claims that she likes to control everything her own way) and the couple broke up. Concerned about their friend and not wanting to disappoint Robin, who is really looking forward to the wedding, Marshall and Ted go to talk to Stuart and Lily goes to comfort Claudia at MacLaren's.

Stuart tells Ted and Marshall that he is glad the wedding is off, and that he missed being single. Ted tries to reassure Stuart that everyone has doubts about commitment, but those doubts should not keep him from getting married; Marshall, however, tells Stuart that he should not marry Claudia unless he is absolutely sure that he wants to. Ted is worried since he knows Claudia will demand $400,000 from him to pay for the wedding, if it does not take place. Meanwhile, at MacLaren's, Barney finds Claudia waiting for Lily and immediately tries to seduce her, offering fake sympathy and alcohol. Lily pulls Barney away from Claudia just as Stuart arrives with Ted and Marshall. Because of Marshall's words, Stuart apologizes to Claudia and they get back together. After a few more drinks, Claudia finally agrees to allow Ted to bring a date.

On the night of the wedding Ted arrives at Robin's apartment to pick her up, but just before they leave Robin receives a phone call from her producer offering her the opportunity to anchor the news that evening. Though disappointed, Ted tells her to go to work. Ted goes to the wedding alone and Claudia shows him his RSVP, on which he did indeed check the ""coming alone"" box. Thinking the mistake reveals that he really has given up on finding someone, Ted tells Barney that he is ready to just be single; suddenly he locks eyes with a pretty woman across the room.

Meanwhile, Marshall and Lily begin planning their wedding, but they disagree about what kind of ceremony to have. Lily wants an outdoor wedding (barefoot in the woods, next to a lake) while Marshall wants an indoor wedding with a band. But at Claudia and Stuart's wedding, they finally agree on something: crab puffs."

The next morning at the apartment, he tells Marshall and Lily that he had the most amazing night of his life, and begins to tell the story.

Ted approaches the pretty woman, who warns him that she never hooks up with people at weddings. Ted wins her over with some flirting, so she suggests a compromise: they will spend the rest of the wedding together, enjoying a perfect evening, and then never see each other again, so that the future will never ruin it. They plan to use fake names - she says her name is Buttercup and Ted gives his as Lando Calrissian - but Barney immediately comes by the table and calls Ted by his name several times. They agree to tell each other only their first names (her name is Victoria (Ashley Williams)) and not exchange any contact information. Lily and Marshall interrupt the story to tell Ted what a stupid idea that is, but Ted defends his decision, saying that they had a great time and because he will never see Victoria again the memory won't be ruined.

Returning to his story of the previous night, Ted steals a bottle of champagne and Victoria steals the bouquet, and they head to a ballroom in the hotel. After Victoria dances to Ted's piano accompaniment, the two almost kiss. Victoria says that they shouldn't kiss that night, that a bad kiss would ruin the romance of the evening. Instead they hover just shy of a kiss because the exciting part is the moment leading up to it (its the drum-roll of the kiss). Marshall interrupts the story again and he and Lily reiterate that Ted is an idiot for not getting her number. While Ted initially defends the romance of their night together, he soon snaps and realizes that he will not rest until he sees Victoria again.

He calls Claudia to ask if she knows Victoria's last name, but Claudia tells him that there wasn't a guest named Victoria at the wedding. Lily thinks the girl used a 2nd fake name and Marshall thinks she is a ghost. Remembering that Victoria was sitting at the table with the bridesmaids, Ted calls Barney to ask if he would call the bridesmaid he hooked up with to see if she knows Victoria. After Ted promises to go to Foxy Boxing with Barney, he calls the bridesmaid, but she doesn't know who Victoria is. Thinking that he won't be able to find Victoria, Ted accepts the situation as fate.

Robin comes over to Ted, Lily, and Marshall's apartment and tells Lily that after anchoring the news the previous night she has been made the new substitute weekend anchor. Lily tells Robin the story of Ted's romantic evening and Robin says that she knows who Victoria is. Lily asks how Robin could know Victoria when she wasn't at the wedding, and Robin tells her that she came late to the reception to surprise Ted, but she saw Ted and Victoria almost kissing, and went into the ladies' room to cry. Robin says that she isn't sure why she was crying, and Lily tells her that obviously she cried because she has feelings for Ted. Robin finally admits that she does like Ted, but she doesn't think her feelings change anything because she doesn't want to get married and Ted does.

Returning to the previous night, Robin says that Victoria heard her crying and tried to comfort her, and told her she was the caterer. Robin says that she should find Ted and tell him who Victoria is so that he can be happy, but Lily suggests that Robin could tell him that she has feelings for him, which will also make him happy. Robin leaves the apartment unsure of what to do.

At MacLaren's, Ted, Marshall and Barney are having drinks when Robin arrives. She pulls Ted aside to talk to him when he gets a phone call from Claudia. She apologizes for snapping at him when he called to ask about Victoria. At Marshall's insistence, Ted asks Claudia where she got the cake for her wedding, and she tells him that a local bakery called The Buttercup Bakery. Remembering that Victoria gave Buttercup as her fake name, Ted realizes that she wasn't on the guest list because Victoria made the cake. Ted wants to go find Victoria, but Lily tries to stall him. When Lily asks Robin to back her up, Robin tells Ted to go ahead. Ted then remembers the end of his evening with Victoria. They return to the empty ballroom for one last dance. Ted tells Victoria that there is a flaw to their plan: while this night will be a great memory, it will be overshadowed by one bad memory, the memory of Victoria leaving and Ted never seeing her again. Victoria tells Ted to close his eyes and count to five, and when he does so, she's gone.

Sitting outside her bakery in a taxi cab, Ted wonders if he really should go inside to meet her. He wonders if this perfect memory is something that both he and Victoria needed in their lives. As he ponders this for way too long, Barney tells him to make a decision already. Ted goes inside, where he sees Victoria. She exclaims ""thank god"" and the two share a passionate kiss."

He then adds that it was mostly Victoria's idea, and the only reason he's going along with it is that he thinks Victoria might be the one. Ted begins to get anxious after a few weeks and can't stand it. However, Victoria decides to speed things up when she realizes that she will be out of town when their first month together ends. They go back to Ted's (supposedly) deserted apartment, and spend a lot of time just being together before they actually go to the bedroom to have sex together for the first time.

Marshall and Lily are celebrating their nine year anniversary, and plan to go to a fancy bed and breakfast (NY magazines top five romantic getaways on a budget), which is four hours away, and has strict guidelines, such as breakfast at 7 am. Marshall also mentions that it is going to rain. As they are about to leave for the trip, Lily and Marshall decide to bail and just stay home. Ted and Victoria unexpectedly show up, trapping them in the bathroom. Marshall says if they come out now, their sex night will be ruined and one of them would have to have sex with Ted. They first make fun of Ted and Victoria for being a mushy new couple, but Lily begins to wonder what happened to the romance in their relationship. She and Marshall try just staring into each other's eyes, but Lily ruins it when she asks about dry cleaning. They then try just holding hands, but Marshall ruins it by sneaking an arm around Lily and caressing her breast. As they begin to wonder if they're out of ""firsts"", Lily realizes that she has to pee. She hasn't peed in front of Marshall before, and always wanted to keep some of the secret protected, but eventually does pee in front of Marshall. Although not happy at first, she realizes that this was a first for her and Marshall, and then realizes that their relationship is not stale.

Meanwhile, Robin has been left alone and is hanging out with her friend who was once again dumped. She sees Barney at MacLaren's, and, once her friend starts making out with a random guy, she decides she will be Barney's ""bro"" for the evening. She helps Barney build on his blind approach, by suggesting that he can check out a girl's reflection in the mirror on the bar. Robin shows up in a suit, and Barney is impressed. After hanging out at the cigar bar (she orders a Johnnie Walker Blue Neat and a Montecristo # 2), they go play laser tag. They go back to the bar, where Robin tries to hook Barney up with a woman and Barney tries to hook Robin up with a lesbian. The two decide to leave to go play Battleship.

Back at Robin's apartment, Barney mistook her invitation to play Battleship as an invitation to have sex. Barney says that he got Ted's blessing to hook up with her, revealing that the phone call that Ted had received earlier was from Barney, who asked if he would be cool with him hooking up with Robin, which Ted was mostly dismissive of. Robin is disappointed that Ted didn't seem bothered by this, and Barney realizes that she likes Ted.

The two begin playing Battleship, and Robin asks Barney not to tell Ted. After yelling at Barney, Robin admits that she has feelings for Ted, and Barney promises not to tell, on the condition that she not mention Barney's going ""bare pickle"" in front of her"

Lily gives it to him and he violently destroys it, but Lily reveals that she gave him a tape of Ted's graduation and hid the real one.

Barney meets all of them at the bar later, stating that that tape was the most embarrassing thing that happened to him. While the others want to know how it happened, Barney goads Marshall to confess an embarrassing moment. Marshall confesses that he was seen half-naked by Lily's kindergarten class after using a shared toilet in the school during which walked in on by another student from a different class. This leads Barney to tell the story that led to the creation of the tape: in 1998, when he was 23, he was a hemp-wearing, peace loving hippie who worked in a coffee shop with his girlfriend Shannon. ""Saving themselves"" for marriage, they had planned on going to Nicaragua with the Peace Corps, until Shannon failed to meet him on the night they were supposed to leave. He stops at this point, so to encourage him, Lily gets someone else to tell their most embarrassing story as well to take the pressure off of Barney. Marshall spins a game wheel he brought and it lands on Robin. She attempts to tell the story of the time she fell in horse poop on the news - but everyone else has already seen it. However, volunteering in her place, Victoria begins to tell a story involving a game of Truth or Dare, a squeeze bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping, and the hot tub at her grandparent's retirement community, but Future Ted does not recount it, stating that it is ""too inappropriate"".

Back to Barney's narrative: Shannon revealed to Barney that she backed out, saying that her father did not want her to go, because he has supported her and wants her to stay home. Barney left, but then went back to confront her dad, when she saw Shannon kissing an older man, which he presumed to be her father. To continue into the narrative, Lily tells the story of how Marshall's mother once overheard the couple having sex via a phone call.

Barney then tells that he confronted Shannon and found out that she had begun seeing a yuppie alpha male named Greg, who got her out of her hippie ""phase"" and bought her stuff. She told him to go and forget about her. Barney postponed his departure instead and made the video and sent it to Shannon, but was humiliated when she and Greg returned and mocked him, and left the coffee shop devastated. Barney then changed his appearance and lifestyle, getting a haircut, wearing suits, and discarding his idealistic world-view.

Finally, he goads Ted to tell his embarrassing story. Although Ted tries to speak of a summer trip to hide it, he relents and tells Victoria that he and Robin had dated at one point - and that on the night he told Robin he loved her he ""re-returned"" to her apartment to try and kiss her, but was so drunk that he threw up on her doormat and ran away instead. Although that does create some tension between Ted and Victoria, Barney deems it enough to finish his story: after he left Ted and Marshall's apartment with the tape, he visited Shannon, and found out that she has a son. He breaks down in tears, and Lily attempts to comfort him by assuring him that his own life isn't bad compared to Shannon's; Barney looks up, amused by Lily's words, and declares that his life ""rocks"" because he has money, suits, lots of one-night stands without a ""brat"" to take care of. He then brags that he finally had sex with Shannon, showing them all the video he took with his cell phone, and leaves, happy with the dirt he has acquired on all of them.

The episode closes with a montage which showcases happier moments coming out of the secrets between Marshall and Lily and Ted and Victoria. Next Barney is seen in the bar appearing jealous of a nearby couple, suggesting his words were really just a front to hide the fact that he might want a meaningful relationship someday, and finally Robin smiling at a new gift-wrapped Scherbatsky doormat. Over that shot, Future Ted hints that he would eventually come to learn of Robin's feelings for him, but that's another story."

Both are unsure, but have always believed that long distance relationships never work; according to Ted, it's a lie teenagers use to get laid the summer before college, while Marshall and Lily say that they are all talk and no sex.

Marshall needs a new suit (his old suit has holes in it) for an important interview for an internship position at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Barney tells him that he will take Marshall to his tailor and get a discount for it (at 1/3rd the cost), and outfits Marshall with a very nice suit. Ted accompanies them and continues to agonize over his problem with Victoria. Marshall argues that Ted needs to fight for Victoria, but Barney argues that he knows nothing about her (her favorite color, whether she likes cats or dogs, is she open to a three-way etc) Barney tells Marshall not to waste the suit on NRDC, and come work at his office instead.

Meanwhile, Victoria and Robin take Lily shopping for a wedding dress (she knows a lot of bridal shops due to her wedding cake business), but cannot find anything she likes in her price range. Robin gets tipsy on free champagne and tries to manipulate Victoria into going to Germany, since Robin wants to break them up so she can make a move on Ted, but eventually accepts that Victoria and Ted are really in love, when she sees that Victoria is really sincere about Ted and values him over everything else.

In helping Ted and Victoria make their decisions, Marshall and Lily tell two versions of the same story: During college, Lily took a summer art class in Paris. According to Marshall, Lily met this strange man named Gabriel; Marshall thought he was moving in on Lily, so when he visited her he told Gabriel to stay away from Lily. According to Lily, she was good friends with a homely girl who was self-conscious about her mustache named Gabrielle, who suddenly stopped talking to Lily about halfway through the summer, leaving Lily friendless. Neither of them knows the other's story.

Just for fun, Victoria gets one of the nice dresses from the front window, which Lily loves; she cannot afford it, but accidentally sits down in the free cake provided by the bridal shop, and then rips the dress. Later at the bar, Marshall gets the bill for the suit from Barney and finds out that he must pay $4,000 for it, even though Barney promised him a great deal, and realizes it must be a ruse by Barney to get him to accept a high-paying job at Barney's firm, something which Barney attempts to deny. He turns to Lily and says he'll do whatever it takes to pay it off, at which point Lily breaks down and reveals that she ruined, and thus had to purchase, an $8,000 dress; Marshall, his back to the wall and with no other option to pay $12,000 plus the money for the wedding, decides to go work for Barney.

Ted and Victoria meet for dinner having made their respective decisions: Ted thinks she should go, while Victoria thinks she should stay. However, they both impulsively change their minds after Victoria hands Ted a cupcake. They argue a bit and decide to break up. However, Marshall tells Ted to spend one more awesome day with Victoria. The two decide to spend the day enjoying New York doing all the things they'd wanted to during the relationship, and Future Ted tells his kids that's exactly what they did (but it's unclear if they did or if Future Ted is able to remember any of that stuff, since actually only scenes are shown of them in bed). At the airport, Ted and Victoria decide to give long distance a try, both saying that it will work; however, Future Ted tells his kids that it didn't, that long-distance relationships never work."

Jessica Alba is at the front door in a trench coat and nothing else. Jessica Simpson is at the back door. What do you do, go). Barney refuses to say what his job is and just says ""Please"".

At the end of his first day, Marshall is ready to quit, but Barney manipulates him into staying. Barney convinces Marshall that he would be happier knowing that he could provide a better life for Lily with a bigger income. Marshall asks Barney for advice on how to deal with his coworkers, and Barney suggests behaving more like his coworkers and blending. When Marshall tells Lily about his plan, Lily doesn't think that it's a good idea, but Marshall thinks that he can keep his work persona separate from his real personality. Barney shows Marshall how to act like the guys at work and Marshall gains their acceptance. He tells fake stories about his encounter with strippers and hookers to get popular. Marshall's work persona begins to bleed over into his home life to Lily's displeasure. Marshall asks Lily to give his work friends a chance and they go out to a karaoke bar. Lily is not having a good time and when Marshall accepts a permanent job offer at Barney's company Lily leaves the table. Lily asks Marshall when he decided to give up his values. He says that he hasn't abandoned his values but he wants to make good money for a couple of years so that he can give Lily a better life. Lily tells him that he can give her a great life with what he has already (She says Marshall already had a huge ""Package"", while he was referring to the car, the house etc that he could afford with the salary). The two make up by performing their favorite karaoke song on stage.

Meanwhile, Ted struggles with his long distance relationship with Victoria. He feels guilty that Victoria has sent him three care packages and he hasn't sent her any. When he calls to thank her for the most recent care package, he impulsively says that he sent her a care package a few days ago.

Ted asks Robin for advice about how to cover up his lie. Robin suggests that he assemble a care package with New York-themed things and top off the package with a New York Times from three days ago. When Victoria calls Ted to thank him for the care package, he accidentally falls asleep on the phone. Feeling guilty and frustrated, Ted plans to fly to Germany to visit Victoria. But when he is buying his ticket, Victoria sends him an email telling him that they need to talk that evening. Ted worries that Victoria is going to break up with him, but Robin reassures him that he is worried for no reason. The phone call from Victoria is four hours late. Future Ted ends the episode by using Bilson's game, and says 'Here's the real question: It's 2 a.m., your friends are still out singing karaoke, but you're home early because you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany who was supposed to call 4 hours ago. And then... the phone rings.' Ted answers it, and Robin asks if he wants to come over. Future Ted then asks 'What do you do? Go.'"

Earlier in the day, Robin spoke at Lily's kindergarten class about her career. One of the children asked her about her romantic life and Robin felt threatened when she had to answer that she doesn't have a boyfriend. Then Barney wows the kids with his fire magic. That evening Robin's coworker, Sandy Rivers (Alexis Denisof), told her that they should have sex, making it clear that he has no interest in pursuing a relationship with her. She came home, drank a very large glass of wine, and finally called Ted. Ted asks why, and she replies that she just set up a new juicer and she knows Ted likes juice.

When she calls, Ted is awaiting a phone call from Victoria, who told him they needed to talk. Victoria didn't call when expected and Ted believes it to be an inevitable break-up call, so he agrees to come over, even though he knows that Robin might be asking for more than just a friend. He tries to rationalize the situation on his way to Robin's apartment and he has conversations with his subconscious, which appears as Victoria. He tells Victoria that nothing will happen, but Victoria doesn't believe him. Ted calls Marshall for a second opinion, and Marshall tries to convince him not to go, reminding him of what his mother says. When Marshall's attempts to dissuade Ted do not work, Lily takes the phone and tells Ted that he can't go to Robin's, something will happen because Robin has feelings for Ted. Ted is stunned that Robin likes him and tells Lily that he won't go to Robin's apartment. Lily hangs up the phone thinking that she convinced Ted, but Marshall and Barney both know that Lily just helped convince Ted to go to Robin's. Ted arrives at Robin's and they make awkward small talk about their shared model of cell phone. When Robin asks how his conversation with Victoria went, Ted lies and says that they broke up.

At the karaoke bar, Lily urges Marshall to go home, but Barney decides to prove to Lily and Marshall that good things can happen after 2 a.m. Barney invites a Korean Elvis impersonator to come with the group to MacLaren's. Marshall calls Ted to invite him, and Ted admits to Marshall that he is at Robin's and just lied about breaking up with Victoria. Marshall and Lily convince Ted that he needs to leave before he starts a relationship with Robin while still involved with Victoria. Ted tries to leave, but as he and Robin say good-bye they kiss.

Ted and Robin make out on the couch and Robin asks if they should move into the bedroom. Ted excuses himself and goes to the bathroom to call Victoria. His imaginary Victoria appears and asks him if he really thinks it's a good idea to break up with his girlfriend with the woman who he is about to have sex with in the next room.

While Ted wrestles with his conscience, Marshall and Lily try to head home from MacLaren's, but Barney again pleads with them to stay because they have not done something legendary yet. Korean Elvis also tries to convince them to stay, whispering something into Lily's ear, which causes her to knee him in the groin. After a few seconds of silence, Barney then proclaims that the night has become legendary by asking ""Hey you guys, remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the private parts?"".

Back in Robin's bathroom, Ted acknowledges to Victoria that he owes her a real break-up call. But when Victoria asks if Ted is going to go home, he asks if it will really matter if he sleeps with Robin the night before he breaks up with Victoria. He is tired of pretending that he isn't in love with Robin, and he admits that he just wants to get laid. Just as he has convinced himself that sleeping with Robin is OK, Ted realizes that he has Robin's phone. When he emerges from the bathroom, Robin is hanging up his phone (having answered thinking it was hers), having just finished talking with Victoria. Furious that Ted lied to her and was willing to sleep with her while involved with someone else, Robin gives him his phone telling him to call her back.

As Ted heads back to his apartment, he finally calls Victoria and the two break up. Future Ted reminds his kids that nothing good happens after 2 a.m., and says that lying to Robin was the stupidest thing he ever did. Finally, Ted gets home and does what he should have done at the start of the evening... goes to bed, although it's clear neither he nor Robin will be getting any sleep."

Since she notified everyone three months in advance, Ted told her he would be bringing Victoria as he is dating her at the time. Right before the awards banquet, Ted ended his relationship with Victoria and ruined his chances with Robin at the same time, and is wondering if he should still bring a date. Barney suggests getting Ted a prostitute as a date (someone hotter and with bigger boobs than Robin to make her jealous), which Ted immediately dismisses. Barney claims that prostitution is the world's oldest profession and the growth industry of the 21st century. 1/8 of all adult women in America are prostitutes. Plus, Ted had gone 57 days without sex. Barney shows up a bit later with a stunning blonde-haired woman named Mary for Ted (who lives in Barney's building), and Ted again refuses until he finds that Robin is also bringing a date for the banquet: Sandy Rivers, the guy who reads the newspaper on the news show every morning and requests that he always be referred to by his full name. Ted then agrees, and Mary is his date for the evening. Barney assures him that only he and Marshall will ever know that Mary is an escort. Barney claims to have paid Mary $500 for the night.

At the banquet (hosted by Vampire Lou), Ted finds himself more and more attracted to Mary (he even calls her hot to her face and flirts with her), who claims to be a paralegal at a law firm downtown. Lily is tired through the evening as she teaches kindergarten and the school took away nap time.. Lily used to sleep along with the kids during nap time, which was unsafe and illegal. Ted tries to talk to Robin to restore their friendship, but fails (he says she doesn't even return his calls and is waving Edward R Moron in his face.. Robin retorts that para-legally blonde is also there to make her jealous in her low cut dress). Robin wins the award, and thanks all of her friends for coming and supporting her, except Ted.

Meanwhile, Barney has got Ted a room in the hotel for the night (he claims that men with at least 1 encounter with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in their future relationships), and Ted is beginning to think about whether he and Mary should actually go up to the room. Marshall tries to stop him, but without success. Ted and Mary head up to the room, while Robin and Sandy Rivers get a cab. Shortly afterward, Robin returns, reiterating that she does not date co-workers, and she brought Sandy Rivers only to make Ted jealous, and Marshall tells her that Ted brought Mary to make Robin jealous. Marshall then (in an oddly telepathic manner) tells Lily that Mary is a prostitute, and Lily, who is asleep, wakes up and asks if Mary is indeed an escort. After a minute, Barney reveals that Mary is not really a prostitute, but actually a paralegal that lives in his building. She has no idea that Ted thinks she is a prostitute. Ted does not know this (Mary says her clients rode her all day along, and one guy in particular wont leave her alone: talk about anal), and Mary eventually slaps him and leaves when Ted insists that she's a prostitute (& refuses to go into the hotel room with her).

At the bar, Barney insists to Ted that the reason he got on so well with Mary was because he thought he was on to a sure thing anyway, but Ted reveals that he's had the last laugh by never checking out of the hotel room, and leaves to increase the already hefty bill on Barney's credit card."

They hurriedly book the available date (cos their rivals Todd and Valerie who have their wedding on the same date and have similar tastes to Lily and Marshall, are on their way to book it as well.. they get it after trapping Todd and Valerie in the elevator and press all its buttons, while taking the stairs themselves), leaving only two months until the wedding. Lily becomes very stressed due to the shortened time frame and obsesses over the details, becoming somewhat of a monster bride. Robin is in charge of flowers, Ted on invitations. Barney is asked not to sleep with anyone remotely related to Lily.

Marshall finds a possible band for the wedding, The 88, but Lily will not approve the booking until she hears them play ""their"" song (""Good Feeling"" by Violent Femmes). They are only holding the date till the coming Monday. The only way Lily can hear them is if she sneaks into a high school prom where they are playing the coming weekend. Lily thus decides to sneak in with Robin and Barney. Robin is excited, because she never had the chance to attend her prom in high school, having been too busy with field hockey tournaments in the spring. The girls put on classy cocktail dresses, but Barney tells him to dress like teenagers (you go ho or you go home).. Lily finds her actual prom dress that she attended in 1996 with her date Scooter (David Burtka) When they arrive, they find tight security (who tell her that only students or dates of students are allowed inside), so Lily and Robin offer to be the dates of two nerdy high school seniors, while Barney decides to find another way in.

Meanwhile, Ted and Marshall are stuffing 200 wedding invitations on their ""Guys' Night Out"" until Robin calls Marshall and asks him to bring the sheet music of ""Good Feeling"" to Lily. The band agreed to play Lily's song if she can get them the sheet music. Lily remembers her senior prom and all she had thought she'd experience but never did. She begins to have doubts about getting married, since she never achieved many of her goals in life (She wants to travel, live overseas as an artist, and have a lesbian relationship). She tells this to Robin (her date pukes on her shoes while dancing with her), who convinces her that she is marrying her best friend in the world, and that she could possibly be an artist and live an artist's lifestyle later in life (Lily wanted to be a painter all her life and didn't mind even working as a waitress in crappy cafes to pay for her dream). She then kisses her on the lips, giving Lily the ""lesbian experience"" she never had.

Ted and Marshall sneak in the back, and find Barney dressed as a turtle mascot. Marshall asks the senior who Lily's date is for the night where she is, then pulls out a pair of Nunchaku and hits Marshall with them. Ted then tackles the senior to show Marshall that he will always have his back in a fight. The two seniors, Marshall, Ted, and Barney are taken outside for trespassing, but Marshall and Ted sneak back in when Barney grabs the head of the turtle mascot suit and runs off (security has to chase Barney and thus leaving the entry unattended). Marshall and Lily dance together, and agree to have The 88 play at the wedding, while Ted dances with Robin, who now wants to try restoring their friendship."

Barney and Clarke do increasingly gross things to each other & now Barney has pulled Marshall in to help him out in his feud with Clarke. Barney gives Marshall the title of ""Executive mischief consultant"".

Meanwhile, it's Ted's twenty-eighth birthday. Barney's present to Ted is the ""greatest pick up line ever"", which is to call 911 for a beautiful girl as Barney tells her that ""she must have internal bleeding"" as ""she is an angel that fell straight out of heaven"".

Ted describes his perfect girl to Lily (attractive, college educated, wants 2 kids, likes dogs, Otis Redding, likes crosswords, into sports, plays the bass guitar), who says that Ted is never going to meet anyone who meets all the criteria that Ted has set out. Ted gets an unexpected present when he's contacted by Bob from Love Solutions, Ellen Pierce's former matchmaking company (which was bought out by a high-end meats and textile conglomerate who wanted to diversify) with whom Ted signed up six months earlier. They've found his soul mate. After reading this woman's file, Ted is convinced that she is indeed his soul mate. But on what is supposed to be their first date, Ted gets an emergency telephone call from Lily, who needs his help.

Lily has found out about an art fellowship in San Francisco, and decides to apply, even though it could ruin the wedding plans. She is forced to reveal her plans and call Ted when a tire on Marshall's car goes flat near Dutchess county on her way to the interview. Ted takes a cab to meet Lily. She tells Ted that she is still having doubts about marrying Marshall and wants to see if she can get into this art fellowship and see what happens. Lily tells Ted that she is really nervous about the wedding and specifically that marrying Marshall means giving up on all the dreams Lily had to roam the world and become a painter. Lily claims that she only wants to find out if she can get in or not.

Ted tries to convince her not to go to the required interview in New Haven. Lily knows it is a mistake but she has to know for sure if she can do it, and leaves Ted on the side of the road quite far from town. Ted sends her an angry message but reminds her to pick up milk on the way home. He calls Barney, but Barney puts Marshall on the phone and Ted claims it was a prank because he does not want Marshall to know why he was all the way out in Dutchess County.

She tells Ted that a few weeks ago, she enrolled for an art course in SFO and now she has been accepted. The course means that Lily can't marry Marshall just yet. Lily is terribly conflicted between her love for Marshall and her fear of not having lived her life. Once Ted fixes the flat, Lily leaves Ted to go and attend the art course interview, which is what she was doing out there in the first place. Ted calls Lily and leaves her a message to bring Milk when she gets back home.

Finally Ted gets Robin to come to his location and pick him up. As Robin drops Ted at McLaren's to start his date with his perfect match, Ted realizes that Robin is the only perfect girl for him. Ted goes home and finds Lily talking to Marshall. Lily tells Ted that she got the ""Milk"" (milk standing for admission at the art course). Ted tells Marshall that he didn't go on his date as he wants Robin. Marshall says to Ted that it's a mistake, but Ted replies that it's a mistake he has to make (basically giving his blessings to Lily to go for the art course)."

Barney (acting on behalf of the Universe) slaps Ted, telling him it's a bad idea. That weekend, a storm front is moving over New York, with predictions of heavy rains, that causes Robin's office to cancel their annual camping off-site. Sandy is disappointed as he wanted to sleep with Robin.

Ted tells them that he will try only one more time, and if it does not work out, he will accept that it is not meant to be. Ted then surprises Robin in her apartment with candy, flowers, and a group of musicians with blue instruments (in reference to the Blue French horn he stole for her on their first date).

Robin, while surprised, cannot give Ted a definite answer, especially after he learned that Robin's company camping trip is back on (since the storm has changed directions and is now headed into the Atlantic ocean) and Sandy Rivers is trying to date her now that he is moving on to CNN. Sandy has recommended Robin for the lead anchor position to replace him. Robin agrees to have dinner with Sandy on the official camping trip. Ted finally accuses Robin of ignoring her true feelings and urges her to ""touch the ground"", but it fails to win her over.

Ted walks out frustrated, but breaks his promise by trying to get Robin again by doing a rain dance. He believes that he can make it rain over NYC with his rain dance, which will cancel Robin's camping trip and thus her date with Sandy. After he convinces Penelope (a girl Barney hooked up with twice) to help him (as she has a Ph.D. in Native American studies), Ted tries to do a rain dance (even though Penelope had never ever seen a rain dance, but had read extensively about it), which ultimately proves successful, and he then goes over to Robin's. Penelop & Barney end up having sex again. Ted yells up to her from the street, telling her to come down (alluding to his previous demands for her to ""touch the ground""), and the two finally become a couple.

While Ted is finally finding success, Marshall is encountering the opposite. After having learned about Lily's acceptance into an art fellowship in San Francisco (from the answering machine), he begins to worry that their relationship is in danger. Marshall and Lily argue almost non-stop as to what will happen and Lily reveals that, despite having promised herself she would not go, she actually wants to, even though the wedding is only weeks away. She says she needs to do this before she settles down for the rest of her life. Marshall decides not to support Lily as he doesn't know if Lily will ever return if she finds success as a painter.

Due to the length of their arguments, Marshall and Lily have developed a ""pause function"", allowing them to temporarily drop the argument to do something else (like going to the Red Lobster and having lunch). As the argument reaches a head, Lily tries to pause the argument but Marshall refuses, which leads to the two having sex.

As Ted heads back in a cab from Robin's apartment, Future Ted tells his kids that although New York looked the same, in one night everything had changed.

Her panic mounts, and she hastily scribbles the words, ""call the nurse"" on the whiteboard before collapsing in a grand mal seizure. A month later Wilson introduces the teacher's case to close friend House. House is worried people will think he's a patient because of his limp. When Wilson suggests he wear a lab coat, House tells him he's afraid people will think he is a doctor. House thinks that the patient has a brain tumor, but Wilson asks him to take the case because she's his cousin. Wilson doesn't think its cancer because she isn't improving with radiation therapy. Wilson reminds him that House has three overqualified doctors working for him that would love to work on the case. House meets with his team and reminds them that ""everybody lies"". New hire Foreman is wondering why House isn't with the patient, but Cameron tells him that House doesn't like meeting patients. At this point, House has stopped thinking it's a tumor. Chase thinks it is a aneurysm or stroke. Cameron thinks it might be mad cow disease. Foreman thinks it might be an encephalopathy despite a negative blood test. House tells them all to proceed with the appropriate tests. Cuddy comes looking for House to berate him for not working hard enough, including being six years behind in clinic duty. He says he's going home - he can't be fired because he has tenure and is always at the hospital during his assigned work hours. Cuddy agrees that that he still has a good reputation but it will go to hell if he doesn't do his job. Cameron and Foreman start to do a test, but it's canceled on Cuddy's orders - she's taken away all of House's hospital privileges, the only thing she has the power to do to House without board approval. An enraged House confronts her but Cuddy is unconcerned with his threats. She tells him to go and do his job. He tells the team to do the MRI, then goes to do clinic duty. The team start the MRI but the patient starts to feel ill and then starts to have trouble breathing. They get her out of the MRI, but she isn't breathing because of pulmonary edema. Chase performs a tracheotomy and intubates her. He then compliments Cameron on realizing the patient was in distress so that they could get her out of the machine in time. They manage to stabilize the patient and get her conscious. She had an allergic reaction to the dye used in the contrast study. House tells the team to give the patient prednisone. He thinks she might have vasculitis even though it is extremely unlikely. However, the only way to test her is to give her the drugs and see if she responds. However, the patient realizes they aren't treating her for cancer, and is relieved she might not have a tumor. Chase is upset that they might be misleading the patient into thinking she doesn't have cancer. Foreman goes to the classroom to do an environmental scan. He finds a parrot and thinks it might be Psittacosis. However, House dismisses it because the none of the kids are sick and it is less likely they would take hygiene precautions. House tells him to break into the patient's apartment to do another environmental scan. Foreman is resistant, but House knows that Foreman served time for breaking and entering as a juvenile. He says that's why he hired Foreman. Foreman reminds House he can't be fired for refusing to break into someone's home. Cuddy asks House why he is giving the patient steroids. She comes to the conclusion that House is guessing and she wants to stop the treatment. They start to argue about who is in charge. She reminds House he has no evidence that the patient has vasculitis. He asks her why she's so afraid of making mistakes. Cuddy goes to see the patient and stop the steroids, but when she arrives she finds that the patient has improved greatly and has an appetite. Cuddy realizes she may have been wrong. Wilson examines the patient, who really wants to meet Dr. House. She asks if he's a good man. Wilson says House is a good doctor. He does admit that House is his friend, and that House may even care about him. All of a sudden, the patient complains that she can't see, then has a seizure. Her heart rate skyrockets and she goes into cardiac arrest. They defibrillate the patient and test her for brain damage by having her arrange pictures to form the elements of a story, but she can't manage it. However, she passes the test five minutes later. They realize that although her sight has returned, her brain is dying. House tells them to stop all treatment. It isn't a tumor and the steroids helped, but they don't know why. House admits he is stumped. Foreman decides to follow House's orders to break into the patient's house and asks Cameron to come along because the police are usually easier to deal with when a pretty white girl is around. Foreman and Cameron search the patient's home. Foreman is discussing his former criminal record. Cameron says she was 17 before she had a criminal record. Foreman fixes himself a sandwich and says he's a bit upset he got the job because of his criminal record and not his perfect academic record at both Columbia University and Johns Hopkins Medical School. Cameron says she didn't do nearly as well as Foreman in school and starts wondering how she got the job. They report to House that they couldn't find anything to explain her symptoms, but Foreman reports that she isn't Wilson's cousin - she had ham and Wilson is Jewish. Wilson bluffs, but then gets the patient's name wrong. House calls Foreman an idiot - House has realized that has a tapeworm from eating pork, something that would never have occured to him if he still believed the patient was Jewish. That would explain why she reacted well to the steroids initially, but then got worse. Tapeworms usually stay in the digestive system, but the eggs can pass into the bloodstream and into the brain. However, the steroids started to kill the worm and now it's death is stirring up the patient's immune system. There is no way to test for it except by trying to treat it. However, the patient is tired of being treated and wants to go home and die. House goes to see the patient and calls her an idiot for refusing treatment. She reminds him that his previous diagnosis was wrong. She asks why he's crippled and he explains that he had an infarction in his thigh and they didn't figure out what was wrong until it was too late to treat it. She thinks he avoids patients because he doesn't want people to see him crippled. He tells her there is no way to die with dignity - everyone dies and it's always ugly. You can only live with dignity. However, the patient still refuses treatment. The team wants House to claim she's mentally incompetent but he won't do it. He's solved the case and he feels the work is done. The patient wanted proof, but House can't do that. Chase says there might be a way to prove it to her - do an x-ray in her leg where there is likely to be a worm. House enthusiastically agrees. They do the x-ray and find a worm larva. She agrees to the drug to treat it and is surprised that it only takes two pills a day for a month. There are side effects, but they are manageable. Cameron asks House why he hired her. He asks her why she thought he did it. He says he hired Foreman because of his criminal record, Chase because his dad called, and Cameron because she was extremely pretty. When she is shocked, he says he did it because she worked hard despite the fact she didn't have to.... gorgeous women usually opt for an easy life and they don't go to med school to work really hard unless they are damaged. At that moment, Cameron's pager goes off. They manage to bring the patient's class in to visit her despite the rule about ""family only"". House asks Wilson why he lied about the patient being his cousin. He says it got House to take the case. They talk about lying while watching a medical drama."
