We watch a car drive through a snowy expanse. A man with a bad haircut, with severe bangs, drives.

An onscreen title card tells that what we're about to see is true story and happened in Minnesota in 2006 but the names have been changed to protect the survivors. But, everything else, it says is told exactly as it happened.

The car hits a deer and veers off the road. The trunk pops open and a chubby man, clad only in boxer shorts jumps out and begins running away from the car and the road into the surrounding snow covered field and woods. The driver, who has a head injury gets out slightly dazed and appraises the deer.

We cut to a washer in a basement that is clearly broken making a loud noise as it spins. Upstairs the owners Lester Nygaard and his wife are having lunch-- tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches. Lester's wife is an awful harpie who is complaining to Lester that, basically, he is not a man because he can't fix the washer, doesn't make enough money, and is not his younger, more successful brother Chaz. She figures she married the wrong Nygaard brother since Chaz's wife Kitty is always talking about how successful he is, including that he recently got a promotion after just one year. Lester says it's just slow right now and that he needs to head back to work. She tells him that he can make his own success. And that he has to try harder and maybe wear a better tie. He points out she bought him this tie. She says she would've bought him a better tie if he was a better salesman. He takes a look at the washer, in frustration.

He heads back to work and tries, unsuccessfully, to upsell insurance to a couple who are expecting. They just want to get her on his health insurance. Lester tries to scare them into buying life insurance. They don't bite.

Lester goes to the appliance store and looks longingly at new washer-dryer sets. He runs into his old high school nemesis Sam Hess. He's a big bully and has raised two dumb sons who also appear to be bullies. Sam's big joke is to make Lester's last name Nygaard sound like ""nigger.' He reminisces with Lester about stuffing Lester in an oil drum and rolling him into the road and that his wife once gave him a handjob. He threatens Lester in front of his kids. Lester flinches and abruptly turns his head and whacks his face on the glass window hard. Hard enough to send him to the ER.

In the ER, he waits impatiently. While there he runs into the driver from the opening scene. We don't know it yet but his name is Lorne Malvo. Lester explains what happened to his nose and Lorne thinks it's incredibly humiliating that Lester let this bully embarrass him and if it were him he'd kill the guy. He overheard his name Sam Hess, and asks Lester if he wants him to take care of it. Lester is aghast at first, Lorne tells him just to say yes or no. Just then the nurse calls Lester's name and he says ""Yah"" to her but says nothing else to Lorne, just regards him suspiciously.

Local police chief Vern Thurman and deputy Molly Solverson survey the accident scene. They find the deer in the trunk. They deduce the driver likely hit their head since there is blood on the steering wheel. They then follow the footprints leading away from the car. Vern notes that his wife is about to give birth and they haven't settled on a name. They find the man from the trunk, frozen dead in the wood.

Vern heads home and chats with his very pregnant wife. They are very sweet together. He talks about the accident and says he thinks the dead guy was the driver. She says she wants to paint the nursery blue, or green. Vern says he's ready to paint whenever she decides. She says he's a good man and her sister as crazy to tell her not to marry him.

Lorne goes to see Sam Hess at the headquarters of his trucking company. He runs into his two idiot sons. Sam, and a group of large men with him, menacingly wonder what Lorne wants. He says he just wanted to get a look at him.

Lester and his awful wife go visit his younger, more successful brother Chaz and his wife Kitty and their oddball son Gordon who answers the door in a pirate hat and then slams it in their face. Chaz brags about his promotion to VP of sales and how he's getting the corner office. He bought a surround sound system with the raise. Lester's awful wife keeps pointing out how much better Chaz is. Kitty and Chaz talk about broadening Gordon's horizons and Chaz says there's more to life than Minnesota. Lester tells his brother he slipped on some ice.

They head to the garage and Chaz says he thinks Gordon has ""the autism"" because he draws on the walls and pees in a mason jar at night. Then Chaz shows letter an automatic machine gun he bought. It's technically illegal but he says he's an American who pays his taxes. The machine is very scary. He hands it to Lester and he drops it and breaks part of it. He calls Lester a screw up and says his wife Pearl is sick of it and he's embarrassed that he's his older brother. We don't see it but we hear Lester's wife Pearl complain on the way home that Lester didn't have to hit him.

We see a realty office in a strip mall in Reno. A man is on the phone asking ""Do you need it to look like an accident?"" A phone, in a long bank of phones, rings. The man answers. It's Lorne who says the job is done and the delay was due to car trouble but he's going to take care of some personal business for the next few days so he will take care of ""Duluth"" after that.

Lorne heads to a strip club and watches Sam Hess head to the back room with a stripper. He is doing her from behind when Lorne comes in and kills him with a knife to the back of the head. Spurting blood he falls on top of the stripper, who didn't see Lorne.

Vern's phone rings and he tells his wife he has to head off to check out a homicide. She says she loves him and he returns the sentiment. Molly picks him up and they head to the crime scene.

She asks what she should put for cause of death and since the knife is sticking out of his neck Vern says it's self-explanatory. A nauseated fellow cop named Bill fidgets in the background. He says he's already thrown up, but not in the crime scene, he went outside. Vern takes a closer look and recognizes Sam Hess, which makes them wonder if this has something to do with organized crime since the trucking business is shady and Molly thinks he's tied to a syndicate of gun runners in Fargo. Vern isn't as sure as Molly, who seems excited at the idea of organized crime.

Lorne heads to a motel where a woman is berating her employee. He tries to rent a room and he gives the woman a hard time. She's trying to explain it's a different room rate if he has another person or a pet with him. He asks how much it would cost if he had pet spiders or bacteria. She gets frustrated. He says he just wants to know the policy because he's a student of institutions. She wonders if he wouldn't be better off at another motel. He says it's just him. He head across the parking lot and asks the young man why he lets the owner talk to him like that. The kids asks what he should do. He tells him a story of how he once pissed in a man's gas tank and says the car never drove straight again. He heads to his room, looks out his window and sees the kids pissing in the woman's gas tank. He calls the front desk and tattles on him. She comes running out.

Molly has breakfast at Lou's coffee shop. Lou is her dad. She tells him about the Sam Hess murder. Vern comes in and Lou invites him to ice fishing and Vern declines. Molly says she's been thinking about the dead guy in the woods. She says the car was stolen and the driver was injured and the dead guy wasn't. They talk about Hess and says the stripper didn't get a good look but she's going to run down whether the knife was bought in Bimidji. Vern says Molly will make a good chief someday. Bill has seniority but Vern thinks it will be hers when the time comes.

We cut to the living room of Sam Hess. His widow is smoking and wearing a low-cut top and push-up bra. Sam's business partner assures her that guys from Fargo are coming to take care of it. She's mad that Sam made her live in the North Pole and had the nerve to cheat on her. She says she's going to sing at his funeral. She sings and then starts to cry. The boys are freaked out. Mickey, the older son gets a phone call. It's Lorne. He's claiming he's his father's lawyer. He tells him that his dad left everything in his will to his younger brother Mo who he said he was his favorite. Mickey asks Mo to come outside and starts attacking him with a bat. The police have showed up to talk to them and ask about her Sam's business. His business partner says she doesn't know anything about the business and Sam was a pillar of the community who was voted Bimidji businessman of the year....in 1996 and 98. They note that the sons have low level rap sheet and that there might have been ties to a crime syndicate. The business partner is faux aghast that they're calling Sam a criminal in front of his widow. Molly sees the boys fighting and runs outside and tackles Mickey. The widow laughs at the scene.

Lester happens to drive by the Motor Inn and notices Lorne walking in the parking lot. He arrives at work and is told to pull the Sam Hess file since Sam is dead. Lester is dazed and notes he went to high school with Sam. The guy tells him it's a shame since it was a big policy.

Lester goes to see Lorne, who feigns surprise to hear that Sam Hess is dead. Lorne implies Lester gave the word to kill him. Lester says he never said yes to killing him. Lorne says he never said no. Lester says that would never hold up in court. Lorne says no one's talking about court and he tells Lester his problem is that he spent his whole life thinking there are laws when they're aren't. He says the truth is Lester is more of a man today than he was yesterday and that he has to stand up to the grind of the everyday and the shit that bosses and wives make us eat or else we'll be washed away.

Vern's wife calls and says she thinks the nursery should be white. Even though it already is. She wants a fresh coat. He says he'll stop by the hardware store and pick up some options. She says it's finally sinking in that they're having a baby. He says he can't wait.

As he's leaving the hardware store Molly calls and tells him that Mickey is pretty banged up and that also, she was talking to one of the nurses who told her that Lester Nygaard was talking to a man with a cut on his head in the ER the day before and that she heard them mention Sam Hess. Vern says he knows Lester and will go over to his house and talk to him. Molly offers but Vern says he's got it covered.

Back at Lester's he thinks he's fixed the washer. But then he turns it on and it's not fixed after all and is in fact worse. Awful Pearl taunts him and emasculates him and says he's not a man and she should've never married him and her mom thought he was a loser. She says he won't even face her during sex. He says that's her. She says it's so she can picture a real man. He can't take it anymore and he grabs a hammer and she wonders if he's going to hit her. He whacks her right on the head with it. She is dead. He is freaked out. And then he keeps whacking her. Spraying blood on the walls. He freaks out some more. And then he begins to clean up the crime scene, taking off and bagging his clothes and wiping and hiding the murder weapon. He then calls Lorne to ask for help. Lorne asks if he's been a bad boy. Lester says he has and Lorne says he's on the way.

Lester goes to get his shotgun and practices pointing it out the door saying ""you killed her!"" Apparently, his plan is to kill Lorne and frame him for Pearl's murder. But before Lorne arrives, Vern arrives to talk to Lester about Sam Hess. Lester says he doesn't remember talking to someone else about Sam Hess. Vern notices the blood trail up from the basement and asks Lester to get on the ground. Vern looks down in the basement and sees Pearl as Lester says he didn't do anything. Vern calls for back up just as Lorne enters and Lorne shoots him in the back. Lorne asks if there are anymore cops. Lester says no and that he didn't tell him anything. Lorne heads for the basement. Lester pulls more shotgun shells out of his pocket and notices an injury on his hand from the hammer. Molly arrives outside. Lester runs to tell Lorne in the basement but he's gone. Lester runs himself headlong into the wall knocking himself out so he can say a man came in attacked him and his wife and then killed Vern. Molly sees Vern on the ground and busts in. Molly heads to the basement and sees that Lester is alive but that Pearl is dead. Bill arrives and gets ill at the sight of the blood and heads back upstairs.

More police arrive to Lester's house. Molly watches them pull a sheet over Vern's head. She heads outside and sees the paint cans in his cruiser. She heads to his house and gives Vern's wife the very bad news with a shake of her head and hands her the paint.

We cut to Duluth. A young cop named Gus Grimly is sitting in his cruiser chatting back and forth with his daughter about the Vikings game and homework on his walkie-talkie. A car squeals by and Gus takes off after it. Inside is Lorne Malvo, who overhears when Gus's daughter tries to call him on the walkie. Lorne convinces Gus that he should just go get in his car and drive away and his daughter is what is important and it's in everybody's interest if Gus just lets him go. He says every few years Gus will look at his daughter's face and think of this moment and know that he is alives because he chose light instead of darkness and didn't go down this road. Gus is taken aback by this, but he does let Lorne go. He seems shaken and disappointed in himself.

Lester wakes up in the hospital and again notes the small wound on his hand.

Molly is prepared to go ice-fishing with her dad. But when he asks her to be a hostess in his restaurant and give up being a cop and she declines, he says he knows people are less inclined to shoot a hostess than a cop. She says that's true and then says she's changed her mind on fishing and heads back to her cruiser."

Two men drive down the highway with the snowy expanse on either side. They are stoic. One is bearded, the other clean-shaven with sideburns. They meet up with Max Gold at Sam Hess's trucking company. They say they're from Fargo but don't give names. Sideburns appears deaf and communicates with beard with sign language. Sideburns is sad that Bemidji has no library. Max agrees. Beard says Fargo wants to know what happened to Sam. Max reports he was stabbed in the back of the head at a strip club. The two men exchange a lot of sign language. They wonder if the killing was tied to the business. Max tells them about the visit from Lorne Malvo (although he doesn't know his name). He describes him, vaguely. They gesture again to one another. Max says Sam was his friend. Yes, he was a jerk but deep down he was Max's friend and he asks if they're going to find who did it. Sideburns gestures with the slashing throat move and Beard says they'll find him.

At the post-funeral gathering for Pearl at Kitty and Chaz's, Chaz invites Lester to stay and talks about selling the house. Lester wonders why he'd sell the house. Chaz says he doesn't have to but he should stay a few days while the cops clean up the messy crime scene. Lester flashes back to the shooting of Vern.

Later, Lester returns home and sees the crime scene himself including Vern and Pearl's pools of blood.

Molly visits Vern's grave.

At Vern's house his widow Ida takes care of the company that has come to comfort her. Molly does the dishes. Ida recalls a story Vern told about a boss he had who was killed by an errant hailstone. Molly talks about when her dad got shot during a traffic stop and how they came to tell her at school and that he was okay, even though he limps now. Bill comes in and tells him that they have a whole team of people worked out to come by and take care of Ida and help on the day of the delivery.

Molly says she wants to talk to Lester again about the whole Vern situation. Bill tries to put her off saying Lester already gave his statement. She says Vern was going over to talk about Hess and how Lester was maybe involved. Bill says Lester was a fainter in high school and he thinks the Hess murder is about the cutthroat world of regional trucking. He thinks it's a coincidence that Hess was murdered and then the massacre the next day at Lester's. Bill thinks it was a home invasion by a drifter. Molly and Ida convince him he should still talk to Lester but he says he's going to do all the talking.

Lester is still wandering through his house. He goes to Pearl's closet and smells her clothes and begins to wail with grief and remorse. Just then, Molly and Bill show up. He pulls himself together to answer their questions at his kitchen table. He mostly says he was concussed and has double vision and doesn't remember much. (He does, however, remember the grape gum they chewed as kids: Hubba Bubba.) He remembers his wife being dead on the floor, didn't hear the guy, and then he was attacked so he didn't remember Vern coming to the house. She mentions that Vern was there to talk to him about a man he met in the ER the day before. He says he doesn't remember this. Bill jogs his memory that Sam bullied him in high school. Molly is interested in this. Lester says he wasn't talking about Sam in the ER and the nurse must've mistook it when he said ""My face is a mess"" which sounds like Hess. She asks him to describe the guy. Lester says it's fuzzy. Bill shares his drifter theory and thinks it might be the guy from the hospital followed him home. Lester reiterates that he's fuzzy. Bill says he's satisfied. Molly says she has more questions but Bill drags her out. Lester says Pearl was a good wife and he keeps asking himself, who could've done a thing like this.

Lorne goes to a post office and quietly menaces the clerk into giving him a package without signing for it or giving his name or showing ID. It's a hardcover book called ""American Phoenix: The Stavros Milos Story."" This must be his new target. There is also a wallet inside with a fake ID that makes him a minister. He tells the clerk to have a blessed day.

Stavros Milos is the supermarket king of Minnesota. Lorne goes to see him. Milos has someone blackmailing him or a very specific amount of money: $43,613. He doesn't care why he just wants Lorne to find him. As they talk, Milos' security guy Semenko-- a big, older linebacker-type guy-- gives Lorne the stink-eye. He wanted to take care of the problem himself and not farm it out to Lorne. While they're talking Milos' adult son who appears developmentally disabled enters to tell a joke: ""What's a karate expert's favorite beverage? Kara-tea. Get it?"" Milos kicks him out. Lorne says he can find the guy and wants to know what Milos wants done with him. Milos wants to have Lorne ""send 'em packing."" He says to start with his soon-to-be-ex-wife who is suing him for half of his empire. Lorne asks Milos to sign his copy of the book. He then leaves and promptly steals a car someone left running as they brought their cart back to the store.

We see Gus Grimly in a police briefing at the Duluth Police Department. The briefing is on the Vern Thurman/Pearl Nygaard murders. The chief is saying they told Bimidji they'd let them know if they heard anything. Gus looks at the ticket that he didn't give Lorne that night. Later he wrestles with a dog, he's subbing on animal control duty.

He heads home and has dinner with his daughter. Burgers and chicken nuggets. As he changes out of his uniform he sees the woman across the street also changing her clothes. She sees him through the window and gives him an eyeful of herself in her lingerie, intentionally. He turns away and heads back to eat with his daughter. (The woman is having dinner with her family across the way: husband and children.) She reports they had an assembly on bullying at school. She says she asked what to do if the bully was bigger than you or had a knife and she was told to tell an adult. Gus agrees. She says she would do something to stop the bully anyway and assumes he would too since he's a cop. He says sometimes there's more than one right thing and that other considerations come into play when you're confronting danger, like he thinks about how he's responsible for her and if he's in a dangerous situation he could die or worse and then there would be no one to take care of her. She says it's his job. He says his more important job is taking care of her. She still says she'd do something.

Beard and Sideburns go to the strip club and are tipped off that a regular guy at the bar named Lenny may have been the killer. They kidnap the guy and bring him to Max Gold in their car trunk. Max confirms that this is not the guy.

Lorne goes to see Milos' wife, who is working out with her trainer who is covered in bronzer which he gets on Lorne when they shake hands. Lorne claims to be a man named Frank Peterson who works for her lawyer Mike. They want to get her the best settlement possible and says they estimate Milos' worth at $10 million. She says it is far north of that figure. He asks if she can confirm that Milos started the business from an inheritance from an uncle like he says in the book. She says one uncle died as a child and the other was a drunk. Just then Milos' son enters and Lorne/Frank distracts him with a joke: What kind of bone would a dog never eat? A trombone. He likes this and says his dad will like that one. She trash talks Milos and the son says he's his dad and she's his mom and everything is going to work out and she hugs him to her breast.

At his motel, Lorne listens to the call he taped of Lester calling him and telling him about his dead wife. He also looks at the ransom note and notices it's got bronzer on it, so it's probably the work of the trainer. Semenko bangs on his door and comes in and tells him it's time for him to butt out and Semenko will take care of Milos' problems. Lorne promptly goes into the restroom and sits down, door open, and takes a poop. Semenko is understandably disgusted. Lorne says nothing. He grabs Milos' book and starts reading. Semenko says he's on to him and that he warned him. He leaves, leaving the door open so anyone walking by can see Lorne pooping.

Bill calls Molly into his office, which used to be Vern's. Bill says he wants to make sure they're on the same page, that Lester isn't their guy and to call to other towns and see if there have been similar break-ins or state troopers and see if there were any suspicious stops. He tells her to leave poor Lester alone. She turns and sees office workers peeling Vern's name off the door to replace it with Bill's.

Lester goes in his basement and recovers the murder weapon, which he hid in the back of the washing machine. He then heads to Chaz and Kitty's agreeing that maybe it is a good idea for him to come stay with them. They put him in Gordon's room. In the closet, Lester finds one of the jars of urine that Chaz mentioned in the pilot that Chaz keeps there, for reasons unknown.

They all watch TV and eat dinner on TV trays, with them all complimenting Kitty. Chaz invites Lester to go hunting. Kitty says maybe Lester doesn't feel like being around guns and violence right now. Lester says he's been thinking he may sell the house and get a fresh start. Chaz says his buddy says it's a hot market. Kitty agrees saying there's bad memories in the house.

Lester goes to the pharmacy to get a topical ointment for his wound on his hand. Molly shows up and wants to ask more questions. She asks again about the ER and his broken nose. He says he just remembered something and leaves and tells Molly he's feeling harassed. He says she should be out looking for the animal that killed his wife. She notes that Pearl wasn't the only victim and her friend is dead too and it's just odd that a witness said he was talking about Sam Hess the day he died and then his wife and Vern and that Lester had differences with Sam in the past. Lester says he told her that he hadn't seen Sam since high school. She stops him as he's trying to get in Pearl's car-- his is in the shop-- and he tells her to ask Bill, her boss, who says he was satisfied. He points out his wife is dead and she's harassing him. She says she's not. He says it was a break-in and drives off.

Molly chats with her dad the next day at his coffee shop. She fills him in on the Lester/Hess connection but says Bill is putting her off. Lou says Bill has no common sense but plenty of self-esteem. She tells him Bill's drifter theory. Lou says Bill's chief so he sets the agenda. She says she knows but she goes through the timeline from the car accident to the ER to Lester's wife and Vern. He reminds her of the time when she was 5 when she was put under gas to get her teeth fixed. He calls her a soft little girl in a hard world. She says she's 31 and carries a gun. He talks about how a schoolteacher wouldn't have to deal with these problems and police work is one thing but this thing she's dealing with is likely savagery. He says if she gets married and has kids one day she needs to look in their eyes and see innocence. She says he talks a lot. Bill enters and tells him Lester called him upset and Bill says he thought they were clear that they were focusing on the drifter angle. He tells her that he's the chief and that they all have to fall in line behind him and she's off the case. But, he says it could be good for her because he's making her lead on the dead frozen guy from the accident. She leaves. Lou says he'll see her for dinner.

Sideburns and Beard let the wronged suspect out of the trunk. They knock him unconscious. They drag him onto a frozen lake. They drill a hole in the ice and dump him in it. He weakly protests, ""No, wait."" They head back to the car."

We open on an a tall office building. Inside its quiet halls a man works at a cubicle by the window, an aquarium as his screensaver. He looks around and seems frustrated. He looks again and sees Lorne down the hallway and starts saying ""Shit, shit, shit"" to himself. He starts pleading with Lorne who drags him down the hall by his tie in full view of other employees and security cameras. He drags him all the way to the parking garage. The man pleads with him as Lorne shows him a knife. Lorne strips him to his underwear and throws him in his trunk. The man feebly pounds on the trunk. We see from his vantage point the car crashing. When it does he runs off in to the snowy woods. This is the car crash from the opening of the pilot. He scampers through the woods in his undies and sits in the snow. He freezes to death. This is how Molly and Vern found him.

We cut to Molly, chewing on her lip and thinking while driving her cruiser.

Molly goes to the office building and takes witness statements. They all heard different things: drugs, gambling, pedophile. The security guard shows her the tape and she says it's hard to tell much from the picture. They freeze it on the best vantage of Lorne. They wonder if this is their Bemidji murderer. She says it could be. She looks at the picture and says ""Who are you?""

Lorne goes to the personal trainer at his gym and shows him he got bronzer on the ransom note. The trainer pulls him aside and tries to plead his case and asks him not to tell Helena. Lorne tells him he actually works for Stavros. He asks him to squeeze an exercise ball to calm down and says he has two questions and a comment. He asks him why $43,613. He says he wants to start a Turkish bath. He asks what the note meant about ""knowing about the money."" The trainer says he doesn't really know, he was bluffing off of what Helena said to him about her husband's nefarious dealings. Lorne's comment: ""You're an idiot."" He says the good news for the trainer is that Lorne is now taking over the blackmail and now the trainer works for him. The trainer says he's confused. Lorne says the first thing they need is a new blackmail letter.

Gus sits in the Duluth precinct house and thinks back to his encounter with Lorne. He looks up the license plate number. It was Lester's car. Gus feels guilty. He goes to see the Lieutenant, who is in the john trying to do his, um, business and none too pleased to be bothered. He tells the Lieutenant about the car and how it belongs to one of the victims of the Bemidji murders. The lieutenant is angry that he pulled over a stolen car and let it go with a warning. Gus says it wasn't listed as stolen at the time. The LT says it's Sioux Falls all over again. He tells him to call Bemidji and tell them he screwed up and to look through mugbooks for the driver.

Lester sits in his kitchen, hearing his wife's nagging voice in his head. The house is still a mess. He flashes back to Vern being shot again.

He heads to work. They welcome him back kindly. They wonder if he's ready. He says he can't sit around all day. They ask if he wants to take the papers out to Gina Hess about Sam's policy. He says he will.

He heads out there. The house is for sale and the boys are shooting arrows into the for sale sign. They harass Lester as he enters the house. She answers the doors and calls the boys wolves.

When she hears he's from the insurance company she's excited and invites him in. She apologizes for the boys and asks when she gets her money. He offers his condolences. She just wants to know about the money. He says in cases of murder they have to wait for the coroner. She recognizes him as the guy from the double murder whose wife was killed. They have a drink. She says he should get back out there, since he's not a bad-looking guy, if a little small. She asks if he liked his wife and says she didn't love her husband and notes Lester knew him and says it never got better. She met Sam at a strip club in Vegas. Lester says he's never been to a strip club. She throws her leg over his head and gives him a tease. She says Sam promised her the good life and now she's stuck in the Yukon with her idiot sons. She starts flirting with him and asks what she has to do to get that money quick. The boys see her sitting on Sam's lap and the younger one shoots the older one in the butt with an arrow. When Lester looks out he sees Beard and Sideburns lurking in the woods behind Sam's house.

Lorne purchases some Adderall out of the back of a van from a scruffy guy who is also offering clean urine, blood and other medical stuff. He tries to sell him a zombie survival kit. Lorne declines.

Molly has lunch with an old friend who is impressed that she's a cop and that she has a gun and stuff. She asks about the Vern-Pearl murders. She asks if Molly's dating anyone. Molly says no. The friend moved to St. Paul after high school, she's divorced since her husband cheated on her and now she's online dating. She says from time to time you get a bad egg like the one who stole all her panties and the one who had a harelip. But now she's dating a guy named Roger who took her to Acapulco, where he had spider eggs laid in his neck and they crawled out while they were having sex. Now she's decided to stay in Minnesota.

Stavros's dog awakes and runs outside where he is met by Lorne. Stavros calls out to his dog. Lorne lets himself in and replaces Stavros's regular prescription with the Adderall. All the while Stavros is calling the dog, who is named King. He sees the dog, dead outside his door. There is another ransom note by his body. Stavros is sad, angry, and scared.

Molly drives home from lunch and hears an ad for Lester's insurance agency.

Beard and Sideburns drive through town.

Lester looks at his hand wound in the bathroom at work. It is getting infected. He squeezes pus out of it. Beard and Sideburns visit Lester at work. They stand silently looking at him. His phone rings and it's a tow lot in Duluth calling about the car. They continue to look at him and around the office, which is otherwise empty. The tow lot tells him to come with $150 cash to pick it up. He addresses Beard and Sideburns. Sideburns signs at him, Lester looks to Beard for translation who says: ""Sam Hess."" They say they saw him with Sam's wife through the window and wonder if he was celebrating. They surround his chair on either side. Just then Molly shows up to talk to him. He pretends to have been giving them an insurance quote. Beard plays along.

Molly wonders who they are. He says they had question about vacation insurance. She pretends she's interested in talking about life insurance in case something happened to her and who would take care of her dad. She drops a folder and Lester goes to help her pick it up and inside he sees the screengrab of Lorne in there and it throws him just a little. He offers to give her the long speech and she says she's got time but instead he hands her a pamphlet and tells him to give her a call and says he has to close up, hurrying her out with a smile.

Lorne goes to see Stavros who is very upset about his dog. He no longer thinks it's his wife who would never hurt an animal. He shows Lorne the new ransom note that has now raised the price to $1 million. Lorne asks who else knows about the money. Stavros says no one, it's impossible. Stavros pops pills, which are now Adderall. Lorne notices the stained glass behind Stavros' desk and asks if he's Greek Orthodox. He says he and God have something akin to a New Year's resolution. He wants the dog killer found. Lorne proposes moving onto the property to better protect him. He tells Lorne to get it done.

Gus is looking through the mug books and can't find any sign of Lorne. His daughter sits at his desk with him. He seems frustrated. She asks what's wrong. He tells her he made a mistake and now he has to call another jurisdiction and tell them because of him their suspect got away. She tells him it would be better to do in person.

Molly shows Bill the suspect photo of Lorne from the security video screen grab and tells him that she ""accidentally"" showed it to Lester and he says it was like he saw a ghost and Lester knows him and not from a casual chat. Bill is ""super ticked"" and isn't listening to Molly on Lester. He says to put out an APB on screengrab guy and leave Lester alone and turns his back on her. She is frustrated.

Gus goes to see Molly to fall on his sword. His daughter says to tell the truth and say he's sorry which is what he always tells her to do. He explains what happened, that he gave the guy a warning but then he had a feeling so he ran the plates and the car belonged to Lester. She is surprised and said Lester said his car was in the shop. Gus says Lester wasn't driving. Molly shows him Lorne's picture and he's surprised now and says that's him. She's curious why he didn't ask for the guy's license and registration. He says he asked but he threatened him. He's very embarrassed and says he was a really dangerous looking guy with really scary eyes. His daughter comes in and asks for a dollar for the vending machine. Molly gives her a token. Molly asks about his daughter and he says she's 12, Greta, and her mother's been gone 10 years. It's just the two of them. If she was going to be angry, she isn't now that she sees why he did what he did. She asks them to have a burger before they head back. Gus says he doesn't want to be a bother. She says it's none and maybe a clue will fall out. She goes to put out an APB on Lorne.

They go to her dad's place, Lou's. Lou asks if they're alone and Greta says a very pretty lady is joining them. Lou notices Gus's uniform and asks if he knows this guy Ben Schmidt, turns out it's Gus's boss. Lou calls him a prick and says they worked on a joint task force once in Sioux Falls. (Which is something that the LT mentioned earlier to Gus as well as being a debacle but didn't elaborate.) Gus agrees he's a prick. Molly enters and says she needs a milkshake tonight, a double. Greta has one too. Molly orders burgers

Gus says it's strange Lester never reported his car stolen. Molly says Lester's mixed up in nasty business. Molly asks Greta if she has a boyfriend. She blushes and says no. Gus says she's too young. Molly tells him to keep telling himself that. She then recounts the spider egg story-- sans sex. They are both perplexed. Molly says she's not sure if she wants to live in a world where something like that can happen to a person. They all drink their milkshakes in happy silence.

Lester goes to see his brother Chaz, who's working in his gun case in his garage. Lester asks him which ones make the biggest hole. They head out, protective earmuffs on and Lester lets off some stress firing an automatic weapon while Chaz cheers him on.

Lorne reads from the Bible in voiceover, it's a passage about Moses.

Beard and Sideburns hang out in an ice fishing shack.

Stavros pops pills, very fidgety. He hops in the shower. The shower, inexplicably begins to run red, as if it is blood. Stavros freaks out. Lorne goes to his car and covers up to three huge containers of pig's blood."

We open, once again, on a car driving down a snowy road. This time we have flashed back to 1987 and a young Stavros and his wife and infant son. She is mad they are relocating to this godforsaken tundra. And then they run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. Stavros spent the last five dollars he had. He gets out of the car to think. He tries to flag down a passing truck but it blows by him sending him to the ground. He prays to god to help him and says if he does he will be his faithful servant. He walks to the side of the road and sees an ice scraper. He scrapes at the snow and uncovers a briefcase full of money, a lot of money. He is stunned. He gets back into the car saying ""God is real! God is real!""

We cut back to the present where Stavros is getting his house's water system checked out in light of last week's bloody shower. The ""plumber"" checking it out is his wife's personal trainer. Oddly, Stavros does not recognize him. The guy says there is nothing wrong with the system and on his way out offhandedly notes that maybe it was a plague from God. Stavros seizes him by the shirt and shakes him. The plumber/trainer walks away saying Stavros is crazy.

Gus gets a call to check out a dead dog that may have been killed. It turns out it's Stavros' dog. He heads out there and runs smack into Lorne Malvo and recognizes him right away. Lorne quickly makes a call saying Frank Peterson needs the package. Gus arrests him and says they'll figure out the charges at the station. On the ride to the police station Lorne tells Gus he's making a mistake. He adds that Gus himself will be saying this later today.

He brings Lorne to the police station and Lorne immediately adopts a folksy Minnesota accent and claims this is all a mistake and he's just a sweet, local minister.

Gus calls Molly and says he's got Lorne aka Frank. She wants to head over because she thinks he's also the guy who put the dead body in the car, but once she tells the chief, Bill, what's happened, he bigfoots the case and says that he will go.

Lester heads home to pick up a few things with Chaz who is freaked out that the blood is still on the floor. Lester goes upstairs and unwraps his hand which is getting more and more swollen and infected and clearly really hurts. His phone rings and it's Beard, of Beard and Sideburns. He accuses Lester again of sleeping with Sam's wife and conspiring with her to kill him for the insurance money. Beard asks Lester if it was worth his life and then hangs up.

Beard goes back into Lou's coffee shop and sits down for breakfast with Sideburns, who asks what Lester said. Beard says he didn't say anything and they never do. Sideburns is mad and signs that he wants to hear Lester actually confess before they kill him. So Beard says they will grab him and make him talk. They are frustrated with each other and leave after having drawn the attention in the coffee shop.

Lorne calls the plumber/trainer Don, who is waiting for his call in a pet store. Lorne has sent him to pet stores to get something for him and says for him to pick him up in 2 hours.

In the interrogation, Bill and Gus's terrible boss Lt. Schmidt do a terrible job interrogating him -- ""Frank"" says he was at church bingo and many will swear to this-- and even though they have Molly's screengrab of him dragging the guy from the trunk, they claim it's too grainy to really make it out. When Lorne's alibi checks out they let him go.

Molly meets with the woman and the young man who work at the motel where Lorne stayed the night of the murders and they tell her they do remember an odd dude and his name was Lorne Malvo. They recognize him from the grainy screengrab and the young man said he had some tokens from the Lucky Penny-- where Sam Hess was killed. She calls Gus and tells him.

As Lorne is leaving, his boss tells him that he's letting him go and is on desk duty for three weeks. Gus says ""you're making a mistake."" Lorne hears this and turns around and smiles at him. Gus confronts him -- calling out his real name-- and he stops. Gus asks how he can just lie like that. Lorne says to ""Did you know that the human eye can see more shades of green than any other color? Why?"" Gus is confused. Lorne says when Gus figure out the answer to that question he'll have an answer to his question about how Lorne can do what he does.

Don picks up Lorne and says he got what he wanted at the pet store in the back.

Lester leaves a shop and is abducted by Beard and Sideburns and thrown in a trunk. He calls his brother -- who is home watching porn-- from the trunk to get his help. But when he realizes he has a taser in his pocket he tells his brother he's just pranking him. Beard and Sideburns drag Lester to the middle of a frozen pond and Sideburns begins drilling a hole while Beard tells Lester that he will confess to killing Sam. Lester says he didn't do it and that a man did. But before he says what man, he tases Beard and runs away. Sideburns did not hear this, obviously, and his back was to them so he didn't see it.

Lester runs back to the road and sees a cop looking at the car. He asks for a ride back to town. The cop complains he's not a taxi service so Lester punches him in the nose. The cop arrests him. As they're driving away, Lester sees Beard and Sideburns glaring at him from the edge of the woods.

Stavros, still whacked out from the speed he's unknowingly taking is confronted by his son in his office about being nicer to his mother. Stavros isn't having it. Suddenly, what looks like a cricket appears on his desk. He whacks it with a book. And then, just as suddenly Stavros and his son notice more crickets, all over the office and the walls. They walk out into the grocery store and it is totally overrun by bugs, customers are knocking things over to get out of the store. Stavros gets a phone call with a disguised voice saying to amass 1 million dollars in unmarked bills and that he will get a call with the drop location and remember ""God is watching."" We pull back and see Lorne standing on the roof. Stavros again says ""God is real.""

Beard and Sideburns go to a local watering hole to have a drink. Beard appears to be drunk. He and Sideburns get into a knock down drag out fight destroying the bar.

Gus meets Molly at her dad's coffee shop and tells her about Lorne's color green riddle. She explains it's for identifying predators. She says that since we evolved from being apes and apes were in the forest surrounded by shades of green they needed to tell the difference between many greens to detect predators. He asks what do they do now? She says, ""Lester.""

Lester sits in a jail cell, contemplating lying down to sleep, just as... Beard and Sideburns are brought into the holding cell with him. At first he stands. Then he sits. They glare down at him."

We open on a much more temperate Bemidji, the snow appears to be goe.

Lester is in a sporting goods store buying socks from the ""Irregular"" table. (Some ladies' socks were mixed in, the clerk isn't sure which is which.) Lester says he'll roll the dice. He bargains to pay, the clerk wants him to buy the socks for $55 and says he'll throw in the 12 gauge shotgun.

We cut to Lester at home and Pearl telling him to be careful since if anyone could shoot themselves in the face with an unloaded firearm, it's Lester. (So, it would appear we have flashed back to spring, when Pearl was still alive.) Lester puts the gun and ammo on top of the bookshelf.

We flash forward to the moment that Lester retrieved the weapon and called Lorne and prepared himself to shoot Lorne on his arrival. He puts the gun in the bathroom. And of course Vern showed up, Lorne showed up and found the gun and shot Vern with Lester's gun. We see the buckshot enter Vern's body and also a stray one that went into Lester's hands, thus causing his current awful, painful swollen infection.

We cut to the present and Lester literally sweating it out in the jail cell between Beard and Sideburns, resting his infected hand on his knee. Lester apologizes for tasing Beard. Sideburns takes off his boot and sock and puts his foot back in his boot. Lester tries to explain he's just an insurance agent, that's it. Beard asks who ""him"" was that Lester said killed Sam. Lester tries to demur but Beard says Lester said ""him"" like he had a face in mind. Beard clamps down on Lester's infected hand, he screams, Sideburns stick his sock in Lester's mouth to muffle the screams. He gives them Lorne Malvo's name. They ask where he is. Lester is afraid he's going to puke. Beard says if he throws up he will actually kill him. Lester tells him about the car and the fact that there is an APB out on Lorne and there are pictures of him. Beard and Sideburns make bail. But Beard asks the Sgt. if they can stay. They can't. Beard tells him to have a doctor look at his hand. Lester pukes.

Molly does her laundry and watches a nature program about the Everglades. She shakes her head and says to herself it has to be done. She goes to the precinct and tries to convince the chief that there have been some interesting developments that warrant looking at Lester again including the info from the motel owner about Lorne and the tokens from the Lucky Penny where Sam was killed. The chief is distracted at first setting up plows for an incoming storm but when she gets to the part where the stripper said that Hess was bragging about breaking the nose of a guy he used to bully-- Lester-- she gets his attention. She lays out the scenario: Sam breaks Lester's nose. Lester meets Malvo in ER. Sam is killed. Lorne goes to Lester's and kills Vern when Lester can't pay Malvo for the murder for hire, her theory. The chief says he's in custody for swinging at the cop and he agrees, finally, that they should talk to him.

Gus comes into Greta's room to use her computer. She helps him with it. They search for Lorne's pastor alias Frank Peterson. There's even a site with a picture of Malvo with it. Then they search Lorne's name. He tries to work out why Malvo was on the street he was on, on foot. He tells Greta he might go out for a bit.

Lorne goes back to the guy with the van and buys a police scanner and a walkie talkie. He just wants one but the guy says they come in pairs so you can talk to a friend. Lorne says he has no friends.

Lorne goes to see the trainer, Don Chumph. Don asks questions. Lorne tells him not to talk. He makes a call and records it. He calls Stavros. He is fully whacked out now by the drugs and says he's going to pay the blackmail since he broke a promise. Lorne tries to stall him and say to wait. Stavros explains about the plagues that have befallen him from the Book of Exodus like Pharoah and he's afraid his ""firstborn son"" will be next. He says Cemenko is taking Dmitri somewhere safe. He asks Lorne if he thinks he's crazy. Lorne says we're only as good as the promises we keep. Stavros says to meet him in an hour and they'll get the money together. Don is thrilled that Stavros is paying and he asks if he can roll around in the money. Lorne asks if Don has a closet that locks and a drill and screws. Don has all three. Lorne asks him to step in and locks and seals him in as he's asking about his cut. Lorne says he doesn't want him getting cold feet.

In the cell Lester is hallucinating about the night of the murders and meeting Malvo in the restaurant.

Molly takes him in an ambulance to the hospital. The EMT looks at the infected hand. She asks him about what happened and he babbles about socks and shotguns. She asks him if he paid Lorne to kill Sam. He's delirious so he makes it sound like he arranged it but never paid him. They take him into the hospital.

Beard and Sidebuns receive the police report with the picture of Lorne from a police informant.

It is late and Gus drinks milk at his table. He looks up and sees the man from across the way. The man waves. Gus waves back. The man opens his window. Gus opens his. The guy says he's got two kids and a wife who thinks he's loud so this is the time he gets. Gus says he's up accidentally. (This guy is married to the woman who showed off her body to Gus in the window a couple of episodes back.) The guy says he has a troubled mind and he will come to Gus. He comes over, they drink milk. The guy talks about the weather, his kids but says he won't complain, they're all gifts. Gus asks him an ethical question: Let's say you know a person is guilty but can't prove it and he has everyone else fooled? The guy says to find the proof. He says he's not a detective and he worries about Greta. The guy shares a parable: a rich man opens the paper and sees the world is full of misery and he says I have money, I can help and gives away all his money. But people still suffer. Another day, now poor, he sees another article in the paper that say organ donations save lives so he donates a kidney. He still knows people are suffering so he goes back and says he wants to donate all of his organs, everything that he is and has. The doctor says he can't, it's suicide and sends the man home. So the man gets in the tub and slits his own throat: the words organ donor are written on the wall. His gravestone reads: ""The man who gave everything."" Gus is confused as to the point of the parable. The point, he says, is only a fool thinks he can solve the world's problems. Gus says you have to try though, right?

Gus lies in bed, tortured, teary. He can't sleep. He gets up and drives.

Lorne is also driving, Stavros is in the back of an SUV. They come his grocery store HQ. Stavros tells him to keep it running. He pulls out the famous briefcase to fill it with money. Dmitri comes in and tries to explain that the exterminator said the bugs are the kind you buy at a pet store to feed a lizard. A fevered Stavros says god sent them. Dmitri says he called the pet stores and, as he's about to explain, Stavros says to just clean it up and then go with Cemenko who's taking him to keep him safe in the cabin.

In the hospital the doctor tells Molly that the hand was super-infected and he removed the foreign object, drained the fluid and removed the necrotic tissue so he won't lose the hand but it came close. She asks about the foreign object. He tells her a shotgun pellet that probably passed through something before it went into Lester's hand. Or someone, she muses. She wants to talk to him. He says he's sedated for now. The doctor tells her Ida is there and had her baby, named her Bernadette.

Molly goes to Lester's house and lets herself in with the spare key. Which is under the mat. She regards the Vern bloodstain. She heads to the basement and look around. She looks at the back of the washer. She undoes the plate on the back and but doesn't find anything.

Stavros and Lorne are back on the move, they discuss the Romans. Lorne says Romans were raised by wolves, who hunt and kill. Which is why he never bought into ""The Jungle Book."" He tells a story about a girlfriend of a friend who jokingly let the guy's dog hump her and the guy had to shoot the dog to get him off her. He says to the Romans there are no saints, no men turning water into wine, only animals who know breakfast and dinner. Lorne pulls into Stavros's estate and his headlights flash on Gus who is standing on the street. Blinded, Gus doesn't see who's driving. Lorne asks what time to pick him up. Stavros says they're done. He pays him what he owes him and says he has to hit the road in the morning. Lorne say he's sorry it didn't work out.

Gus gets a call from Molly. They start talking and he starts advancing his conundrum about seeing Lorne on the street that day. He says he can't figure it out so he's going back the next day. As they talk, Lorne drives up behind him in the SUV with its lights off. Molly says she is thinking of taking a drive in the morning to look at Lester's car and proposes meeting up after and comparing notes. He agrees. He walks into his house and Lorne watches to see which place he goes in as he listens to the police scanner.

The man from across the way from Gus's knocks on Lorne's window and says he isn't supposed to be there. Lorne disagrees. The guy says he's neighborhood watch and if he doesn't leave he'll call the cops. The guy says he knows he's trouble and says he's going to call the cops. Lorne makes an anti-Semitic remarks. (The man is apparently some kind of rabbi or spiritual leader and has a van out front marked ""Mitzvah Tank."") And then Lorne threateningly talks about the lack of alarms on second floors. He tells the guy to have a nice night and drives off.

The chief meets Molly at the hospital and the other cops are excited about Ida's baby. Molly goes in to see her and baby Bernadette. Ida asks how she's holding up. Molly points out that it's Ida who had a baby. Molly asks what she wants to know. Ida says she doesn't want the details just that Molly is taking care of it. Molly says she's trying. Ida says the name was Vern's idea and now he's dead, and jokes, ""that man always knew how to win an argument."" She tells Molly to get some rest.

Molly comes to see Lester, who is sleeping. She stares hard at his back. He is only pretending to be asleep. She leaves."

We open on a fish tank. One fish is scooped out by a chef and cleaned, breaded, and cooked. It is then served, complete with the head and tail to a group of men in the back of the restaurant. A man simply says ""Sam Hess."" He's told that Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers have been on the case for three days. Another man says they don't think it's business related and may be extra-marital and Wrench and Numbers are on their way to a second location to apprehend the culprit. The boss says he wants them dead.

In the locked pantry Don is talking to himself. Lorne opens the door and says it's time to make the call. Don wants to talk about how they're dividing the money and he wants to do it 60/40. Lorne doesn't respond. Lorne gives him the voice box changer and has him make the call He wants him to read ""word for word"" from a piece of paper.

Don calls Stavros, who is sitting in his office. He has a sweaty hand on the briefcase of money. He's remembering the day he found the money. Don reads the script about a boy who was poor and wanting and wondered why others had bounty and he did not. He tells Stavros where to meet him.

Don hangs up confused. Lorne asks him to hand him a duffle bag. He bends over and Lorne clocks Don and knocks him out.

Molly drives and listens to a weather report that says a historic blizzard is coming. Molly goes to see Gus at his place in Duluth. Gus sent Greta to a friend's house. He heard from his neighbor that Lorne was lurking outside the apartment building and he threatened him. He didn't call it in because he doesn't think the other cops will believe him. The neighbor got the plate number which traces back to Stavros' chain of grocery stores. He's not sure of the connection. Molly says they should drive over and check it out.

In the hospital a nurse visits Lester who says he's ready to go home and surprised to see a cop outside his door. The nurse can't explain it. Lester checks the window but it doesn't open. He gets back in bed and pretends to sleep. Chaz, his brother, visits and asks what he did. Lester says he cut his hand on a rusty nail. Chaz says he heard he was there when Vern was murdered. Lester says he wasn't there and he's a victim. Chaz thinks he's lying. Lester is offended. He asks him about the ""prank"" call about kidnapping. He says it was nothing and Chaz should be on his side as his brother. Chaz says people are dead, including Lester's own wife, and they're saying it's a conspiracy, that he hired someone. Lester swears he didn't do it. Chaz says if Lester wants it to go away Lester has to give the cops something. Lester asks Chaz to stand by him. Chaz says Lester's been a burden his whole life and he's done with him, there's something wrong with Lester, he's not right in the world. He walks out.

Lester looks at his roommate, whom the nurse said she would return for to take him to radiology in 10 minutes. His face is covered in bandages. Lester has an epiphany. He puts the man in his (Lester's) bed, takes the man's clothes and puts them in his bed. He covers his own face with bandages and gets in the man's bed. The nurse comes in and pulls the bed out with Lester in it. She leaves him in the hallway. He hops up, puts on the man's jacket, scarf and boots and takes off, leaving the bandages behind. He goes into the staff locker room, steals some car keys, finds the car with the remote opener in the lot and takes off.

Gus and Molly go to the grocery store. The snow is starting to get heavier. Molly tells him about Lester. Gus thinks maybe Lester and Malvo colluded. A cashier pages the manager. No one arrives. Molly leaves her card. They head out to get more coffee.

Stavros arrives for the meet on the top floor of a parking garage. The snow is coming down hard. He flashes back again to finding the money. He gets a call from Cemenko who says Stavros's son is getting restless. Stavros says he knows what he's got to do now and to come back in an hour and to tell his son he loves him.

Stavros leaves the parking lot. He tells the attendant that he changed his mind. God told him he has different plans. The guy is confused and just wants 2 dollars for the parking. Stavros says to open the gate, the Lord demands it.

Gus and Molly drive and he talks about how it bothers him that Lorne is so two-faced. She notes the murders. He says yes that is bad of course but it's tough since people like them are supposed to good, better than others even. She says it must be hard to live in this world if you believe that. He says she has no idea.

Don wakes, gagged and bound to some exercise equipment. Lorne cocks a shotgun and says he thought about it and the 60/40 thing doesn't work for him. He peers out the windows, which are covered in newspaper. Lorne tapes the shotgun in Don's hands and says in case Stavros calls the cops he wants to make sure they're too busy to respond, that's part one. He says part two is: ""Have you ever had Turkish delight? It's disgusting."" Don pulls the trigger and nothing happens. Lorne says it's okay, he'd be insulted if Don didn't try. Lorne goes to the window and starts shooting at random people. Don writhes and moans. Lorne hears the call for the shots fired on the police scanner.

Lester takes his stolen car back to his house. He heads to the basement and sees the washer has been moved. He takes down his fish poster and reaches into a hole in the wall and retrieves the hammer he killed Pearl with. He rifles through some file boxes and finds some glamour shots of his wife. He goes through a laundry basket and finds a pair of her underwear.

The nurse finally notices that the patient she thought she was taking to radiology is gone.

Lester heads to Chaz's house and lets himself in through the garage. He determines no one is home and busts into Chaz's gun cabinet. He leaves the hammer, the pictures, and the underwear. He's trying to frame his brother for Pearl's murder. He notices a photo of Chaz and his wife and son. He grabs a gun and makes sure it's empty. He goes into Gordon's room and sticks the gun in his backpack after thinking he's wiped it clean of prints. Kitty and Gordon return while he's upstairs. Lester tries to sneak out but Gordon sees him. He looks at him for a moment and then turns away. Lester leaves.

It is now snowing like crazy.

Gus tells Molly the rabbi's story about giving everything away. Gus says she might want to head back and beat the storm. She says she wants to stay and run things down. Gus admits he didn't grow up thinking he'd be a cop. He wanted to be a mailman. He likes that you get to see the same people every day, bring them presents, checks and be a part of the community. But the USPS wasn't hiring so he went with the police. Some cops go racing by. Gus wonders what that's about.

We switch to the police who are responding to the call of shots where Lorne was firing. Lt. Schmidt is leading the charge, calling for the perp or perps to come out of the house or they will start blasting. The cops advance. Lorne is listening to this as he drives away. The cops approach the house and trip a wire set up to have the rifle Lorne left fire more shots. The police light up the house. Don tries to dodge the incoming bullets. They stop firing and enter the house. They open the door and see Don with the gun and shoot before asking questions. They shoot a lot. Don dies. His gun, of course, was not even loaded.

Lorne drives in the snow and hears ""suspect is down"" and turns off the police scanner. Two cars approach and box him in forcing him to stop. Sideburns and Beard-- who we now know are named Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers-- get out of their cars and open fire on Lorne. Lorne runs off on foot as they keeps shooting after him.

A man hears the shots and sees Gus and Molly and tells them. Gus calls for backup and they head off.

Lorne gives Wrench and Numbers the slip in the near whiteout conditions. Lorne cuts his own hand to bleed as if he was hit by a shot and leave a blood trail for them to follow.

Gus and Molly arrive on the scene of the accident/ambush.

Wrench follows the blood trail and Lorne attacks him from behind stabbing him in the side and then cutting his throat. Wrench fired shots in the air while being attacked and Molly charges off towards the sound. Lorne grabs his gun and heads off into the snow. Gus and Molly find Wrench. Gus tells her he's dead but then can't see her in the snow and is clearly frightened that he can't see anything. He hears Molly in the distance ID-ing herself as a police officer and then hears shots. He sees a figure and yells her name and then shoots her by accident, not being able to tell who she was in the whiteout.

Cemenko drives Dmitri in the whiteout as the radio says to stay of the roads.

Stavros drives to the place he originally found the money and goes and buries the ransom in the same spot under the snow. He puts the ice scraper back on top of it. He looks to the skies as if for some divine sign.

Cemenko and Dmitri drive and the weather suddenly clears. Just as suddenly fish start falling out of the skies in the hundreds. The car skids off the road.

Something then hits Stavros car. Suddenly he's in the middle of the fish explosion. They are all over the road. He stops his car and sees Cemenko and Dmitri dead from the accident. He bursts into tears and cries to the skies ""I gave it back!""

Lester sneaks his way back into the hospital. He sits on his bed, thinking. A little smile plays on his face."

We open on Gus sitting in the hospital waiting room, tortured.

Over this we hear Chaz, Kitty, and Gordo eating breakfast. We cut to that. They're watching the news and see the crazy news about the fish falling from the sky on the highway during the storm. Gordo grabs his backpack, in which Lester put the gun, and heads for the school bus. Gordo heads to school and his friends are fooling around in the cafeteria and the gun falls out of his bag in front of all the other kids. We cut to Kitty vacuuming and then hearing knock at the door. it's Bill and the police with a search warrant for the house.

Chaz is in the middle of telling a coworker a stripper story when he gets the call that Gordo has been arrested and runs out. He arrives home just as Bill uncovers his cache of weapons including his illegal automatic rifle and the hammer, pictures, and panties Lester planted. Kitty starts freaking out and spits at him, and the cops have to hold her back. Chaz is in shock.

Bill calls Lester down to the station for questioning. Bill says he doesn't even know where to start with this mess. He explains all that he found and asks if Chaz was having an affair with Pearl. Lester says he was. He pretends to be upset and says he doesn't want to talk about it. Bill remembers Lester telling him in 9th grade that he was going to marry Pearl. He adds that there were rumors that Pearl was a floozy and that Chaz has a temper and Lester goes right along with all of it. He says he heard them arguing in the basement and that Pearl was cutting Chaz off meanly and saying he wasn't half the man that Lester is and then he heard Chaz crack her on the head with a hammer and he went down and confronted him and Chaz said it was an accident. He starts acting choked up but tries to explain. He says Vern showed up and Chaz shot him. He says he wanted to say something but he was afraid. He weaves a compelling tale. He believes it himself practically. He says if not telling makes him guilty of something he wants Bill to throw the book at him because he loved pearl and she was his life. He walks out of the station unencumbered past a window where Chaz in a cell. Chaz yells at him, asking what he did.

We flashback to the storm and the confusion and Molly getting shot. We see her see Lorne. She tells him to freeze, that she's a police officer. A figure approaches from behind that we can't ID and she shoots him. Then she is shot by Gus.

We cut to the hospital and she wakes up and sees Greta who is visiting with her dad. Gus sends Greta out of the room. Molly asks if they got Malvo, she says she had him until this other fellow showed up. She asks how the guy she shot is. He's in the ICU upstairs. Gus confesses that it was him that shot her. She says that doesn't make sense. He says he couldn't see anything but he says that's no excuse for what he did. He says she lost her spleen and he'll get her a new one. She says he'd better. He says he will confess at the inquiry even though they'll take his badge, but that's likely for the best. She says she could've just as easily shot him. He says he's been messing up from the beginning. She tells him enough of that. Lou, her dad shows up. She notes they both have bullet holes now. He flicks on the TV and they watch the hockey game. He notes she put down a guy with an assault rifle with a touch of pride. She says he was pointing it at her. He takes her hand and says he's proud.

Lester arrives home, very pleased with himself. He regards Vern's blood on the floor. He gets out the phone book and calls a cleaning service whose slogan is ""No job too tough!' The guy hangs up when he hears ""there's a lot of blood.""

Lorne reports in to the man at Rundle Realty, the front for their mercenary operation. He notes that two guys came after him in Duluth. And he says he has two questions; Did you tell these boys where to find me? And who do I talk to in Fargo about this? The man says he can't answer that but he knows that no matter what, it's not personal about Lorne. Lorne says that's not an answer. He points at the two phones on the desk and says one calls an ambulance and one calls a hearse. He asks again who he should talk to in Fargo. He walks out the front door and behind him he hears a woman scream.

Molly goes to see Mr. Wrench, the deaf one, in the ICU. He writes on a pad. ""Partner?"" She says he's dead. She asks if he can speak. He writes that he's deaf. She asks if he reads lips. He says yes. She says she's the one who shot him and wonders if he remembers her from the insurance company and asks if he was looking for Malvo. He doesn't answer but writhes in pain. She says her injury hurts too. She says she's never shot anyone before but gathers it wasn't his first time. She notes he's got a dad somewhere just like her and she wonders what the point is, his friend is dead and he's going to spend the rest of his life in jail and for what? He turns away from her. She leaves his room. His eyes well up with tears for Mr. Numbers.

Chaz sits in jail. A cop comes to get him and he tries to convince him that he's being framed. Chaz is out of his mind calling this a nightmare. He's being moved until the trial, or he makes bail.

Lester reports to work. He says he's ready to work and can work late even though no one is waiting for him. The boss says he was about to call the widow Hess since her claim was denied since Sam stopped paying the policy. She's going to be mad. Lester says he'll take care of it since she can't yell at him given his recent tragedies. The boss says he can call but Lester says he'll give her a shoulder to cry on.

Gus comes to see Molly with flowers, who's doing an evidence wall on her hospital window with all the players and the moving parts. They can't really figure out who Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers are/were. She actually figures out pretty close to what happened: Hess is killed and has ties to organized crime and sent the two guys to find out why. Lester met Lorne at the hospital, put the two guys onto Lorne. So they figure that Lester knew Lorne was in Duluth. They figure that is some kind of ammunition. Lou comes to pick up Molly to take her home. Gus is sad to see her go. She tells him to keep his head up because they're winning this thing.

We cut to Fargo, ND where the big bosses are. They head into a meeting and two FBI guys, (awesomely played by Key & Peele) are watching them from a car. They argue about fast food in the car. Lorne walks right by their car, pulls out an automatic rifle, goes into the office where the bosses just walked and wreaks carnage on all inside. We don't see it but we watch the camera pan across and up the building and hear what's happening. We see flashes against the window, glass crack, and blood spatter the windows. He kills everyone in his path on his way up to the top floor to kill all the main men. He shoots one man out the window and the Feds finally notice something is happening. They decide to pretend like they just arrived. The police arrive. They have nothing to say. Lorne walks away from the building unscathed as they head in.

Lester shows up at the home of the widow Hess who thinks she's in for a big payday. She's in a robe that shows her boobs. He says she looks nice. She calls him sweet. The boys are not home. They have a drink. They toast to fresh beginnings. She asks if the money is all set. He says there are a few more hoops to jump through. She says she's going to get it though right? He says that's where a skilled guy like him comes in and it's all about knowing which palms to grease if she gets his drift. She says she knows about greasy palms. He proposes another drink. They end up doing it. He bangs her from behind looking at a picture of Sam and remembering him bullying him. They band so hard the picture falls off the wall and then he climaxes.

Lou drives a sleeping Molly home. But first they stop at the police station in Bemidji. No one's there. The desk sgt. says everyone is out celebrating that they got who shot the chief. She tells the tale about Chaz. Molly has trouble believing this. She asks where Bill is. Molly wants to go to the bar where they're celebrating. She heads out into the snowy parking lot and starts to hyperventilate realizing what Lester did."

A deliveryman brings Lester a new one.

Lester is sitting with Kitty at the dinner table. She can't believe Chaz cheated on her. She says Gordo is having trouble sleeping and offers Lester some of Chaz' hunting gear if he's interested. Lester tells her about the new washer.

Lester packs up all of Pearl's things and leaves it on the curb for the trash pick-up.

Molly drops by the diner for coffee. Lou shows her that more flowers have arrived from Gus. He asks about her strategy presenting the case against Lester to Bill.

Molly has Bill meet her in the staff room. He compliments her police work and admits he was wrong. But she tells him they still have the wrong guy, that Chaz doesn't make any sense. He cuts her off and says they need to leave it alone. The Hess case is being handled by a slow-witted deputy and Molly asks Bill if she can take it over. Molly becomes animated but Bill tells her ""it's not meant to be.""

A furious Gina storms into Lester's office with the boys and demands to know why her claim has been denied. She thinks he knew about it before they had sex and gives him until the end of the day to come up with her two million. She has the boys try to intimidate Lester, who promptly staples both of them in the face. The Hess family leaves in a huff.

In Fargo, agents Budge and Pepper attempt to explain what happened to a superior. They are brought to a file room and told it is where they now work. Pepper tapes a grainy picture of Malvo to the wall.

The guard outside Mr. Wrench's room goes to the bathroom. Malvo is waiting in one of the stalls and proceeds to strangle him with a belt. Wrench wakens to find Malvo sitting by his bed. Malvo tells him he was the one who killed Mr. Numbers, along with his employer Mr. Tripoli. Malvo compliments Wrench on getting so close, tells him that if he wants to continue their conversation to look him up, and leaves Wrench the key to his handcuffs.

At the diner Ida asks Molly about her suitor. She thanks Molly for catching the guy who killed Vern. Molly starts to say she's not convinced they have the right man, but thinks better of it. In the parking lot Molly glances at the case notes that are in her trunk. She then walks to Lester's office and glares at him through the window.

Sitting alone in his car at a speed trap Gus calls Molly. He tells her he has his hearing the following day on the shooting. She advises him not to tell them she was the one he shot. The two make plans to go to an upcoming logging festival together.

ONE YEAR LATER

Gus is now a mailman and we watch him on his route. He comes home for dinner and we see that he's married to Molly and she's pregnant. Upstairs Molly looks at a wall and it's clear she hasn't yet given up on the case. She calls the FBI to follow-up on calls she's made about the massacre. She thinks she knows who was responsible but the agent doesn't seem interested.

Budge and Pepper are still working in the file room. Budge accidentally knocks a bulletin board off the room and they both stare at the photo of Malvo.

Bill introduces Molly to a teenage foster child, Tahir, from Sudan he and his wife have taken in. Tahir's family was killed and he was the only survivor. Tahir's documents, money and luggage was stolem when he first arrived in Minnesota and the story if how he was reunited with Bill and his wife is a remarkable one.

While lying in bed late one night watching TV, Molly talks (mostly to herself) about how they have everything they need.

We cut to Lester winning an Insurance Salesman of the Year award in Vegas. During his speech he thanks new wife Linda, who is one of his co-workers. He talks to the crowd about what he's learned over the past year. After the ceremony Linda goes to sleep and Lester stays up for a nightcap. Lester orders a drink and makes eye contact with an attractive woman at one of the tables.

On the other side of the room Lester spots Malvo, now a blond, sitting at a table with some friends."

We open inside a man's mouth while a dentist works on it. We pull back to see Lorne is that dentist.

Apparently, in the year time jump he has moved on and is now working as a dentist in Kansas City, Mo. He has become close with another dentist in the practice and has asked the hygienist Gemma to marry him. He and Gemma go to a party with the other dentist and it's clear that the two couples have become friends. At the party, the other dentist notes that Lorne-- going by another name and sporting a new, all grey, much more flattering haircut-- would get along well with his brother. It turns out his brother is in witness protection but the other dentist says to hell with it and will introduce Lorne to him on a trip next week to Las Vegas.

Which brings us to the moment that Lester saw him in Vegas. He approaches Lorne at the table. Lorne pretends not to know him but Lester presses the issue. Lorne and his party finally get up to go-- and Lorne says to him ""walk away""-- but Lester can't let it go and tracks them to the elevator. Echoing their original meeting Lorne asks Lester if this is really what he wants yes or no: Lester now full of brio says yes. Lorne pulls out a gun and shoots his fiancé, the other dentist, and his wife right in front of Lester. He hits the elevator button to a service floor and asks Lester for his help to drag the bodies out. Lester whacks Lorne in the head with his Salesman of the Year trophy and takes off.

He runs and wakes up his wife, tells her to pack a bag and that it's time to get going. They head back to Bemidji. As they drive home she talks about how she always had a crush on him and how she once dreamed a man would come take her away from the drudgery of running a motel with her parents and he did. She's worried they left Vegas because of her. He says no and promises to make it up to her with another trip. She mentions Acapulco and he says they can go tonight. When they get home Lester looks out the windows for Lorne. He heads to the basement to get one of Chaz's guns that he inherited and tucks it into the back of his pants.

Meanwhile, in Fargo Budge and Pepper are still toiling away in the file room at the FBI. A man comes and asks for the Fargo Syndicate spree killing file. They want to know why. He says he's been getting calls about the case. They grab a post-it note with Molly's number from the guy and ask where Bemidji is.

In Bemidji, Lou, Greta, Gus, and Molly have breakfast and Lou notes Molly did well for herself with her new family. She gets a call from Vegas P.D. asking her to speak to a witness to a shooting in an elevator at a casino: Lester.

Molly shows up just as Lester has tucked away the gun. She explains why she's there. He tries to put her off but she claims she has to pee and comes in. They sit down and Lester lies and says he was a witness to nothing on the elevator and his wife covers for him saying it was her that wanted to leave early. Molly says she's getting some security footage from Vegas so not to leave town.

Gus is out on his mail route when a red BMW drives by. It catches his eye peripherally. Lorne is driving but,since he looks different, and saw him just for a moment, he doesn't make the connection right away.

Lorne goes to Lester's old house but he no longer lives there. As he's leaving he makes sure to say in front of the new owner's children that people were murdered in the house. The guy directs him to Lester's new insurance practice. Lorne drives by but it is closed.

Molly leaves Lester's and gets a call that the two FBI guys are headed to her dad's coffee shop to meet her.

Lorne is already there. He stops in for decaf and pie and to see if he can get Lester's new address out of Lou. He pegs Lou as a former cop. They have a very cryptic conversation in which Lou once again brings up the massacre he saw in Sioux Falls. Lorne notices Molly and Gus's wedding photo. Lou offers to give Lorne's number to Lester the next time he comes in but Lorne declines saying he's only passing through and wanted to surprise him.

The second he walks out the front door, Molly walks in the back. As Lorne's car pulls away Budge and Pepper pull up. They are excited that Molly may know who the Fargo Syndicate spree shooter was, noting they have a personal investment since they were there that day.

Molly takes them to the precinct and shows them her whiteboard of evidence and timelines. Bill comes in and is angry and tells the guys not to bother with her. They point out that they will indeed bother because Molly has done great work. They say they'll spend the night and go work Lester again in the morning. Bill sputters and Molly walks away trying not to seem too triumphant.

Gus goes into the room in his house where Molly has a similar whiteboard up. As he looks at it he remember the car driving by and slows it down in his memory, now realizing he saw Lorne for sure.

Lester meanwhile is printing out his one way boarding passes to Acapulco. He lies to his wife that Molly said it was okay for them to go but they have to go pick up their passports at his office. They drive over, Lester parks some distance away and then asks his wife to put on his coat, put up its hood, and go to the office to fetch the passports and money from the safe. He watches as she enters, turns on the light, goes to the safe and gets shot in the back of the head by Lorne. He watches as Lorne turns her body over and realizes it's not him. Lorne heads out front, lights a cigarette and walks away."

We pick up right where we left off with Lester in his car hyperventilating having just seen his wife shot. He calmly goes into his office and to the safe and takes out their passports and some cash. He flashes back to Lorne in the elevator asking if this is what he wants.

He puts their house and car keys in her hands. He heads to Lou's coffee shop and says his wife will be along presently but she had to get something at the office and he orders her a grilled cheese. He claims he has to use the bathroom and sneaks out the back and calls the police about shots fired. He goes back to the diner and again notes his wife will be along soon. Lou says he already said that. He also tells him that a man was in there looking for him earlier. Lester flashes back to putting the boarding passes to Acapulco in his coat pocket which his dead wife is now wearing. For a split second you can tell he's pondering going back to get them but suddenly police cars go screaming by. Lou notes nothing good will come of that. Lester agrees.

Molly, Gus, and Greta are watching ""Deal or No Deal"" when she gets the call that the second Mrs. Nygaard is now dead.

At Lester's shop, Bill explains what happened without getting too close to the body or the blood that makes him ill. Molly notes that she is wearing Lester's coat so just maybe she wasn't the intended target. Lester busts in pretending to be all upset and freaks out at the sight of the body. Molly wants to ask him some questions and wonders if this is connected to Las Vegas, a repercussion for what he saw. He realizes they are suspecting him and again he freaks out that his wife is dead and says he's going to be sick.

He asks if he can say goodbye. Bill says yes. He goes over to the body and attempts to snag the boarding passes but Molly notes it's an active crime scene and he can't touch the body and leads him away.

Lorne is holed up in a cabin when he hears on the police radio about the murder and Lester being picked up. He grabs some weapons and heads out.

The FBI guys are waiting in the Bemidji precinct and one asks the other if they are dreaming. Molly tells them about the plane tickets in Linda's pocket. Bill gives the coroner's report of one shot to the head. Lou shows up to tell Molly about the man coming into the diner. She shows him the security photos of Lorne and he says it could be him, but notes he changed his look. Bill comes by and says they're going to question Lester. Molly says she has to go. Lou notes that she doesn't. She tells him to call Gus for her and tell him it's going to be an all-nighter. He says he'll do one better and go over there and stand guard with a shotgun to protect his granddaughter. She tells him he's a good man.

Lorne arrives at the precinct. He jimmies open the FBI guys' car door and grabs a small black book out of the glove compartment.

Bill, Molly, Pepper, and Budge go to question Lester. They show him pictures of Malvo and he says he is not going to talk without a lawyer and he has arrangements to make for his wife. He says to lock him up or let him leave. Molly tries to appeal to him saying Lorne is not going to stop and Lester has to know it because a man like that might not even be a man.

Gus awakes to find Lou on his porch. Lou fills him in. Gus says he's going to Molly and asks Lou to watch over Greta. Lou says he will.

Molly briefs the other cops on how they're going to fan out to try and catch him. The FBI is sending in backup and Pepper and Budge will babysit Lester at his house. Gus calls and asks her to promise not to go after Malvo because he can't take Greta to another funeral. She notes it's her job and she is obviously itching to do it. He asks again saying he knows it's unfair to ask. She promises to stay at the precinct and coordinate from there.

After he hangs up with Molly, Gus is stopped short by a wolf in the road. The wolf wanders off and Gus watches. His eye lands on a red BMW in front of a cabin. He knows Malvo was driving a red BMW. He pulls off to the side of the road and approaches the house. As he does so, Malvo gets in his car and drives away. Instead of calling the police or Molly, Gus enters the house.

Molly goes to Bill and tells him the plan of trying to draw Malvo out by using Lester as bait and that the FBI is sending back up. A pensive Bill tells her he's quitting after this, he doesn't have the stomach for it anymore. He says he was not meant to contemplate the nature of life. She tries to persuade him a little bit but he notes that he's going to recommend her to be chief and that he knows Vern was behind her too. He says he hopes after she has the baby she will come back. She says she'll think about it. She tells him to keep his chin up.

Malvo calls the Bemidji precinct pretending to be FBI to get the agent's names. He then calls the FBI and pretends to be Budge, using the passcodes he stole from the small book he stole from their car, and says they've reached a dead end and calls off the back-up.

Malvo goes to a used car lot and asks to test drive an old car that looks exactly like an undercover FBI car. The dealer, the young man with the pregnant wife to whom Lester tried to sell insurance in the pilot, calls shotgun.

Pepper and Budge drive Lester home. On the way he solves the fox, cabbage, rabbit riddle. (Row the rabbit over since the fox won't eat the cabbage. Go back and get the fox but take the rabbit back. Leave the rabbit but take the cabbage back since the fox won't eat the cabbage. Go back and get the rabbit.) Lorne follows them. At home, Lester goes through the box of Chazz's hunting gear in the basement.

Back at Gus's, Greta brings Lou a cup of coffee. He talks about his time as a state cop. She asks if he ever stood guard like this before. He says once, in 1979, when Molly was four. She asks if the person came. He says it was less a who than a what and that it eventually did come. Greta goes back into the house and grabs her BB gun. He asks what she plans to do. She says she'll put the guys eye out and Lou can take care of the rest.

Molly is clearly restless and bored back at the precinct as the other cops check in with no news. She grabs her coat and tells the desk sergeant that she's going to Lester's house. The sergeant wonders if she's safe alone. Molly tells her to lock the door.

Lorne's dummy car approaches Lester's house. Pepper and Budge think it might be their back-up. They get out and asks the driver to step out. When no one does they draw their weapons and approach. They see that it is not Lorne behind the wheel but the dealer he bought the car from with his hands taped to the wheel. Lorne approaches them from behind and shoots them both dead. He looks at the guy in the car who begs him not to kill him since he has a child.

Molly drives.

Lester is upstairs wildly pulling clothes out of the suitcases they had packed for their trip. He pulls out his Salesman of the Year trophy and tosses it on the floor with the clothes. He heads back downstairs and sees that the doors are open on the FBI car and there are blood red tracks in the driveway in the snow. He races back upstairs and calls the police begging them to hurry. Lorne hears the call as he approaches and hears Lester say that the bathroom door doesn't lock. As he walks across the clothes-strewn floor however, his leg is caught in a bear trap, which Lester recovered from Chaz's gear. They take shots at each other and Lorne throws Lester's trophy at him and beans him in the nose. Lester dives into the bathroom. After a beat he heads out and sees Lorne is gone, having wrenched his leg out of the trap.

Lorne heads back to the cabin and tends to his messed up leg, quite expertly. When he has splinted it we see Gus approach from the side with his gun drawn. Gus says to him that he figured out his riddle about the shades of green. Lorne congratulates him. Gus then shoots him several times. Lorne is still moving, however, so Gus shoots him again and again. He is unsettled but Lorne is dead. He reaches over and grabs Lorne's knife.

Molly rolls up to the cabin. She and Gus embrace. He leads her inside and shows her the body. He points to a briefcase and tells her to open it. Inside are all of Lorne's tapes. She grabs the one marked Lester Nygaard and plays it and hears the call where Lester confessed to killing his wife.

An onscreen title tells us its Two Weeks Later.

We see Lester tooling along on a snowmobile at Glacier National Park in Montana. As he heads back he spies a phalanx of police waiting for him. He turns tail and the police give chase. Lester crashes his snowmobile. He begins running, right past a sign that says ""Danger: Thin Ice."" The police try to call him back but he doesn't listen. Cracks start to spider through the ice until suddenly a hole opens up and Lester drops through, leaving his hat floating atop the slushy water.

Molly, Greta, and Gus sit on the couch watching ""Deal or No Deal."" Molly doesn't share the news of her call. Gus tell her he's getting a citation for bravery. He says it should be her. She says, nope, that's his deal. She notes, with contentment, that she gets to be chief.

And that's a wrap on the first season of ""Fargo."""

The detective on the case, Brian Boone [Bill Mondy], chalks it up to drug and gang activity because of the tattoo on Zack's neck [anyone who has seen the Blade movies will immediately recognize the tattoo as the sign of a vampire's familiar], but Krista maintains that Zack was not in a gang and decides to conduct her own investigation. Krista steals Zack's police file and learns that he and Danny Milano were previously arrested together. She confronts Danny, who provides no information but does drop a vial containing some druglike substance that Krista pockets. She googles glyphs until she finds the one on Zack's neck; the description directs her to Professor Melvin Caylo. Caylo identifies the stuff in the vial as Hominus nocturna (vampire) ash, worth thousands of dollars on the street. Kids use it for the vampire powers it gives them for a few hours. He identifies the glyph as the mark of a familiar belonging to the House of Chthon.

Vampires? There are no such things, Krista tells herself. On her way home, her car is rear-ended. When she gets out of her car to check on the other driver, someone steals her car. Then a voice whispers to her from inside a building, saying that he knows who killed her brother. When she follows the voice, she is attacked by two vampires. Fortunately, Blade [Sticky Fingaz] jumps in to ash the vampires after having followed Krista ever since he saw her snooping in Zack's apartment. Krista's disbelief in vampires is now a bit shaken, but she returns to the professor who tells her about Blade, the vampire hunter. Krista decides that she wants to get in touch with Blade, so the professor gives her Blade's only known address. When Krista goes snooping there, Blade confronts her again. He advises her to leave town before the vampires get her, but Krista refuses. She wants to hunt down the killer of her brother, and she won't leave. So Blade takes her in his confidence.

Blade has also been following the doings of Marcus Van Sciver [Neil Jackson], a high-profile developer who has been pumping his energy and money into redevelopment of historic buildings in Detroit. Sciver was pointed out to Blade as a member of the Vampire House of Chthon, and Blade wants to know where Chthon is located and what Sciver is up to. When Blade learns that Sciver will be present at an opening for the Sciver House Art Gallery, he asks Krista to attend the opening and plant a transponder on Sciver.

Krista is dolled up and looking fine (and in voice contact with Blade) when she walks into the reception room at Sciver Gallery. She attempts to plant the transponder on Sciver but he is too protected by his current girlfriend Chase [Jessica Gower] and his bodyguard Fritz. Instead, Krista introduces herself to Sciver as ""Katherine,"" but he recognizes her immediately as Krista Starr, sister of Zachary. Krista escapes to her car and has an earphone delivered to Sciver so as to communicate with him. Sciver admits that he killed her brother; Zack was nosing around too much for a familiar, he says. Krista aims a sniper rifle at his head, but Sciver keeps moving and ducking behind humans. Concerned that Krista has screwed up, Blade hops on his motorcycle and heads over to the gallery. Unfortunately, before Blade can get there or Krista can fire a bullet, Chase sneaks up on Krista and captures her.

Sciver takes Krista to the House of Chthon. Without permission from the elders to create a new vampire, he injects his blood into Krista. Now, all she has to do is to die, so he tosses her off a 15-story building. Krista awakens several hours later to find herself in a bodybag in the morgue. She rips it open and runs outside where she is met by Fritz and Sciver, who take her back to the House to sleep it off. The next night, Chase is ordered to take Krista out and show her the ropes. Chase shows Krista how to find the safehouses of Chthon, warns her to stay away from House of Leichen, and takes her to the Chthon abbatoir for her first drink of blood.

Meanwhile, Blade is searching for Krista. He wants to find her before she accomplishes her first kill so that he can inject her with the same serum that helps him deal with his own blood thirst. First stop is to talk with Danny Milano. Just before Blade eliminates him, Danny gives him the name of a cop, Detective Brian Boone, who might know where to find Krista. Blade hides a transponder on Boone's car and follows him to the abbatoir. Turns out that Boone is a familiar who has a deal with the vampires. He picks up prostitutes, robs them, and then gives them to the vampires for food. Unfortunately for Boone, Sciver is displeased with him and gives him to Krista for her first kill.

So what has Sciver and the House of Chthon been up to? They're researching a vaccine that they hope will render vampires immune to the effects of garlic and silver. So far, it hasn't been successful. All the vampires on whom they have tested it end up ashing when sprayed with garlic. When Blade shows up at the abbatoir, Fritz begs Sciver to inject him with the newest serum so that he can fight Blade. Sciver is reluctant but agrees. This time it works. Blade is surprised when his silver bullets don't stop Fritz. Shen [Nelson Lee], Whistler's replacement, who is waiting outside, helps out by emitting a high frequency hum that hurts everyone's ears. Sciver calls Fritz off, and Chase and Krista attack Blade. Blade stabs Chase with a silver stake, putting her out of action. Shen emits a second round of high frequency whine, allowing Blade to hold Krista down long enough to inject her with his serum.

Blade drives off on his motorcycle with Shen following. Weakened from his fight with Fritz, Blade has a hard time staying on his cycle and eventually falls off. Shen picks him up. Krista goes back to her apartment. She tries jumping from her window to a distant rooftop and finds that she has the power. The serum is making her think more clearly. She goes to the cemetery to visit her brother's grave. Blade meets her there. He explains how the serum works and invites Krista to work with him, just like her brother was doing."

Krista has returned to House Chthon to spy on Marcus van Sciver for Blade. She keeps herself lucid with injections of Blade's serum, which she keeps hidden in her shower drain. Blade and Shen are worried that Fritz is a new kind of vampire who is impervious to garlic and silver, so Blade has asked his friend, the Reverend Carlyle who works with ashers (kids that are addicted to vampire ash) for anything he might know about Fritz. Reverend Carlyle suggests that Blade talk with an ash dealer named Cain.

Meanwhile at House Chthon, Winston Haup from the Prague office has arrived to evaluate Sciver's vaccine, which they are now calling ""Aurora."" Marcus informs Winston that they are moving Project Aurora operations to the west coast and that several test subjects are currently being transported there. One of the subjects is Detective Brian Boone. Sealed in an airtight bag, Boone's body is in the back of an American Butcher truck on its way through Rapid City, South Dakota, when Boone suddenly regains consciousness. He pulls out one of his fangs, uses it to cut open the airtight bag, and escapes.

While Krista and Marcus dine at the Lotus restaurant and Blade attempts to beat information about Cain from an asher, Cain has followed Winston on his way back to the airport. When Winston makes a stop at Mina's to sample some American cuisine (an honor student plucked off a beach in Cancun), Cain kills Winston's driver. When Winston returns to the car, Cain ashes him and delivers his remains to the ash lab. When Marcus gets word that Winston missed his flight and that the tracking device on his car went dead outside of Mina's, Marcus and Chase pay Mina a visit, and Marcus shuts down her business by ripping out her heart. Marcus does not think Winston was taken by Blade. He would also have come for Mina and her clientele, Marcus reasons, so he has Chase grab a young asher named Shari and torture her until she reveals who was involved in Winston's disappearance.

Blade has gotten word to Krista asking her to find out about Fritz. Krista waits for a time when she's alone with Fritz and gets him to tell her about Project Aurora. She then asks Marcus to inject her with the vaccine, but he refuses. Partly to remove Fritz from a possible confrontation with Blade and partly because the board in Prague wants proof of Aurora's success, Marcus arranges to send Fritz to Prague, something that doesn't make Fritz very happy, as he wants another chance to finish off Blade.

Chase is successful in getting Cain's name and location from Shari. She puts together a team to make a hit on Cain's lab. Blade hasn't been successful in getting information out of the asher, so Blade has had him dumped on the side of a road, figuring that he will run straight to Cain to warn him. Blade figured correctly, and now Blade also plans to make a hit on the lab. When Chase's team, which includes Krista, gets to the ash lab, they find it abandoned save for the asher, who is bound and gagged and tied to a chair. As one of the team members starts to rip the duct tape from the asher's mouth, Krista realizes that it is a trap. She and Chase manage to jump to safety just as the duct tape is removed, revealing a bomb stuffed into the asher's mouth and set to detonate when the tape is removed.

Just after the bomb explodes, Blade enters the lab. As he prepares to destroy Chase, a car suddenly breaks through the door, knocking Blade to the ground. Fritz hops out and confronts Blade. ""Let's finish this,"" Fritz growls, and he and Blade go at it. When Blade knocks Fritz to the ground, Chase picks up her machine gun and open fires on Blade. Chase orders Krista to kill him, but Krista grabs a ""Caution: Hard Hat Area"" sign and uses it to whack off Fritz's head. Krista then falls on a broken post that goes right through her abdomen, back to front. Marcus has Krista taken to a hospital while Blade returns to Shen to have the dozens of bullets removed from his body.

Meanwhile, somewhere in Kansas, a state trooper comes upon a car with South Dakota plates seemingly abandoned at the side the road. She finds a man's body in the back seat and calls for the coroner and a tow truck. Then she hears screams coming from the trunk. She opens it to find a women inside. As she calls for an ambulance, the trooper is suddenly attacked by the man from the back seat. He turns out to be Detective Brian Boone."

However, in the recap shots at the beginning of Descent, Chase specifically orders Krista to kill ""Fritz"".]

FBI Agent Ray Collins [Larry Poindexter] arrives at the scene of the Kansas state trooper's murder. Watching the patrol video, he sees a man biting the trooper's neck. Next to the car, he finds a fang. When he is alerted to the American Butcher incident in South Dakota, he begins to wonder whether there might be some connection and starts asking questions.

Krista is beginning to heal, helped by Marcus rubbing a bit of his own blood into the wound. When Krista is well enough to pay a nostalgic visit to her mother, she finds Blade waiting in a car outside the house. Blade warns Krista not to maintain ties with people from her human life lest Marcus catches on. He then asks her what she's learned about Fritz, and Krista tells him about the Aurora Project. Blade charges Krista with getting a sample of the vaccine. She tries several times to get into the lab where the Aurora vaccine is stored, but each time she is interrupted by Cress, one of Marcus's guards.

Marcus sends Krista on an errand to deliver a satchel to a woman named Vanessa. Marcus doesn't tell Krista what's in the bag, and Krista doesn't peek, much to Chase's disappointment because Chase doesn't like or trust Krista. Still, Marcus has charged Chase with grooming Krista and teaching her the ropes. So, the next night Chase takes Krista on a public kill. They pose as two members at an AA meeting where they meet two guys -- Theo and Chuck -- ""the dregs no one will miss."" Chase lures them into an alley where she drinks from Theo and kills Chuck by breaking his neck. Krista is saved from having to drink Chuck's blood when two other guys pass by and ask if they are all right.

Meanwhile, Blade has gotten a lead on a disfigured vampire named Sands who may have been one of Marcus's failed experiments. He tracks Sands to a casino and pulls from him the location of the experimental lab. Blade, Sands, and Shen break into the lab, but it looks deserted. Suddenly, they are attacked by a half-dozen or so vampire goons. Blade manages to destroy them all. In the rubble and ash that remains, Blade finds a scalpel with 10A06-PA67-8 engraved on the handle. Tracing the number on the Internet, Shen tracks it to the medical practice of Dr Jeffrey Vonner and Associates. When Blade crashes Vonner's office, however, he only finds a bunch of pregnant women.

A visit to the South Dakota crime lab has turned up some interesting findings for Agent Collins. The remains in the back of the American Butchers truck has turned out to be human ash. Prints found on the cab window have been identified as those of Detective Brian Boone. When Collins holds the vial containing the fang up to a window to take a better look, the fang suddenly disintegrates into ash. What is going on here?"

The screams of the patients and nursing staff bring security running, allowing Blade no time to get his hands on Vonner's files. Blade jumps out of a window and runs to his car. On the windshield, he finds a handwritten note that says, ""HEY THERE LITTLE MAN."" As Blade is trying to figure out its meaning, he is run over by a large, black, armored van. As he lay in the street stunned, four hooded goons carry him away. Shen caught the whole thing on his videocam and is now contemplating whether or not to initiate shutdown protocol.

While Shen looks for Blade, everyone else is looking for Brian Boone, the missing detective. Boone's picture is plastered all over the newspapers under the headline ""Killer Cop?"" Collins has teamed up with Boone's old partner, Detective Gibbs. Together, they search Boone's apartment, hoping to find a clue to his whereabouts. All they can find, however, is a book in German and another one entitled House of Armaya. Marcus has ordered Chase to take Krista to the House of Leichen in Oregon and have them put her through a ritual that will place her in mind contact with Boone. Although this is a dangerous and bloody procedure, Marcus is certain that Krista will be able to connect with her first kill, afterwhich she and Chase are ordered to find and eliminate him.

When Blade regains consciousness, he finds himself in chains and face-to-face with Reverend Carlyle. Carlyle explains that it was he who had Blade captured, because he doesn't like the fact that Blade is letting ash-makers go free. (Blade figures they kill vampires, so they're performing a public service.) When the four goons take off their hoods, Blade is surprised to see members of his old ""family,"" -- Steppin' Razor, Run Run, Bolt, and Jaws -- collectively known as the Bad Bloods, all vampires now because Blade fed on them when they took him in as the scrawny little kid they called ""Little Man."" They didn't know that he was a bloodsucker. Turned by Blade the Daywalker, the Bad Bloods have been unable to find acceptance in any of the vampire houses, and they see Blade as their ticket in.

Before Krista leaves for Oregon, she pays a visit to Blade's hideout, an abandoned factory called Woodworks, where she learns from Shen that Blade has been taken off the street by four hooded vampires. Krista assures Shen that Marcus had nothing to do with it and tells him about Boone. She asks Shen what he knows about the House of Leichen. Shen warns her not to go through with the ritual, then announces that he's about to torch Woodworks. ""What happens to me?"" Krista wonders. ""We all got problems,"" is Shen's reply. He sets Krista up with a bagful of serum and goes back to listening to his videocam. With her superhearing, Krista can pick up the muffled conversation and hears the words ""Bad Blood,"" which seems to ring a bell with Shen.

Meanwhile, Blade is getting more and more hungry without his serum. Carlyle tries to convince Blade that the Bad Bloods are trying to stop killing and that they just need some of his serum. Blade knows better. ""They don't want my serum,"" he tells Carlyle. ""They want me. And now that they've got me, you're just their next meal."" True to Blade's prediction, the Bad Bloods run a stake through Carlyle's chest and feed on him. Their real plan is to gain entrance to the House of Chthon by delivering Blade to Marcus.

Shen has been doing a little online research about the Bad Bloods and found that there was a fifth brother, Jermaine Turner, who was shot and paralyzed. He locates Turner at a soup kitchen in a park and asks him where to find the Bad Bloods. He then returns to Woodworks, loads up on weapons and serum, and heads to the warehouse where Blade is being held. As the Bad Bloods drag Blade to the truck in order to deliver him to Marcus, Shen blasts a hole in the ceiling and starts shooting. He manages to ash one of the Bad Bloods as well as shoot several vials of serum into Blade. Unfortunately, Steppin' Razor leaps at Shen and knocks him to the floor, possibly breaking Shen's arm. Blade quickly regains his strength and ashes two more of the Bad Bloods, leaving him one-on-one with Razor. Razor decides to cut his losses and runs. By the time Marcus arrives to pick up Blade, the only thing left is a note from Blade that says, ""Suck me.""

As Collins pages through the books found in Boone's apartment, Gibbs brings in a box filled with all of Boone's open files from the past three months. Amongst the files for runaways, prostitutes, and pushers, Collins notices the file for Zachary Starr. Attached to the file is a picture of a female army sergeant who has also come up missing. Collins thinks it might be wise to find and talk to her.

Krista and Chase have arrived at House of Leichen, where Krista is introduced to Dr Miranda Berganza, who informs her that the first step in the vision process will be to place her on dialysis in order to clean the ""stink"" from her blood. She then meets Frederick, who is introduced as Chase's ex-husband and who will be Krista's guide through the ritual. Frederick explains that the process works because both Krista and her first kill (Boone) are linked because of their shared death experiences. What the ritual will do is to step up Krista's sensory awareness to the point where she can tune into Boone's energy and be able to know his whereabouts at any time. He warns her that she will come out of this ritual with extreme blood thirst and that she must be careful not to drink too much or Boone's energy will take over her soul. ""It's already lost,"" is Krista's reply.

As the ritual begins, Krista approaches a large blood bath. She drops her robe and slowly steps into the bath. Deeper and deeper she enters until her entire body and finally her face slip under the blood."

After she has had a chance to clean herself off and secretly shoot herself with the serum, Krista is informed by Frederick that it took her five hours to seek her vision whereas the longest emersion time for any other vampire has been 27 minutes. It is Frederick's conclusion that Krista rejected the connection because either a) she doesn't want Boone found, or b) she is rejecting the vampire world. Krista makes up a story about once having a relationship with Boone. Frederick buys her story but, after Krista has left the room, he notices one of her serum vials on the floor.

When Marcus hears that Boone is headed for Silvan, he realizes that Boone may be headed there to request an audience with the pureblood vampire Damek, head of the House of Armaya. Since Marcus has been testing his vaccine on Armayans and fears that Boone will spill the beans, he orders Chase and Krista to follow him to Silvan and eliminate him.

Meanwhile, Blade has been lurking outside the church where Dr Vonner's funeral is being held on the chance that he might catch a glimpse of someone or something. It's daytime so, of course, Marcus doesn't show. However, Blade notices a young pregnant girl. From the blue glow in her abdomen, Blade is certain that the child is not human. Shen identifies the girl as Vanessa Simms, a single, boyfriendless, low-paid, waitress-type who watches movies on a $9000+ plasma TV. Blade and Shen conclude that she may be being paid to carry a vampire baby, so Blade decides to follow her.

Boone has made it to the House of Armaya and requested audience with Damek, but Damek's goons are giving him a hard time until Boone reveals that he knows who is responsible for ""disappearing"" Armayans. Just as the goons are about to lead Boone to Damek, Chase and Krista break into the garage and start shooting. Krista goes after Boone, but he grabs Patricia Barton, a human woman that he kidnapped as a present for Damek. Boone attempts to waylay Krista by ripping open Patricia's neck. As Krista fights the urge to drink Patricia's blood, Chase corners Boone in the rest room and ashes him through the door. Thinking they have eliminated Boone, Krista and Chase return to House Chthon, not realizing that they ashed a goon, not Boone.

Marcus is having his own problems. One of the pureblood board members from Prague has decided to make a surprise visit to House Chthon in order to check on the Aurora Project. The diminutive Charlotte, accompanied by her hulking bodyguard Thorne, is concerned that a full-scale war will break out with the Armayans unless the Chthons can strike first and in daylight. Marcus assures her that Aurora will work and that he will step up development. What Marcus doesn't know is that Charlotte is suspicious of him and has ordered a covert, full-scale audit of the House of Chthon.

Blade has learned through his contacts that a girl fitting the description of Vanessa Simms has just arrived in Berlin. When Krista stops by Woodworks for more serum, she informs Blade that Chase has been sent to Berlin. Blade decides that he should go to Berlin, too, but he first reminds Krista of the importance of her getting a sample of the Aurora vaccine.

Back in a Louisiana hospital, Collins is speaking with the physician who is attending Patricia Barton after she was found wandering on a roadside with her larynx torn open. He tells Collins that Patricia muttered something about a soldier woman helping her. Collins shows Patricia a picture of a vampire from the book he found in Boone's apartment, and Patricia's blood pressure shoots to the ceiling while she points at the fangs.

Once in Berlin, Blade is directed to the Melinger Klinik where Vanessa is being drugged and kept chained to a bed and watched over by Chase. Seeing that the Klinik is heavily guarded, Blade kills one of the guards and gains entry through a back door. He plants a bomb set to detonate in four minutes then goes in search of Vanessa, eliminating a few goons along the way. When Chase sees that Vanessa is missing, she runs after them, but Blade and Vanessa make it outside with only seven seconds to spare. Unable to go out into the sun, Chase hangs back. Suddenly, the Melinger Klinik explodes into flames.

Trying to find a way to get her hands on the Aurora vaccine, Krista has just realized that she might be able to reach the lab by crawling through the tunnels under the House of Chthon, which started life as the Hotel Matador. She locates a book about the hotel in Marcus's library, rips out a page detailing the complex of tunnels under the hotel, finds her entry and exit points, and begins her crawl. She successfully reaches the lab and obtains a vial of the vaccine.

On her way out of the tunnel, however, Krista is met by Marcus, who noticed the misplaced book in his library and figured out right away what was going on. Krista tells him that she wants the vaccine in order to get her old life back, but Marcus informs her that the vaccine doesn't work. ""Fritz would have started to deteriorate in a few more days,"" he tells her and confesses that the vaccine is really just a stepping stone to raise the House of Chthon to a position of power. Then he offers a choice to Krista. Either live with him or die in her old life. Krista offers him her hand."

When Vanessa says that she needs to use the restroom, Blade escorts her down the hall, but they are attacked by two snarling vampires. Realizing that Blade is protecting her, Vanessa helps by stabbing one of the vampires with Blade's silver knife. The vampire immediately turns into ash. Now willing to talk about Vonner, Vanessa says that he simply offered her money for being a surrogate mother for a childless couple. She knows nothing more.

Marcus and Krista are attending a showing at one of Marcus's art galleries when Krista meets up with her Uncle Pat. Pat first chews out Krista for not visiting with her mother then informs her that Lisa is sick and in the hospital. At the same time, Marcus receives a call informing him about Chase being badly burned in the explosion at the Klinik in Berlin. Marcus drags Krista away from her uncle, and they make it back to the house just as Chase's badly burned body is wheeled into their makeshift hospital. Chase barely manages to whisper ""Blade"" into Marcus's ear, as Marcus orders Krista to leave immediately for Berlin to locate and bring back Vanessa. On her way to the airport, Krista makes a short stop at the hospital to see her mother, but Lisa is asleep. Uncle Pat tells Krista that her mother has been diagnosed with leukemia and is going to need a bone marrow transplant. When he tells her that the marrow will have to come from her because he isn't a match, Krista refuses. Uncle Pat accuses her of using drugs, and Krista walks away.

After being transfused with dozens of pints of blood, Chase is improving, however Marcus is in trouble with Charlotte. Charlotte wants to know what Chase was doing in Berlin, so Marcus tells her that Chase was attempting to retrieve a stolen ""asset."" Charlotte then informs Marcus that she has received a message from Damek, the leader of the Armayans. Damek has somehow learned that Marcus was using Armayans as guinea pigs and wants to meet. When Marcus, Charlotte, and her bodyguard Thorne arrive at the rendez-vous spot, Damek states his terms. He wants House Armaya be admitted to the governing body and forgiven for their attempts years ago to destroy the other houses. Furthermore, he wants this done by the end of the week or he will destroy House Chthon by revealing to the other houses the experiments they have been doing with Aurora, hoping to make Chthon the strongest house of all. As Damek backs away, Marcus asks how Damek learned of Aurora, and Damek produces Sands.

Blade and Vanessa have made it to Paris. Blade takes Vanessa to be seen by a doctor he trusts. The doctor performs a sonogram and is amazed to find that Vanessa's womb contains only fluid, so he suggests amniocentesis. However, before the doctor can set it up, Krista arrives, having been diverted to Paris on Marcus's order after he learned that Blade was there. Krista stands with Vanessa as the doctor performs a D&C, removing a liter or so of the bloody fluid. He cannot identify the contents but is certain that it is incubating some sort of ""biological substance."" Blade takes a sample of the fluid, and Krista takes the rest of the sample back to Marcus, but not before allowing Blade to gouge out her eye so that Marcus won't become suspicious. Vanessa is sent into hiding.

Meanwhile back in Silvan, Louisiana, Collins is searching the house where Boone stayed. He digs a bullet out of the woodwork and scrapes up some ash from the floor just as he gets a call from his superior, Mack Sorenson, ordering him to step down from the case and return to Kansas.

First to go is Detective Donny Flanigan, an ex-cop who befriended Blade when he was still little Eric Brooks, living at home with his father on pints of blood stolen from the blood bank. Flanigan is the person who first introduced Eric to Abraham Whistler. When the dispatch appears on Shen's computer screen that Flanigan was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at Garrity Gun Range, Blade and Shen hurry down to see. One look and Blade can tell that it wasn't self-inflicted. Flanigan's gunhand is broken, and there is a chess knight shoved in his mouth. The knight leads Blade to a second victim, Mr Taka, a sympathetic store-owner who taught young Eric to play chess. Blade and Shen drop in at Taka's house and find him in his kitchen with his neck slit. Blade fears that his childhood nurse, Viola Watkins might be next, so he has Shen do an internet search to determine her whereabouts.

It looks like her death is imminent, yet Lisa refuses to go to the hospital to die. Uncle Pat says that they must let Lisa go, but Krista has another idea. She breaks into Woodworks while Blade and Shen are away and steals several vials of serum.

Charlotte's snitch Glynnis has been unable to find anything incriminating on Marcus. Money for the Aurora Project has been laundered through his legitimate businesses, and there is no evidence of any unauthorized side projects. However, Glynnis has found out that the Aurora project has been shut down except for one facility outside of Reno, Nevada. Damek is continuing to send Armayans for experimentation, as per a deal with Charlotte, but all ingoing Armayans are destroyed soon after their arrival with no evidence of being used for experiments. Charlotte suspects Marcus may be using the Reno facility as theater in an attempt to either delay or distract them. Glynnis still has two investigators in the field, and she proposes to personally investigate Krista Starr more thoroughly. Charlotte approves of the plan as well as the human infant Glynnis has procured for Charlotte's dinner.

Shen has located Viola Watkins. She changed her name To Sally Porter in 1981 and now runs the Queen of Mercy Clinic. Shen and Blade hurry over, but they are too late. Razor has already been there.

She describes her killer to Blade, who immediately recognizes him as Razor. Then Viola drops a real bomb. He's on his way to kill Blade's father, she says. Blade is nonplussed. He saw his father die in 1977, shot by a hood who was trying to hold up Taka's market. No, says Viola. He didn't die, and he came back to Detroit two months ago.

Blade returns to the house where he grew up. It is dilapidated and abandoned, and his father is not there. But Razor IS. Blade and Razor have at each other. Suddenly, a sword is thrust through Blade and into Razor. Razor ashes, and Blade falls to his knees. He sees his father standing there. Robert attempts to make peace with his son [Eric ran away from home when he came to believe that his father was going to abandon him to Abraham Whistler], but Blade tells him to ""go to hell.""

Chase offers him $2 million over the asking price, but Taylor laughs in her face, so Chase returns to her hotel suite in defeat. Suddenly, there is a knock on her door. She opens it to find an old flame, a pureblood vampire named Alex, standing there with a bottle of wine and two glasses in hand. Alex wants to rekindle their relationship, even though Chase is merely a turnblood. Chase, who has been feeling uncomfortable with her position with Marcus ever since she botched the Berlin situation is only too ready to jump into bed with Alex...until Marcus catches them in flagrante delicto. Against Alex's wishes, Krista returns to Detroit with Marcus.

Trying to catch up with Krista's mother before daybreak, Blade, Shen, and Krista race over to her Uncle Pat's house, but it's too late. Lisa has been there and gone, and Pat is lying dead on the floor. Blade beheads him to make sure he stays that way. Lisa spends the next day in a storage locker, poring over pictures of Krista and snacking on a security guard. Come evening and with no idea where Lisa might be hiding, Blade suggests that they stakeout the cemetery where Krista's brother Zack is buried, until Krista remembers that her mother saw Krista being turned by Marcus in her ADE (After Death Experience). Krista feels certain that Lisa will try to find her through Marcus.

Meanwhile, Collins is obsessing over what transpired when he caught up with Krista at her mother's house. Collins remembers Pat telling him that Krista was hanging around with Marcus van Sciver, so he arranges a meeting with Marcus at his office at Van Sciver, Inc. As he sits in the reception area waiting to see Marcus, Collins watches a distraught woman (Lisa) enter the lobby, shouting for her daughter. Security leads her into a back office just as Krista comes in the front door. Fortunately, Krista recognizes Collins and ducks behind a pillar just as the security guards bring out her mother, bound and strapped to a gurney. Krista tries to follow, but Collins is looking in her direction, so she stays put as her mother is placed in an ambulance. When Collins is summoned by Marcus's secretary, he turns away. Krista runs outside, and she and Blade follow the ambulance in Blade's car.

Collins' audience with Marcus is not very productive. At first, Marcus denies knowing either Zack or Krista Starr. When Collins provides Pat's statement that Krista has been hanging with Marcus, Marcus concocts a story about how he is involved with Krista but that, because of his public position, he needs to maintain discretion. Marcus denies knowing how to reach Krista but does say he will have someone look into it and offers to meet Collins in a nearby park to exchange information. As Collins sits in the park, waiting for Marcus, he is met by his FBI superior, Mack Sorenson. Sorenson reveals that he has had a call from Marcus Van Sciver and that he has been ordered to relieve Collins from duty. After having his gun confiscated, Collins attempts to explain all that he has seen. When he starts to go on about a conspiracy and about Marcus not being human, Sorenson humors him and suggests that they return to headquarters.

Inside the ambulance, Lisa learns that she is not being taken to a hospital. She is, in fact, in a vehicle for the transportation and disposal of stray vampires. When the attendant draws up a big syringeful of garlic extract and prepares to inject it, Lisa breaks free of her restraints and attacks the attendant and then the driver. Right before Krista's eyes, the ambulance crashes and overturns. When Krista opens the ambulance doors, she sees her mother feeding. Blade and Krista take Lisa back to Woodworks where Krista injects her with several vials of serum, but it's not working. Shen concludes that Lisa has fed too many times and been vampire for too long for the serum to work. Lisa breaks loose of her binds and turns on Shen. With tears in her eyes, Krista destroys Lisa.

Alex has shown up at House Chthon offering to buy/rescue Chase for $2 million. Marcus does not put up a fight and, in fact, suggests that they three drink a toast to ""new beginnings."" When Alex next wakes up, he is strapped into a chair in Marcus's laboratory. Technicians are preparing to inject him with the Aurora vaccine. Chase explains that Alex is helping them to prove that the vaccine works and that even purebloods can be destroyed. Alex's body then disintegrates."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840801/?ref_=ttep_ep9,,Marcus seeks Krista's love and sympathy by showing her how he was turned into a vampire.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Félix Enríquez Alcalá'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Having just destroyed her own mother, Krista is drowning her sorrows drinking shots alone in a bar. Worried about Krista, Marcus has sent Chase out looking for her. Since Shen's friend Dr Chang has identified the Aurora vaccine as a ""keyhole"" virus, designed to target the specific DNA sequence of pureblood vampires, Blade and Shen are also looking for Krista so that they can question her about Marcus's intentions. Chase is the one who first finds Krista and brings her back to House Chthon. Drunk and filled with bitterness, Krista attacks Marcus, drawing his blood. Marcus wipes the blood off his cheek and smears it in Krista's mouth, causing her to have a vision of his own ADE.

It is 1899. Marcus and his wife Isabella have moved from London to Detroit and purchased a building with the intent of turning it into a store and making themselves a home. One day, as work to set the store in order before the opening, Marcus is visited by Damek and two of his goons. Damek demands that Marcus pay a weekly protection fee, but Marcus declines. The next day, Damek returns and again demands payment. When Marcus again refuses, Damek has his goons begin to destroy the store. Damek takes Isabella and drinks her blood, killing her. He then has Marcus nailed inside a coffin that they deliver to a tribe of vampire Indians who feed off Marcus until he begs for death.

Meanwhile, Shen gets an email from a street snitch who saw Krista picked up by Chase, so Blade heads over to House Chthon to see if he can find a way in. Blade and Shen enter through the sewers, following the same tunnels that Krista took to break into the laboratory and steal a sample of the Aurora vaccine. Unfortunately, they find that Marcus has had the tunnels sealed and shock-sensitive security alarms placed on them. Looking for another way in, Shen notices an IT Line and taps into the security cameras so that they can locate Krista's whereabouts in the house and follow her movements...until security disarms their taps.

Now that House Armaya has been reinstated, Damek has decided to place more demands on Marcus. He arranges for an audience with Marcus, during which he demands a piece of every one of Marcus's holdings. Marcus refuses. Fueled by memories of what Damek did 100 years ago to his wife, Marcus attacks Damek and ultimately destroys him.

FBI agent Ray Collins has agreed to return with Mack Sorenson to FBI headquarters and tell his story to the upper brass, that is, until he notices the mark of a vampire's familiar on Sorenson's arm. Collins whips Sorenson around and smashes his head through the car window. With nowhere to go, Collins runs to the house of his friend Jessica Ellis, the lab technician who provided him information about the findings in the Kansas and South Dakota incidents. When he tells his story to Jessica, she surprises him by agreeing with him that there is something unusual going on. She's been doing a little digging herself and gathered together files on other cases with similarities. Just after she copied and returned the files to the person who gave them to her, that person and everything about him disappeared. Collins is afraid that he is on his own, but Jessica says there may be someone who can help them. That someone is Blade.

Having seen Marcus's ADE, Krista has become more sympathetic to Marcus. When he is hurt in his fight with Damek, it is Krista who takes him to his bedroom and dresses his wounds. She kisses him and, before she knows it, they are making love to each other. What she doesn't know is that Blade is peeking in the window, watching."

When Jennifer next wakes up, she finds herself chained to a pole in front of a wall of TV screens and sees some guy in a white mask coming at her with a pincers. She can do nothing but scream.

After making love to Marcus, Krista is in turmoil, feeling the loneliness of being caught between two worlds. Instead of taking her next dose of serum, she smashes her remaining vials against the shower stall and goes feral. Before she can feed off anyone, however, Blade finds her and takes her to Woodworks. There, he injects her with serum and tosses her into a detox tank, informing her that, if the detox doesn't work, their partnership is over and she is ash. He then closes the door on her and lets her go cold turkey.

Back at the Blast, waitress Nicki is angry because Zed stiffed her again for his drinks and tips, so she goes looking for him in the back rooms. That's the last time anyone remembers seeing Nicki. Several days later, Nicki's sister Bethany meets with Shen and their mutual friend Daniel. Bethany has asked Daniel to help her find Nicki, and Daniel thinks Shen may be of service. At first, Shen doesn't want to get involved...until he sees a photograph of Nicki with someone's arm around her. On the wrist can clearly be seen the mark of a familiar. The odd thing is that it isn't a glyph from any of the known vampire houses. Blade recognizes it as the glyph of the White Prince, a rogue vampire attempting to start up his own following. While Shen researches the White Prince, Blade goes looking for the White Prince's familiar.

Worried because her snitch Glynnis hadn't returned from following Krista, Charlotte has come to the conclusion that Glynnis is dead and ordered Thorne to pick up Chase and bring her to New Orleans. Charlotte wants Chase to be her eyes and ears in House Chthon. When Chase returns to Chthon, she tells everything to Marcus. Marcus decides to let Chase run with it and offers to let her take to Charlotte, as proof of her intention to work as Charlotte's spy, a broken sword that he once took from Blade. Chase returns to New Orleans and presents the sword to Charlotte. ""Marcus first,"" Chase promises. ""Blade next."" Charlotte is happy with their arrangement.

While Krista continues to thrash around in Blade's makeshift detox tank, Blade returns with the news that he's found out where the White Prince's familiar hangs out, and it's the same club in which Nicki worked. Shen tells Blade what he's learned about the White Prince...he appears to show up every 19 years and may have been one and the same with the 15th century sadist Gilles de Rais, Garrick the Butcher in 16th century Germany, and the Red River man in Seattle in the early 1900s, all of them torturers and murderers. He wears a hood because he is said to have somehow disfigured his own face with silver. Concerned that the White Prince might disappear for another 19 years if he finds out that Blade is after him, Blade suggests they take a quieter approach, like sending in Bethany as a decoy.

Bethany is more than willing to pose as the decoy, so Shen wires her with a transponder. Shen and Bethany go into the Blast while Blade waits outside in the car watching the exit. When Bethany is approached by a guy who starts pawing her, Shen springs into action, taking swings at the guy, asking him where he took Nicki, and rolling up his cuffs in search of the familiar glyph. Unfortunately, there is no glyph, but the disturbance has given the White Prince's familiar enough time to connect with Bethany and whisk her away. Shen informs Blade that Bethany has disappeared, but Blade never saw her leave the club. Blade then notices that the transponder indicates Bethany is still inside.

Shen goes into the men's room to the blood off his hands. Kurt the bartender enters the room and begins to wash his hands, too. Shen notices the four bloody scratches on Kurt's arm and surmises that they may have been made by Bethany. Shen knocks Kurt against the wall and notices the White Prince's glyph on his other wrist. Hearing the commotion on his earphones, Blade decides it's time to make his entrance. He comes barreling into the club, and the patrons scatter in fear. He follows a trail of blood that leads through a toilet stall to a secret door. Blade busts through the door and, hearing screams, finds himself in the video room where a tape of Jennifer being tortured is playing. Blade rips out the tape and then goes in search of Shen.

The White Prince finds Blade first, and they beat on each other, breaking down doors until Blade is in the room where Shen is being held in chains. Using his foot, Blade breaks the chains, setting Shen free. As Blade and the White Prince continue their fight, Shen goes looking for Bethany. What he finds is ghastly...bloody bodies of girls, some still alive, Nicki and Bethany among them. Just as Shen is about to cut them free, he is jumped on by Kurt, but Shen manages to stab him with a straight-edge razor.

The fight between Blade and the White Prince has moved outside to the roof. When the White Prince tries to convince Blade that he is a specially-appointed seraphim, Blade retorts, ""You're nothing but another crazy-ass vampire."" The White Prince roars angrily and leaps at Blade. Another fight ensues. It ends when Blade rips off the White Prince's lower jaw and tosses his body outside into the light of the rising sun. The White Prince turns to ash even before his body hits the ground.

When Blade and Shen return to Woodworks, they discover that Krista has succeeded in breaking down the door into the detox room. They find her seated in a corner, apparently having made it through the withdrawal from blood thirst. As Krista picks up her things and prepares to leave, Blade reminds her that Marcus is soon going to make his move on the purebloods, and he wants Krista to find out when. Krista doesn't think Marcus trusts her enough to confide in her, so Blade orders her to make Marcus trust her."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0854443/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,Charlotte and Thorne suffer an air crash.

Somewhere over northern Michigan, their plane explodes, thanks to the bomb that Marcus had Chase deliver along with the sword she presented to Charlotte.

Blade and Shen are chilling in Woodworks when the security beeper goes off. Someone is attempting to break in. He has managed to pry the lock and open the door, but Blade coldcocks him before he gets very far. Shen paws through the guy's wallet and discovers that he is FBI Agent Ray Collins. Collins explains that he wants to join Blade in his hunt for vampires. Blade refuses, until he receives a hurried phone call from Krista informing him that Charlotte's plane went down. Blade wants to search the crash area for anything which might reveal the location of the conclave, but Shen says it may take hours, even days, to find it. Collins offers to get the location from the FBI's access to NAF Star 3 overflights, but only if Blade will agree let him tag along. Eventually, Blade relents. Once they have determined the location, Blade and Collins head north.

Marcus has his hands full with Tucker Moffot, the architect he has retained to make alterations on the ventilation system in the building in Toronto that he has acquired for the conclave. When Marcus ""negotiates"" with Tucker by breaking his assistant's neck, Tucker agrees to speed up the alterations in time for the conclave. Marcus assigns Cress to follow Tucker's every step.

Charlotte and Thorne, the only vampires to survive the crash, have had their strength restored by feeding on two campers. After walking most of the night, they have made it to the small town of Meadow Lake and taken refuge in the Emerson County Elementary and Junior High School where faculty and students are preparing for the annual pancake breakfast. When lead teacher Bobbie Lotink goes into the pantry to get more powdered sugar, she is surprised to find a wounded man lying on the floor. She bends over to tend to him and doesn't notice Charlotte hanging from the ceiling. When Charlotte leaps on her, it is already too late.

Hours later, when Blade and Collins make it to the school, they find everyone drained of blood. When Blade gets ready to behead the victims so that they don't turn, Collins hears a sound. Thinking there might be survivors, they go to search. Suddenly, they are attacked by Bobbie Lotink and another vampire. Blade ashes them both but not before Bobbie stabs Collins in the leg with a butcher knife. The cut has severed his femoral artery. Unable to continue on, Collins suggests that Blade keep looking for Charlotte while using himself as bait for the vampires who are soon to rise. Reluctantly, Blade gives Collins two ultraviolet bombs. After promising that he will destroy Collins if he falls prey, Blade mops up Collins' blood and drags the mop down the hall to attract the vampires then goes off in search of Charlotte and Thorne. The vampires begin to awaken and follow the trail of blood. When they have all entered the room in which Collins' is lying on the floor, he sets off the bombs and ashes the lot of them.

Meanwhile, Blade has found Thorne and Charlotte. Thorne manages to toss Charlotte out of Blade's way, then he does battle with Blade until Blade succeeds in ashing him. Dragging himself down the corridor, Collins looks up a staircase to see the diminutive Charlotte hiding there, looking for all the world like a scared 12-year old. ""I just want to find my daddy,"" she says, and Collins succumbs. Minutes later, Blade finds Collins lying on the stairs, his neck chewed up. He looks up to see Charlotte perched in a corner of the ceiling. Knowing she has nowhere to run, Charlotte offers Blade a deal. If he will allow her to get to the conclave, she will secure him a place in the family where he can find safe haven and hone his many skills. Blade appears to consider it for a moment, then he tosses a silver blade right into Charlotte's chest. Charlotte turns to ash. Turning to Collins, Blade promises to get him out of there, but Collins knows it's too late. He thanks Blade for allowing him to kill a few monsters, then makes Blade keep his promise to destroy him before he turns into one himself.

Back at House Chthon, Chase's jealousy of Krista has hit critical mass since she saw Krista wearing the necklace that Marcus years ago gave to his wife Isabella. When Krista comes out of the shower, she finds Chase in her room, sitting in a chair and waiting for her. After calling Krista a ""hollow little girl playing hollow little games,"" Chase warns Krista about needing her as a friend in the days to come, then she slinks out of the room.

Back at Woodworks, Shen has finally discovered the location of the conclave...Toronto."

Architect and contractor, Tucker Moffot, points out the new ventilation interface, large bore air-conditioning ducts, and doors that require laser confirmation of retinal identity. Marcus is pleased with the results. What pleases him more, however, is that Blade won't be dropping in unexpectedly. Marcus has discovered Blade's hideout and is sending Chase and her team to destroy it and Blade with it. On the flight back to Detroit, Krista ducks into the lavatory and phones Blade, warning him to get out.

But it's too late. As they speak, the lights in the Woodworks building suddenly go out. The ultraviolet lights kick in but then go out, too. Suddenly, Chase et al storm the building, machine guns ratatatting. Blade yells to Shen to blow up the lab. Shen manages to set the destructor but, before he can press ""execute,"" he is hit in the crossfire. As Chase drags Shen's body from the building, Blade hits ""execute"". A few seconds later, the entire place explodes.

When Shen awakens, he is in House Chthon, strapped into a chair, Chase taunting him with a tray of torture instruments laid out before him. However, Marcus wants Chase to leave immediately for Toronto in order to oversee the arrangments, so he leaves it up to Krista to apply the torture, assuming that she's had some experience with it during her stint in Iraq. With Shen's blessing, ""Just do it, you bloodsucking bitch,"" Krista pulls out a few of Shen's fingernails. She also slips a scalpel under his hand so that, when Marcus and Krista leave the room in order to catch the flight to Toronto, Shen is able to cut the straps that bind him and escape.

Contrary to the belief that Blade is dead, Blade is quite well, thank you. He assembles what remaining arms he can find in the rubble and prepares to leave for Toronto. It is Blade's desire to be there for the slaughter of the purebloods in order to make sure Marcus pulls it off. However, he first has a stop to make in order to get his ""key"" into the Conclave. ""Don't worry,"" he tells Turner Moffot as he wields a knife. ""I only need one."" Blade cuts out one of Turner's eyeballs. Then he takes Turner's car, picks up Shen, and they're off to Toronto.

At the Conclave in Toronto, Chase has taken over security and had the Aurora canisters installed. The purebloods have started to arrive. Unbeknown to anyone, Blade and Shen have also arrived. After making proper obiescence to Lord Rusk, Marcus retires to the waiting room while the purebloods talk amongst themselves. Chase presents Marcus with the button that will unleash the Aurora vaccine when he pushes it. Then comes the summons. The purebloods are ready for Marcus's address. And so it begins.

After subdued fanfare on Marcus's part and sighs of disgust on the parts of the purebloods, Lord Rusk tells Marcus, ""Just give us what you came to give us."" Marcus pulls the vial of Aurora from his pocket. ""Happily,"" he says and then smashes it in his hand. ""It never worked,"" Marcus admits, ""but don't worry, I've come to deliver what you really deserve."" Marcus pushes the button...and nothing happens. Lord Rusk stands up and addresses the other purebloods, apologizing for not telling them about Marcus's subterfuge. ""We thought it was important that Marcus reveal himself,"" Lord Rusk explains.

""We?"" asks a surprised Marcus.

Chase steps forward and spitefully tells Marcus, ""Charlotte gave me a simple choice...you or the House of Chthon. Much as I've grown to care for you, I thought it was more prudent to bet on the House.""

Meanwhile, Blade and Shen have broken into the security room and found that the lines to the Aurora canisters have been cut. Afraid it will take too long to re-establish the lines, Blade seizes one of the canisters of Aurora and races to the Conclave. All hell has broken loose, but Blade says simply, ""You can't have a party without the cake."" He tosses the canister into the air then shoots it. The canister explodes, the vaccine disperses, and the purebloods disintegrate.

Blade turns on Marcus in the Conclave, and Krista takes on Chase in the hallway. Krista succeeds in tossing Chase over the banister and watching her fall a dozen stories to the marble floor at the bottom. When she returns to the Conclave, she sees Blade standing over Marcus, poised to drive a sword through his chest. ""Blade!"" Krista screams. Blade looks up, and Marcus rolls away. Suddenly, Shen shows up shooting silver bullets. One of them hits Krista in the shoulder, but she immediately pulls it out. Marcus grabs Krista, and they both go barreling out a window. Fortunately, it is night.

Some days later, Marcus and Krista have returned to Detroit and are looking at the mess they made of Woodworks. Marcus knows that Blade will eventually turn up again in a new hiding place, and Krista warns Marcus that they will need to lay low themselves. Marcus reminds Krista that he still has the Aurora vaccine, so power over the purebloods is still in his hands. Krista asks Marcus how he learned the whereabouts of Blade's hideout, and Marcus tells her about intercepting and tracing a phone call. Suddenly, Marcus grabs Krista by the hair.

""How long have you been working for Blade?"" he growls."

She won't tell them who the father is, but we catch on when Ricky, fellow marching band member and drummer, tells Amy he won't forget that special night they spent together at band camp.

But Ricky has is own problems. His girlfriend, Adrian, is about to stand him up to go on an illicit date with the school football star, Jack. Jacks a devout Christian, just like his beautiful, virginal girlfriend, Grace Bowman, but he finds himself torn between his manly instincts and his promise to God and Grace.

Meanwhile, Ricky's also putting the moves on Grace (can't he just stick to one girl?). Apparently not, as we learn from a conversation he has with his shrink. But in that same conversation, he also reveals that he spent time in a foster home, thanks to his sexually abusive dad.

But Ricky doesn't know that Amy is pregnant. She doesn't know who to tell first, a doctor, or her parents. Before she has a chance to break the news to her family that their good girl is not so good, Ben calls to ask her out on a date. He's even joined the marching band just to get closer to Amy. She agrees to go with him to the Youth Fellowship post-game celebration (hosted by Grace of course). Meanwhile Ben's friends, Alice and Henry, notice that Ben moved beyond just trying to have sex with Amy. He's actually got a thing for her now. Too bad he doesn't know her big secret, though he does notice her looking at Ricky across the room. So do Lauren and Madison, unfortunately, and they put two and two together.

But where are Jack and Adrian during all this? Oh, just making out in the church hallway. Unfortunately, Tom, Grace's brother, walks in on them and screams. Grace and Ricky discover their two-timing significant others while Amy and Ben, oblivious to all, finish up their slow dance and the world falls apart around them."

Even Ricky can't get a date with Amy now; despite the fact she's carrying his baby. And Adrian? Well, she's always a safe bet for Ricky, even though we get the distinct sense he means a little bit more to her than she's letting on. Let's just hope he's not going to mess that one up.

Meanwhile, Jacks desperately pleading to win back Grace's love, thanks to his little judgment error: kissing Adrian in front of the whole school. Too bad- or good thing? Grace doesn't know what else happened, even if Jack did tell everybody in the whole locker room.

And Jack's not the only big mouth on campus. Thanks to Lauren and Madison's gossipy ways, the whole school knows that Amy and Ricky had one fateful night together at band camp. Of course, it inevitably gets back to Ben, and boy, is he upset. So is Amy, who starts giving her BFFs the silent treatment. But she eventually forgives them, as so often happens in girl world.

Speaking of the silent treatment, Grace can't seem to give Jack the cold shoulder for too long, even if her parents won't let her see him ever again. But maybe they have good reason- after all, he lies through his teeth when Grace asks about what happened between him and Adrian. Grace totally buys into the lie, and things are good between them- for now.

And as for the happy new couple, things are about to get a lot more serious, because Ben just dropped the L bomb. And he's even willing to overlook the whole Ricky thing. Amy's so smitten; she's almost forgotten there's another B bomb to come. Until next time."

To make matters worse, a close encounter of the gas station kind between potential grandmother Anne Dr. Jean Hightower reveals that Anne is still as clueless as ever. The rest of the town is not, however, thanks to the gossip mill.

Meanwhile, Ben is still working on planning the perfect first kiss with Amy, while Ricky is hatching a plan of his own. A selfless one, for once! He's going to help Grace sneak around behind her parents backs by pretending to date her, and then safely escort her into Jack's arms. But is it so selfless? Adrian doesn't seem to think so, but she'd never admit that she's actually jealous.

Later, at the fair, all the usual suspects are coupled up: Alice and Henry, Amy and Ben, and Grace and Jack. But when Ben tried to kiss Amy after the carousel, she gets a serious case of nausea and throws up all that food she just ate. Talk about ruining Ben's painstakingly planned moments. Looks like the only serious winner at the fair turns out to be Ricky, who score serious points with the Bowmans when he brings Grace home safe and sound from their date.

But Ben is not willing to give up his romantic vision yet. He shows up at Amy's house and executes that first kiss, flawlessly. All could be well in Amy's world, except now her sister Ashley has figured out she's pregnant and from the looks of it, there's a lot more drama to come before everybody gets to their (hopefully) happy endings."

Her mom, Anne Juergens (Molly Ringwald) comes in and, not noticing her in the dark kitchen, goes through the morning ritual of getting the coffeemaker started. Then she sees Amy sitting there silently, when she turns around to leave the kitchen. Startled, she asks Amy why she's sitting there, and why she didn't say anything. Amy blurts out that she's ""having a baby"", which she has to repeat several times. Still her mother doesn't quite believe her, thinking it has to be a prank or something. Amy's sister, Ashley Juergens (India Eisley) walks in on this and is eventually told to leave when Amy announces her intention of getting an abortion. Anne calls the school to excuse both of them from attending that day, and to excuse Amy from attending for the rest of the week. She lies and gives the reason as needing to go to Chicago because of a relative dying. Anne suggests sending Amy away to have the baby secretly. Ashley begs their mom to not let Amy leave, because if Amy leaves while their father is still gone, she doesn't know what she'll have left to call home anymore. Meanwhile Anne called her husband, George Juergens (Mark Derwin) and left him some message about Amy not feeling well, and she's expecting him to call her back. Instead George calls Amy directly, and asks her about it, to know if she's ok. Amy says she's fine and not to worry, that he doesn't need to come home or anything, and then changes the topic. She asks how he is, and he says he misses ""his girls"" [aka Ashley and Amy]. She then starts crying and says she thinks she needs to tell him something. But before she can, Anne takes the phone away and tell George, then she quickly hangs it up. Telling Amy that she thinks she shouldn't be calling anyone right now, she takes away her phone and leaves the room. Promising to return it someday.

Meanwhile, on a day that Amy doesn't show up at school, rumors circulate that she took off in order to ""take care"" of her problem."

Sheldon's carefree life as the boss's son comes crashing down in 1929.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Steven S. DeKnight'],"['', '', '']",[],"['superhero', 'superheroine', 'police', 'police car', 'police officer', 'male police officer', 'female police officer', 'terrorist', 'ambush', 'police officer shot', 'male police officer shot', 'police officer killed', 'female uniformed police officer', 'police shootout', 'dead female police officer', 'super villain', 'man killed']",[],"Three children play by a lake, one of them pretending to be the superhero Utopian and chasing after the other two, who are pretending to be Lady Liberty and Mr. Snow. They argue about whether the girl hit or missed with her laser eyes, and the girl Chloe unleashes a sonic scream blasting the two boys. Chloe's eyes glow as she insists that she didn't miss, and one boy boys run off. The other boy, Brandon Sampson, runs to Chloe and comforts her.

Brandon's father Utopian flies down and says that he heard them playing. He tells Young Chloe that they have their powers for a reason, and that she has to care about everything. Utopian tells Chloe that it's easy to get angry and hurt and even kill people: even the bad guys. He tells Chloe that they don't let the anger the best of them, and they live by service, compassion, and mercy. Brandon nods that he agrees, but Chloe says nothing.

As Utopian takes the two children off to get ice cream, he hears screams and sirens with his super hearing. He tells the children that he has to go because there are people in trouble that need him, and Brandon tells his father that it's okay. Utopian flies off, and Chloe and Brandon watch him go.

Now

An adult Brandon sits in a diner and watches the news on the TV. The newscaster mentions the trial of the villain Blackstar. Brandon hears sirens, and runs out when his waitress' back is turned. He dons his Paragon costume and flies off.

Men in ape masks--the Primate Crew--are robbing an armored car, gunning down any police that try to stop them. Iron Orchid steps forward, tells the robbers that she's robbing the armored car, causes her suit of armor to assemble around her, and blasts the lead robber with her wrist blasters.

The other two robbers flee or shot down by Iron Orchid, who then rips the door off of the armored car. Paragon flies down and tells Iron Orchid to surrender. She tells him that he's out of his league and advises him to fly away. Paragon charges forward and Iron Orchid blasts him.

Paragon is smashed into the lobby of a building, and Iron Orchid walks in after him and tells a nearby security guard to run. He does, and Iron Orchid advises Paragon to stay down. Paragon gets to his feet, and Utopian flies in and catches Iron Orchid's fist when she tries to punch Paragon. Utopian throws her into the ceiling, and she falls and hits the floor as Paragon tells his father that he had it under control.

Utopian tells Paragon that the rules are that Paragon calls for back up, and tells him to do better next time. The older hero tells Paragon that he's paying for the damage and flies off.

That night at the Sampson house, Utopian--Sheldon Sampson--sits on his bed, cover in old scars. He goes to the bathroom and washes up, and looks at himself in the mirror. The news is playing, and the newscaster mentions a new development in the trial of Dr. Bendal, aka Blackstar. Utopian is on the TV in the crowd as Blackstar's motion for dismissal is refused, and Blackstar yells at Utopian on the TV that they can't keep him locked up forever.

Sheldon turns off the laptop playing the news and then looks at a photo of himself, Lady Liberty, and the other superheroes of their group, the Union. He then looks at a photo of his younger self and his wife, Grace: Lady Liberty.

The next morning, Grace finds the garlic press that Sheldon is looking for in the kitchen. They kiss and Grace casually uses her super strength to pop the caps off of two beer bottles, then gives one to Sheldon. They talk about Elvis Presley in 1958,

They talk about their 20-year-old daughter, and Grace tells Sheldon that she won't listen to him. Sheldon says that their daughter is like an alien to him, and Grace admits that she has nothing else. Grace asks about Brandon, and Sheldon says that Brandon let the fight with Iron Orchid get out of hand and could have gotten himself or someone else. Sheldon figures that their son is too emotional and distracted, and may never be ready.

Brandon is sitting on the roof of the house, drinking and listening to his parents with his super hearing. His uncle Walter--Brainwave--joins Brandon and sits down with his nephew. Walter says that he heard what happened and asks Brandon if he wants to talk. Walter reads Brandon's thoughts about what Sheldon said about Brandon, pats him comfortingly on the shoulder, and says that they should go eat.

Brandon asks Walter what Sheldon was like when he was younger, before he got his powers. Walter says that nothing ever rattled Sheldon.

1929 Chicago

At the Sampson Steel Plant, Sheldon walks through the floor joking with his workers about his upcoming marriage. He reminds one of the workers, Fitz Small, to call him Sheldon rather than ""Mr. Sampson"", and Fitz's father Willie congratulates Shelton on his upcoming marriage.

Sheldon goes to his father, Chester who is arguing with Walter who wants to sink the deal they have and their investments on the stock market. Walter warns that their workers are overextended, and Chester says that they need someone who's ""glass half empty"" and Walter says that should give it a few months. His father and brother disagree, figuring that they need to expand their business. They insist that it's about family.

Now

The Sampsons sit down for Sunday dinner, and Sheldon insists that they say grace before eating. Chloe isn't there, and Sheldon says that they know now to wait for her because she doesn't join them. As Sheldon says grace, something slams into the house and they realize that Chloe has arrived. Chloe staggers in, drunk, and hugs Walter. She pours herself a glass of wine and joins hand with the others as Sheldon finishes grace. Walter and Chloe open their eyes and exchange smiles, and when Sheldon finishes Chloe sarcastically compliments her father on the meal.

As the family eats, Walter tells Chloe that he saw her magazine cover. Sheldon says that he saw it, to Chloe's surprise, and he says that it was a beautiful photo. Chloe puts down Brandon's superhero ""career"", and insists that she doesn't need powers to get attention. When she says that she didn't ask for her ""gifts, Sheldon angrily says that their gifts are for people less fortunate than them."" Chloe says that other people are more fortunate because they don't have Sheldon as their dad, and Grace tells her to apologize. She insincerely apologizes and says it's the last dinner she's coming to, grabs the wine bottle, and leaves.

Walter jokingly says that Chloe took the wine, Brendan goes outside after Chloe and asks why she talks to their father like that. Chloe tells her brother that of course he sticks up for Sheldon, and she wonders why Brandon stays there when he says that he was raised the same way. Brandon says that someone has to be the next Utopian, and Utopian stands for something. Chloe says that Utopian is a myth, and Sheldon knows that he should have been there for them when they were younger. But he won't admit it because it's not the ideal.

As Chloe walks away, Brandon says that someone still has to stand for something. His sister tells him that no one live up to the ""great"" Utopian, not even Shelton. Brandon tells her that she's jealous, and Chloe insists that she's not jealous, just sorry that Brandon has to put up with it because he thinks their father will love Brandon. She says that Brandon doesn't and flies off.

In the kitchen, Sheldon and Grace are washing dishes. Walter comes in and sarcastically says that there's such a thing as dishwasher, and Shelton tell his brother that he likes washing dishes. Grace lets Walter dry and leaves, and the brothers talk about Brandon. Walter says that Brandon idolizes Sheldon, and he has a lot of potential. Sheldon says that a lot of kids have had potential and failed, and Walter suggests they go out and get some beer.

Brandon goes to a club with his friend Barry aka Tectonic. People take photos of them, and Brandon basks in the publicity. When Brandon says that they shouldn't be in it for the self-endorsement, Barry sarcastically wonders if Brandon brought Shelton along with him. Brandon says that he has training in the morning, and Barry asks him to have one shot with him because he hasn't seen him in months. Barry tells him that nothing will live up to Sheldon's standards. They both agree that it wasn't their fault they were born into their powers when the older members of the Union had to suffer to get theirs.

Brandon says that he's not giving up, and Barry tells him to look at everything that he's missed out to impress Shelton, and it hasn't gotten Brandon anything. He tells Brandon that he wants him to be the next Utopian, but Brandon can't put his life on hold.

1929

Sheldon sees his fiancée, Jane, to her car. After she leaves, George Hutchence walks up and greets his friend Sheldon. People run by, panicking, and one man tells them that the stock market collapsed and tells them to get their money out of any bank they have it in. Will and George to into the Sampson office building, where Walter is working with their accountants. Walter says that the market is collapsing, and Sheldon notices that their father isn't there.

Sheldon goes out on the roof and finds Chester there at the edge. Chester talks about how Sampson steel runs through all the buildings in NYC, and talks about building a legacy is just building a box. He tells Shelton go on down, and tell them that he'll be right down. As Sheldon turns to go, Chester gets up and walks off the ledge, falling to his death.

Now

Sheldon and Walter enter the Union's HQ and look at the meeting table, and Walter remembers that the team was last there in the 60s, before Skyfox turned on them. Sheldon bring up holograms of the Union members and wonders why Skyfox betrayed them, and Walter insists that Skyfox was a terrorist and took the Vice President hostage.

The brothers sit down and Sheldon wonders what they have to show for 90 years of fighting villains. Walter says that they've made a difference, but Sheldon says that the country has never been more divided. His brother tells him that it doesn't have to be that way if they took a more active role, and Sheldon says that it's against the Code, and that they only inspire.

Walter says that he regrets not having done more in World War II, and Sheldon tells him that dictating social and economic policy would never end... and who would stop them. When Sheldon says that it would be the end of free will, Walter tells him that some would say that free will is bringing the world to its knees. He tells his brother that evil is more black-and-white. He asks Sheldon if it feels representative, and asks him if putting away bad guys is making the world a safer place.

A wheelchair-bound Fitz--the Flare--comes in with his daughter Flare II and says that Blackstar is loose in Nebraska after escaping the Supermax where he was imprisoned.

Later, Ruby Red joins Briggs in Nebraska. Briggs tells her that the Union is fighting Blackstar nearby, and he's hanging back because all he has is flaming fists while Blackstar has an anti-matter heart. When Ruby asks if Paragon is there, Briggs--Flaming Fist--says that he is and that he heard she and Paragon were a thing. Ruby tells Flaming Fist that they split up a few weeks ago, and he asks what she's doing later.

Utopian and Lady Liberty are smashed back into the two younger heroes, and they take cover. Blackstar arrives and smashes Lady Liberty down, and Utopian beats Blackstar while Ruby goes to the unconscious Lady Liberty. Utopian uses his heat vision on Blackstar, who shrugs it off and throws Utopian away.

Blackstar advances on Ruby and the unconscious Lady Liberty, and Ruby armors up. Paragon and the Union members arrive, and Brainwave tells Paragon to stick to the mission. Blackstar knocks Paragon away, and the other heroes attack him. Brainwave manages to mentally paralyze Blackstar, and Tectonic shoots a seismic wave at Blackstar. Phase Out teleports around Blackstar and punches him, and he manages to grab her and fires an anti-matter blast from his chest, burning away her body and killing Tectonic and Flaming Fist.

Furious, Paragon renews his attack and Blackstar slams him to the ground. Lady Liberty recovers and grabs Blackstar as the villain smashes Paragon away. Utopian flies up, and he and his wife grabs Blackstar. Brainwave tries to enter Blackstar's mind, while Blackstar knocks Lady Liberty into Brainwave and starts beating Utopian repeatedly.

Paragon recovers and sees his father being beaten. Brainwave separates Blackstar's mind from his physical body, and puts the villain's mind in a ""psychic painting"" of a beach. In the physical world, the heroes beat Blackstar. In the painting, Blackstar manages to grab the mental projection of Brainwave despite the latter's mental control of the painting, and punches him.

In the physical world, Blackstar blasts the heroes back. Utopian recovers and flies back at Blackstar, who flies into the air and punches Utopian to the ground and slams down on his chest. Blackstar starts to ""go nuclear"", emitting vast amounts of radiation. Paragon remembers his father saying that he might never be ready, flies forward, and smashes Blackstar's skull in.

Utopian asks what's wrong with Paragon, and insists that heroes don't kill. His father tells him that he took the easy away out, and Paragon yells at him saying it wasn't easy. Lady Liberty tells her husband to hold back, and Utopian tells Paragon to go back to the Union HQ. Paragon flies off, and Utopian tells Lady Liberty that their son took a life after everything they've taught him. Before she can speak, Brainwave tells them that they have a problem as he mentally contacts the Supermax.

Later at the Union base, the real Blackstar is brought in and looks at his dead duplicate. Utopian and the others are there, and Utopian tells Blackstar that the duplicate appears to be Blackstar."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10619746/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"Brandon and Chloe clash with their dad after the Blackstar incident. In 1929, Sheldon confronts a reporter over an exposé on the family business.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Steven S. DeKnight'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Blackstar puts on his glasses and asks who collapsed his duplicate's skull. Paragon says that he did, and Blackstar chuckles and tells the assembled heroes that someone is screwing with them. Blackstar tells them that the clone is a cheap knockoff, and Paragon challenges him to fight. Utopian tells his son to stand down, and Blackstar says that Paragon should be locked up as murderer. Paragon orders Blackstar taken back to Supermax, and Blackstar yells that Utopian is a hypocrite, and that his fan club will spread the news.

Flare II points out that the clone never said anything, and Brainwave says that they're going to need to cut open the clone to get answers on its origin.

Later, protesters gather at the HQ. Paragon, Lady Liberty, and Brainwave and the Flares give a press conference. A reporter asks where Paragon is, and Lady Liberty says that he's in an after-action debrief. Lady Liberty tells the press that Paragon wishes to express his regret that someone's life was lost despite the circumstances. The reporter asks if their old-fashioned Code is endangering public safety, and Utopian says that force without due process isn't justice.

At the farm, Sheldon finds Brandon hitting cans with a rock using his super-strength. Sheldon says that he knows it hasn't been easy for Brandon being his son, but everything Brandon does is a reflection on the family. Brandon points out that Chloe didn't show up at the battle, is drunk or stoned half the time, but Sheldon is complaining about Brandon.

Sheldon tells his son to be better, and Brandon reminds him that he had to make choice between Blackstar and Sheldon. Brandon says that he chose his father, and would choose him every time. He asks Sheldon if he would do the same, and Sheldon tells his son that one day he will be Utopian and the only thing Brandon will have to guide him is the Code. Sheldon insists that the Code has to stand, and that killing is never the answer. He says that there's always another way to get the job done, and tells Brandon to stay on the farm until things quiet down. Brandon tells him that it's bullshit, but finally says that he understands.

1929

Sheldon arrives at the plant office with Chester's suit for the funeral, even though it's closed casket. Walter says that Chester hated the tie, and only wore it all the time because Sheldon gave it to him. He then tells his brother that he spoke with the board and they want to shut all the steel plants down. Sheldon says that they have to talk to them, and refuses to put their workers out of jobs.

Willie and his son Fitz come in, and Fitz shows Sheldon a newspaper with a photo of Chester's corpse and the headline ""The Death of Capitalism"". There's an article with it that says Chester ripped off his workers.

Sheldon goes to the newspaper and demands to talk to the reporter who wrote the story, ""G Kennedy"" Grace comes out and introduces herself, and says that the story is double-referenced and all true. When Sheldon says that Chester was his father, Grace expresses her condolences and Sheldon yells at the staff that capitalism made their business and their homes. He asks Grace what she contributes, and asks her how she's helping America. Grace points out that Sheldon's nose is bleeding, and he tells them that they should be ashamed of themselves and storms out.

Now

Fitz finds his daughter Petra in the Union conference room. She asks if he ever lost anybody on the Union when he was a superhero. He says that he didn't, and Petra admits that she was afraid during the battle with Blackstar. Fitz asks if she fought through the fear, and Petra says that she isn't Fitz and she can't keep fighting when the supervillains are going crazy and wonders if her teammates dying is just the start of it. Petra doesn't know if she can keep being a superhero when things are insane, and Fitz tells her not to. He tells his daughter that he never asked her to follow him as a superhero, and he was worried that Petra would get herself hurt bad like he did. The wheelchair-bound man tells Petra that he couldn't be prouder of her, for being better than him in so many ways.

The next day, Sheldon goes to Chloe's apartment to see her. He's brought bagels and daughter lets him in, they talk about Chloe's upcoming shoot, and she wonders why Sheldon is there. Sheldon asks his daughter if she's coming to the funeral, and assures her that he wants her there. He figures that Brandon will listen to Chloe, before he listens to Shelton or Grace, and admits that he can't get through to his son.

Chloe advises Sheldon to give Brandon some time to deal with Barry's death, and Sheldon realizes that she's talking about Tectonic. Chloe says that he could never stop being Utopian to be a father to her and Brandon, and the suit and cape are the ""real"" Sheldon. She tells Sheldon that he's been attacking her for so long that she doesn't know how to do anything with him but fight back.

Sheldon says that they're bigger than squabbling, and Chloe tells him that the only way to stop is for one of them to stop being themselves. Her father insists that he's not trying to attack her, then starts to leave. Sheldon asks Chloe if she's going to make it to the funeral, and it would mean a lot to him, and Chloe says that she doesn't know.

Walt agrees with him, but Sheldon says that they don't govern and don't kill, and that's the Code.

In the Union Hall, Walt is sitting and in telepathic communication with Raikou. Sheldon comes in. As Sheldon hugs his brother, glad to see him alive, in the mindscape Raikou says that she knows Walt cloned Blackstar and made it look like Skyfox was behind it, and that Walt found a way to release Blackstar from his cell, knowing only Utopian and Paragon would be available to come there when Blackstar broke out.

Raikou figures that Walt wants to split Utopian apart from his son, which creates instability in the Union... which will force new leadership. Walt tells Raikou that the country is spiraling out of control because of Sheldon's attitude, and there's no one else to blame.

Yakko meets and endears himself to the alien leader (a giant toe) by grooming it. When the Warners end up gaining control of the ship, they make it fly all over the place erratically. Eventually the aliens get exasperated and deposit the Warners back in their cabin where the giant toe is waiting to be groomed some more.

Inspired by the Orson Welles ""War of the Worlds"" radio drama, Brain stages a similar hoax on television, hoping to cause a nationwide panic. He pretends to be a newscaster while Pinky pretends to be an alien, using video cameras to create the illusion that they are human-sized.

With sets built from cardboard, Brain frantically reports on the alien invasion as Pinky destroys everything around him. Pinky messes up by wrecking part of his costume, but the audience seems to be enthralled by the performance anyway. The hoax is successfully broadcast, but much to Brain's dismay, the audience finds it funny instead of scary."

Via voiceover we learn that he's been stranded here for five years and has transformed himself into something completely different during that time. His plan is to ""bring justice to those who have poisoned my city."" His name is Oliver Queen.

A news report tells us that Queen had been missing and presumed dead for five years. He is the son of billionaire Robert Queen, who was killed during the shipwreck. The younger Queen had been a notorious playboy before the accident.

Queen is reunited with mother Moira and brought back to his castle-like residence. He isn't too thrilled with seeing his father's former business partner Walter Steele, though he's overjoyed at the sight of his younger sister, Thea.

We see a young attorney named Laurel Lance working at a legal aide office. She is working on the case of Adam Hunt, a corporate financier who has swindled hundreds of people out of their homes. Laurel's sister, Sarah, was killed in Queen's shipwreck and she turns off the news report in the office.

The now incredibly muscular Queen says he doesn't recognize what he sees in the mirror. He flashes back to the shipwreck and we see that he was romantically involved with Sarah on the boat.

Queen's good buddy Tommy Merlyn comes over for dinner. Queen suggests wanting to spend time at the office and Walter doesn't seem to like the idea. It comes out that Walter and Moira are now married and Queen end up excusing himself from the table.

Queen sleeps with the window in his bedroom open. He dreams about the night of the wreck. Laurel's sister Sarah is worried about what their fooling around would do to her sister. The storm rips into the boat and knocks Sarah out to sea. Robert pulls him onto a life raft and tells him ""she's gone."" There is a storm and when Moira comes to check on him, he instinctively grabs her.

The next day, Queen visits Thea and gives her a Buddhist symbol of reconnection. Unbenknownst to him, she appears to be mixed up in drugs.

Tommy wants to organize a huge welcome home party for Queen. Queen says the person he missed the most while he was gone was Laurel.

Queen drops by Laurel's office. She's still very angry with him and ends up saying he should have died.

Queen and Tommy are kidnapped by mask-wearing men with guns. We flash back to Queen's father telling him on the life raft that he isn't the man he thinks he is. The kidnapper wants to know if Queen's father made it to the island and whether he told him anything. Queen is able to escape captivity and kill his attackers.

Queen is interviewed by Laurel's father, Detective Quentin Lance, and his partner, Lucas Hilton. They are skeptical of the claim that a man in a green hood saved them from the abductors. Lance comments on the Queens' wealth, offending Moira, but Walter smooths things over

Queen researches Hunt online. We see that Hunt's name appears on a list in a notebook he brought back with him from the island.

Moira wants Queen to have protection and assigns an ex-military man named John Diggle to be his bodyguard. Queen almost instantly gets away from Diggle and heads to one of his father's abandoned factories. He sets up a secret command post and begins training. His first target is Hunt.

Queen, now outfitted in his Arrow disguise, takes out several of Hunt's men and demands he transfer $40 million into a certain bank account by the following day. If Hunt doesn't comply, Arrow tells him he'll take the money ""and you won't like how.""

Hunt wants Lance and Hilton to make sure they find this ""maniac"" with the green hood. Neither are particularly interested in helping a suspected criminal, but Hunt tells them to coordinate with his head of security, Konstantin Drakon. Hilton concludes that Queen was telling the truth about the hooded vigiliante, Lance tells him that if the vigilante wants trouble, they'll give it to him.

It is the night of Queen's welcome home bash. The party is just across the street from the building where Hunt works. Queen spots his sister with drugs and they get into an argument. Queen literally runs into Laurel and the two of them speak privately. She apologizes for being so harsh with him and asks whether Sarah suffered. Queen tells Laurel he's not a better person than he was and warns her to stay away from him. It sounds like he's protecting her.

Queen gives Diggle the slip yet again. As Arrow, he heads next door and slices through Hunt's security team. He gets Hunt alone in his office and sends an arrow into a cabinet behind him. Arrow ends up getting into a lengthy fight with Drakon and ends up getting knocked to the ground. With Lance and Hilton on their way up the stairs, Arrow is out cold. But he wakes up just in time and leaps out the window, taking a zip line to the building where his party is being held.

Lance and Hilton arrive at the conference center and tell Queen the party is over. Queen tells them they are on private property, but offers a $2 million reward to anyone with information on Arrow. As the crowd cheers, Quentin and Hilton leave and Tommy comments that it's quite a coincidence that Arrow struck near the party. He asks Queen what happened to him on the island, and is told ""a lot."" We see Hunt yelling on the phone that $40 million has been removed from his accounts. The arrow that Queen shot into the wall had some kind of electronic device that tapped into his accounts.

Queen flashes back again to being on the raft with his father. Robert thinks his son is the only one who can survive and tells him to right his wrongs. Robert pulls out a gun and shoots the other man on the raft, then himself.

We see that the clients Laurel has been defending are being wired money that matches what they are owed by Hunt.

Tommy and Laurel go for a walk. They seems to have had an on-and-off romantic thing. Tommy would like to make it permanent, but Laurel doesn't think it can work.

In another voiceover we hear that Queen plans to get revenge on everybody on the list.

Moira meets with the apparent mastermind behind Queen's abduction. After being assured that there is no way the police can trace the kidnapping to her, Moira tells him that there are other ways to find out what Oliver knows about her husband's death."

Cut to Arrow beating up some guards and forcing a bad guy to make good.

Queen is to appear in court as part of legally coming back to life.

On his way into the courtroom Queen flashes back to the storm. He explains to the judge what happened, saying that for those five years on the island he felt he had to live for both he and his father. Queen's declaration of death is rescinded.

Queen runs into an angry Laurel outside the courtroom. Queen watches the press conference of a man being prosecuted by Laurel. Queen instantly gets free from his bodyguard Diggle.

We see Laurel give her opening statement against Martin Somers (Ty Olsson) who was smuggling drugs into the city by way of the Chinese Triads. In order to keep his illegal business going, Somers had a man named Victor killed. Laurel is arguing on behalf of Victor's daughter, Emily.

We learn that Somers' name was on his father's list. Cut to Arrow hanging Somers upside down, shooting arrows at him while demanding he confess to the murder.

Moira complains to Diggle about him continually losing her son. Queen walks in and she asks him where he runs off to when he escapes. Moira asks him to take Diggle with him on his next ""rendezvous."" Diggle tells Queen he'll quit if he's ditched one more time. Thea complains to Queen about him showing up after five years and judging her.

Somers doesn't want to tell Lance anything about his run-in with Arrow. Lance assures him he'll get his man and Somers makes a threat towards Laurel.

Queen gets a tour of the family business. Moira and Walter Steele (Colin Salmon) would like to name a new building after his father and ask him to take a leadership position in the company. Queen seems to have no interest in working for the company and makes a crack about Walter being married to his mother.

Diggle talks to Queen about family and this flashes Queen back to first landing on the island. His father's corpse washes up and he carries the body away from the birds.

Lance drops by Laurel's office and telling her she and Emily are getting 24/7 protective custody. She initially declines, but he says he's just doing his job.

Somers speaks with a female representative of the Triads. She seems to think killing Laurel would be a good idea.

Thea asks Queen about his scars. He says he's not ready to talk about what happened to him there. She takes him out back and shows him his tombstone. She says while he was gone she'd ask him for advice. But now that's he's back she feels less connected to him than she did when he was missing. She asks him to let her in.

Queen drops by Laurel's place. He says he initially blew her off to protect her, but now realizes that he hurt her. He tells her about not wanting to work for the company and his mother seeming not to accept his answer. She says her father blames himself more than he does Queen. Queen hears something and pulls her out just before somebody starts shooting. It's the Triads and Diggle saves the day just before Queen and Laurel are killed. The woman we saw meeting with Somers is also there, but she manages to escape. Lance arrives and thanks Diggle. He then tells Queen to stay away from his daughter.

Diggle noticed that Queen was able to help him by throwing an unbalanced kitchen knife ten feet across the room. Queen tries to brush it off as luck, but Diggle knows better.

Queen gets into his Arrow gear and prepared to go after Somers. Arrow arrives just as Somers is preparing to leave town.

Lance wants Laurel to recuse herself from the case. She won't do it. Lance gets a call about something happening at the docks.

Cut to Arrow fighting his way to Somers. He gets Somers to admit he ordered the Triads to kill Victor. A female member of the Triad, China White (Kelly Hu), shows up and a huge martial arts battle with Arrow ensues. The police show up and Lance has Arrow in his sights. But he shoots an arrow at Lance's arm, knocking the gun away but not harming him. Attached to the arrow is a digital recording of Somers' confession.

Queen decides he needs to be the person everybody thinks he is in order to fulfill his promise to his father.

Cut to Walter beginning the dedication. Queen shows up, seemingly drunk. He grabs the microphone and creates a scene. He says he's not half the man his father was and to ""stop asking me to be.""

Somers is headed to jail. Lance stops by to see Laurel. He's still not happy with Arrow, calling him an anarchist.

Queen crosses Somers' name off his father's list. He then flashes back to bringing his father's body to a rock. Inside his father's pocket his finds a blank journal with a circular logo on the front page.

Moira meets with somebody in the rear of a limousine, telling them that her son has no clue about what is actually going on or that the yacht was actually sabotaged. The person is holding something with the same circular logo.

Queen goes to his father's gravestone. He talks about how hard its been to reconnect and keep his secrets. He reaffirms his pledge to right his father's wrongs, but tells him that to do so he'll have to dishonor his memory. As he leaves, some workers move in to dismantle his headstone.

Back to the island flashback. As he is finishing burying his father under some rocks, Queen is hit in the right shoulder by an arrow. He looks back and sees a person wearing a hood, notching another arrow and preparing to fire at him again as he passed out."

His latest target is James Holder (Tobias Slezak), responsible for defective fire detectors in low-income housing. Arrow confronts Holder, but someone else is watching through a rifle scope. Before Arrow can finish his speech, the rifleman kills Holder and grazes Arrow with another shot.

Back in his lair Queen crosses Holder off his list, then falls to the ground, the result of a what he identifies as a poison bullet. He retrieves some herbs from his kit and ingests them as he passes out.

Flash back to Queen meeting the mysterious hooded man who shot him when he first arrived on the island. He tells him he shot him to protect him and then pulls out the arrow and disappears.

Queen gets to his feet.

A drunken Thea (Willa Holland) is brought home by police after stealing some things from a clothing store. Queen criticizes his mother for letting her stay home from school.

Lance wonders if Arrow might be behind Holder's shooting death.

Queen analyzes the poison, figuring out the shooter was a well-known assassin known as ""Dead Shot."" He doesn't like this guy because he doesn't kill for justice or honor. Dead Shot is now at the top of Queen's list.

Queen is planning to open up a new nightclub. Tommy wants them to check out the competition, a club named ""Poison"" owned by Max Fuller (Marcus Rosner), whose fiancé Queen happened to have slept with. Diggs points out that the new club Queen wants to open is in a rough part of town.

Joanna talks to Laurel about still having feelings for Queen. She wants them to go out that night to help Laurel move on.

Moira grounds Thea for two weeks.

Queen climbs the side of a building to pull something out of a wall.

The police gets back the ballistic report on Holder's murder. Lance still isn't sure and goes to get ""my own evidence.""

Queen determines the shooter was probably working on behalf of the Russian mob. He goes to a garage and asks, in Russian, for someone named Alexi Leonov (Barry Nerling). He shows a tattoo and says his name is ""Bratva."" He asks for information about Dead Shot.

A man named Karl Rasmussen is killed. Lance points out to Walter and Moira that Rasmussen was interested in purchasing a company they were also looking at. The auction for the sale is the following day.

Queen and Tommy drop by Poison, making sure to leave Diggle (David Ramsey) at the door. Laurel is there, as is a very drunk Thea. She spills the beans about Tommy and Laurel's romantic relationship and things get awkward. Fuller shows up and promptly punches Queen in the face. Tommy and Queen end up fighting his bodyguards, with Laurel coming to their rescue with some snappy moves of her own.

Another flashback to Queen on the island. He wakes up next to the man who shot him and runs outside. He quickly runs into a net.

At a restaurant the guys meet Diggle's sister-in-law Carly (Christie Laing). Tommy apologizes to Queen about not telling him about Laurel. Queen doesn't seem worried about it. We learn that Diggle's job somehow got his brother (Carly's husband) killed. Queen gets a call from the Russians, who give him an address for where Dead Shot stayed the last time he was in town.

We see Dead Shot looking at blueprints online.

Arrow arrives at the hotel room, leading to a fight with Dead Shot. Dead Shot jumps out the window and gets away.

Queen pays a visit to a woman named Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) in his IT department. He gives her Dead Shot's damaged laptop in the hopes she can salvage some information.

Moira tells Thea a story about how good her father had been at getting through to her. This is first time he's come up in years.

Felicity finds the blueprints on Dead Shot's laptop. They are of the place where the auction for that company will be taking place. Queen realizes there are too many locations for Dead Shot to fire from. He'll need help.

Arrow grabs Lance and forcefully tells him what he knows about Dead Shot and his weapon of choice.

Thea joins her mother and Walter (Colin Salmon) at the auction. Lance has a large team protecting the area. But Dead Shot has already killed one of the officers and taken his post.

Tommy drops by Laurel's work to talk about the other night. She says she thinks it was obvious Queen already knew about them. Tommy says he wants to be the kind of man she'll want to be with.

Queen is at the auction. He mentions the potential for a shooting to Diggle. At the last minute Lance pushes Walter out of the way, preventing him from being killed.

Queen rushes up the stairs, grabbing his Arrow gear on the way. Diggle follows. Arrow and Dead Shot battle. Arrow eventually drops him with a shot through his right eye, but sees that Diggle has been hit.

We flashback to the island, as the mystery man releases Queen from the net with a warning about others on the island.

Arrow gives Diggle some of his organic antidote for the poison. Diggle struggles into consciousness and sees it was Oliver Queen, unmasked but in his Arrow leathers, who has saved him."

For some reason Diggs decides he should take a swing at Queen. Arrow explains he wants him to join his mission, saying his background as a soldier is perfect. Diggs doesn't seem interested and calls him a criminal and a murderer.

Queen comes home to Laurel waiting on him. She says his family doesn't deserve the selfishness of him keeping his family in the dark after he was shot at. Queen mentions to Laurel that she's the second friend to rip him a new one that night

Queen dreams about the island and trying to communicate with the arrow-wielding gentleman who appears to speak only Chinese. He wakes up and comes downstairs to find Thea watching TV show about a man named Declan who killed his wife a few years back. The two talk about Laurel and he tells her he's not the same guy he used to be.

The next morning Moira tells Queen that Diggs has resigned, telling her he didn't approve of ""Queen's evenings."" The new guy's name is Rob. Moira is also watching a report about Declan, who is set to be executed at midnight the following night. Queen sees that Declan's wife Camille had worked for a man named Brodeur. Queen quickly ditches Rob on his motorcycle.

At the Arrow hideout we see that Brodeur's name is on Queen's list.

Cut to Brodeur talking to an employee about the fact he had Camille killed because she was going to blow the whistle on his company's chemical dumping.

Queen is well aware that Brodeur was probably responsible for Camille's death, meaning an innocent man is about to die.

Queen pays Laurel a visit dressed as Arrow. He tells her about Camille wanting to blow the whistle on Brodeur and Declan being innocent.

Laurel meets with Declan. She goes through the evidence, which sounds damning. He swears that he's innocent.

Walter tells Moira that there is $2 million missing from the company. He thinks it is probably a bookkeeping error.

Laurel tells her father what she heard from Declan. Lance says that Camille's supervisor contradicted her story about going to him about the dumping.

Queen finds Diggs at the restaurant where his sister Carly works. Queen asks him once again to help him do the same kind of good he did in the military. To convince him, Queen shows him his father's journal. Queen tells him he needs to right the wrongs done by his family. He says he thinks the sniper he took out was his brother-in-law Andy's killer. If he helps him, Diggs will have the chance to help other people's families.

Moira tells Walter she thinks the missing money was invested in a friend's start-up a few years back. She'll talk to accounting and have it cleaned up. Walter doesn't look convinced.

Laurel tells Joanna who suggested she look into Declan.

Laurel meets with Arrow. She tells him about the supervisor, a man named Istook, contradicting Camille's story. Arrow tells her that Istook ""hasn't been questioned by me."" He says he's hiding his face to protect the people he cares about.

Walter asks IT wiz Felicity to discretely look into the disappeared $2.6 million.

Arrow pays Istook a visit. After chaining him to some train tracks Istook says he'll give him a file on Brodeur that will help Declan.

Another flashback to Queen on the island. He's hungry and the man hints that to eat he'll need to kill a bird.

Arrow drops off the file to Laurel. She says the city needs somebody like him.

Queen comes home and Thea points out he had a huge grin. He says it's because he's been showing his true self to Laurel.

Lance doesn't like the fact Laurel has been working with Arrow. She points out she wouldn't have to be breaking the law if the police had done their job correctly in the first place. He's not happy.

Laurel shows a judge the file and asks for a stay of the execution. The judge doesn't agree. Brodeur's lawyer Garrett comes in during the conversation and Laurel promises Brodeur she'll come after him.

Brodeur's associates point out to their boss that Laurel will be meeting with Declan at his prison. They have friends in the prison and hint that something bad will happen during the meeting.

Laurel tells Arrow about the problems she's having. Arrow says he'll get a confession.

Felicity tells Walter the money was used to set up an offshore LLC. It's completely off the books. A few years ago it purchased a warehouse in the city.

Diggs tells Carly he misses not making a difference.

Arrow tells Brodeur to confess. After Arrow shoots an arrow through Brodeur's hand his phone rings. Arrow learns what is about to happen to Declan.

During Laurel's meeting with Declan the lights are turned off and an alarm sounds. A virtual riot breaks out and during the confusion Laurel finds herself in the middle of a bunch of cons. Queen, dressed as a security guard, shows up in the nick of time to get her and Declan to safety. In the process he pounds on a con who tried to choke Laurel and she seems disturbed by his brutality.

Outside the prison Lance comes to see his daughter, telling her that Brodeur has confessed. Laurels says she now agrees with him about Arrow, that ""he's a killer."" She looked in his eyes and saw no remorse.

Flash back to a now-starving Queen on the island. He says he's never killed anything before. He grabs the bird and apologizes before breaking its neck.

Laurel tells Lance that the vigilante was wearing a guard uniform. This seems to give Lance an idea.

Walter pays a visit to the warehouse from Moira's LLC. The password ""ROBERT"" gets him inside. Inside he finds the wreckage of the Queen's Gambit, the boat Queen and his father were on.

Lance has the security footage from the Exchange building shooting examined more closely. He finds video of Queen changing into the Arrow outfit.

Queen crosses Brodeur off the list.

It turns out the man Queen is with does speak English. He says the only way he'll survive is if he's willing to kill more than the bird and he forgets about the picture of Laurel.

Moira meets with a man who shows him a picture of Arrow and says the vigilante is targeting ""the list.""

Diggs pays Queen a visit. He says Queen will need somebody to remind him who he really is. At this point, Lance breaks into the house with a team of officers and Queen is placed under arrest."

In present day we see Oliver arrested. Through voiceover, he is confident that he has a way out of this mess.

Lance interrogates Oliver. Oliver assures him he's not a vigilante and has an excuse for being caught on video going into the bag with the hood. Moira and Walter show up and tells Lance the interrogation is over until their attorney arrives. Oliver wants Laurel to represent him.

Moira tells Laurel that Oliver has requested her and won't accept representation if it isn't her. Laurel doesn't think it's a good idea.

Oliver shows up at his arraignment without counsel. The judge advises against it. But once the subject of bail comes up Laurel enters the courtroom and helps him get home confinement. It's clear Laurel doesn't think Oliver could be Arrow.

Oliver has a tracking bracelet put on his ankle. He also wants to host a party at the house to prove he's okay with what's happening.

Laurel argues with her father over going after Oliver. He references Sarah and Laurel says Oliver isn't to blame.

Oliver tells Diggle that what happened with the video was intentional. Oliver tells Diggle about Leo Mueller, a German arms dealer who has arrived in town with military-grade hardware. He wants Diggle to track Mueller and figure out where the buy is happening.

Diggle has access to Oliver's Arrow hideout. He picks out some toys for his mission.

Walter meets with Josiah Hudson, the head of Oliver Consolidated's security, and tells him off the record that he has an assignment for him. He explains that he found the remains of Robert's yacht and wants Josiah to move them to a secure location. When Josiah wonders what's going on, Walter admits that he doesn't know yet.

The prosecutor tells Laurel and Oliver she'll consider a plea of insanity provided he agrees to spend time in an asylum. Oliver wants no part of it and says he'll take a polygraph in front of Lance. Oliver tells Laurel if he fails the polygraph he'll consider the deal.

Another flashback to the island: the mercenaries take Oliver to their commander, a man named Edward Fyers. Oliver tells him he'll be well compensated should he be rescued. Fyers shows Oliver a picture of Yao wearing a military uniform and asks if he knows him. Oliver lies and says no and Fyers picks up on it. Fyers summons his masked enforcer, and tells Oliver that he will suffer for not cooperating. Thea tells Oliver she's worried about how he's been acting since he returned from the island. He assures her isn't the Arrow person.

Moiras business associate, Malcolm, is concerned about the investigation into Oliver. Moira assures him that the charges against Oliver are false, but he suspects that Oliver is hiding something. During the polygraph Oliver flashes back to his interrogation on the island. He passes with flying colors and we see him being tortured by Deathstroke. Lance asks about his scars. Oliver said he wasn't alone on the island and admits to being tortured. Lance then asks if he's killed anyone: ""Yes,"" is the answer, though he's talking about Sarah. Lance still isn't going to drop the charges.

During his party Oliver tells Diggle he wants him to dress up as Arrow and stop the arms deal. Diggle doesn't like the fact he was lied to but agrees to do it. Walter is told the Hudson was killed in a car accident.

Laurel apologizes to Oliver for how Lance acted. She tells him that after her sister died Lance threw himself into his work and her mother ended up leaving. She says she used to hate him, but is now starting to think about what happened to Oliver on the island. She wants to see the scars. He shows them to her and she is stunned. He says he survived because there was something he wanted more than death. They start to kiss but then Laurel pulls away and runs out.

Oliver flashes back to the island. Fyers begins to suspect that Oliver does not have the information he wants, and orders Deathstroke to kill him, but Yao breaks in and knocks Fyers out. Deathstroke attacks him, resulting in furious martial arts duel. The two seem to be evenly matched, but Yao manages to subdue Deathstroke long enough to escape with Oliver.

As Mueller cuts a deal with a street gang for his weapons, the lights in the warehouse go out. As Mueller and his men drive away with the weapons, Diggle takes on the gang members and knocks them out.

Walter tells Moira about finding the boat and the security chief dying. He's doesn't trust her. She doesn't want him to look into it any further.

Diggle calls Oliver to warn him that Mueller got away. While Oliver is on the phone, a man posing as a butler tries to kill him, and the tracking bracelet is broken in the ensuing scuffle. Lance comes in and shoots the attacker. Lance tells the family he's not sure who attacked Oliver. He then takes off the ankle monitor because the vigilante was spotted across town. Oliver thanks Lance.

Moira meets with Malcolm again. He was the one who went after Oliver, thinking he was the vigilante. He also had Hudson killed. Moira warns him that if he touches anybody in her family she'll take him down.

Another island flashback. Yao Fei takes Oliver back to the cave and admits that he's impressed that Oliver didn't break under torture. He reminds him to breathe, gives him the pouch, and heads out to hold off the mercs, sealing the cave mouth with an explosive before Oliver has a chance to follow.

Laurel brings Oliver the polygraph. It turns out there was a slight flutter on an answer she knows he lied about. Oliver says if she knew what happened to him on the island she would look at him differently. He tells her there's no way he could possibly aim a bow and arrow, as he's suffering from what happened to him on the island. She says nothing can ever happen between them and he agrees.

Oliver and Diggle talk about him lying to Laurel. Diggle doesn't think Oliver realizes the impact he's having on his family. Oliver says he thinks about it all the time.

Walter tells Moira he will be flying to Australia on an extended ""business trip,"" he doesn't know how long he will be gone. Lance drowns his sorrows in a bar, and is picked up by Laurel after he has too much to drink. Oliver, back in his Arrow guise, corners Mueller and tells him he has failed his city."

During the robbery they shoot a man who turns out to be an off-duty cop. They escape through a tunnel and outside two of the men argue over the ramifications of what happened.

We see Queen teaching Diggle some martial arts. Queen tells him about a man named Scott Morgan, who inflates utility prices and shuts off service to people in times of need. Diggle wants them to get involved with the men who robbed the bank and put the cop in a comma, but Queen tells him fighting street crime isn't what he's all about. Diggle thinks he could be doing more.

Queen flashes back to the island and seeing his dead father alive.

Laurel and Joanna are dealing with the fact the legal clinic has lost its largest donor. Tommy shows up and wants to take her on an extravagant trip. She says she's too busy.

Thea is concerned about Walter having left town so suddenly. Moira is planning a brunch for a friend of hers and the friend's son, Carter, a person she's apparently always fawned over as the perfect son. Diggle calls Queen with word that Morgan attempted suicide and is in the hospital. Tommy tells Thea he's having love life problems and she gives him some advice.

It turns out Diggle was lying to Queen. When he arrives at the hospital Diggle introduces him to Janet, the wife of Stan, the officer who was shot in the robbery.

Queen and Diggle look at video from the robbery. They spot a ring on one of the fingers of the robbers. Quinn sneaks into the police station as Arrow and downloads information off of one of their computers.

Tommy tells Laurel he wants to sponsor a benefit for the legal clinic. She doesn't want to accept, but Johanna talks her into it.

Using a police image of a person who was punched by the ring, Queen finds a person named Kyle Reston who attended the high school and whose family dropped off the grid before graduation. He thinks the entire Reston family is behind the robberies.

It turns out that Carter, who is a surgeon, is being looked at to be the next TV doctor celebrity. His agent mentioned the possibility of a bidding war for Oliver's story. Oliver tells Carter about opening a nightclub. Diggle calls him away with word that another bank was hit two minutes ago. Moira isn't thrilled when he leaves.

Arrow goes to the bank and gets into a battle with the robbers. He uses special arrows that ensure they aren't able to escape with their money.

Given the shot cop and vigilante interference, the Restons argue over whether they should stop robbing. Kyle refuses, saying the deal was they would continue until they were ""set for life."" The father agrees to one more.

Queen and Diggle have Felicity look into the Restons. It turns out the father, Derrick, worked for Queen's father and was laid-off when the company out-sourced to China. The company even found a loophole to keep from having to pay severance.

Back to the flashback. Queen's father reminds him he begged him to survive. He hands him a gun in case he wants to give up. Queen doesn't think he's strong enough to survive. He tries to shoot himself in the head.

Queen wants to pay Derrick a visit and give him a chance to do the right thing.

While Tommy and Laurel work on the fundraiser she asks him ""why now?"" He tells her the story about going home with a girl and realizing that he's tired of one night stands.

Queen pays Derrick a visit. The discuss Queen's father and making bad choices. Queen apologizes and offers him a job. Derrick says he doesn't need charity from the son of the man who ruined his life. Queen leaves his card.

Queen listens to Derrick and his wife using a bug he planted. Clearly they want to get out, but are worried Kyle will go it alone if they do. They're going to do one more and Queen wants to take them down.

It's the night of the fundraiser. Tommy tells Thea that the advise she gave was in reference to Laurel. Carter is at the fundraiser and strikes up a conversation with Laurel about a free clinic he wants to start. Tommy looks jealous. Moira tells Queen how much it bothers her that she's growing apart from her son. At this exact moment Diggle tells him a bank is being hit. Queen leaves and Moira is furious.

During the Restons next job they hear a noise. Kyle goes to check it out and finds Arrow. While Arrow fights with Kyle and Derrick the security guard wakes up. He ends up shooting Derrick in the chest with a shotgun. While he lays dying Derrick says he turned Kyle into what he's become.

Queen once again flashes back to the meeting with his father, which he's now realized is a hallucination. His father apologizes for never telling him the truth about him.

Arrow leaves the bank just as the police arrive. Derrick is dead.

A drunken Thea starts hitting on Tommy. She tells him Laurel doesn't even like him. Tommy takes her outside to throw up. Laurel comes outside and Tommy tells her he's got it under control. She says she doesn't like Carter and was being nice to him because he was writing a huge check. Laurel gives Tommy a kiss before he leaves to drive Thea home.

Diggle tells a despondent Queen that what happened to Derrick isn't his fault. He thinks his father would be proud of how he acted. He tells him the police officer is out of his coma and will be okay.

Queen flashes to discovering his father's journal on the island. It had been written in disappearing ink.

Moira apologizes to Queen and says with Walter gone she's lonely. They go out for burgers and milkshakes."

Moira (Susanna Thompson) and a man named Paul Copani (Benjamin Wilkinson) emerge from Queen Consolidated. Copani wants Moira to go over a building contact, but she doesn't want to do business with him. Suddenly another motorcycle drives up on the sidewalk and the masked rider shoots Copani several times in the chest with an automatic pistol. After checking to see that Moira wasn't hit, Oliver chases the motorcyclist on foot and is almost able to catch up with them before a passing truck gives the shooter a chance to escape.

Moira hit her head during the event and is treated at the hospital by Dr. Lamb (Hiro Kanagawa) for a concussion. Thea has been unable to reach Walter by phone. In the hospital hallway, Thea doesn't seem to believe that Oliver left their mother to get the number of the killer's license plate. Detectives Quentin Lance (Paul Blackthorne) and Lucas Hilton (Roger Cross) arrive at the hospital soon after, and Oliver tells them that he wants his mother to get some security, but Lance doesn't think it's necessary, as he believes that Copani was targeted because of his mob connections, and Moira was just collateral damage.

Tommy Merlyn (Colin Donnell) drops by to visit Laurel (Katie Cassidy) with Chinese food. He wants to ask her out on a proper date at some time in the near future, and they discuss the on-again, off-again nature of their relationship.

While Oliver trains at the hideout, Diggle (David Ramsey) suggests that he take some time off, given the recent events. Oliver tells Diggs that Copani worked for a man named Frank Bertinelli. Publicly, Frank is CEO of a major construction company, but he is a major player in the Starling City Mafia, and Copani is the third associate to fall to this assassin's bullets. Oliver wants to go undercover and get close to Frank to figure out what is going on. He says he thinks his sister is right to think he's not being honest, as he can't tell them he's fast enough to nearly catch a motorcycle on foot. His goal now is to protect his family.

We see the motorcycle driver arrive at a garage and removes the helmet; revealing a dark haired woman, the Huntress (Jessica De Gouw). She draws an X through a photo of Copani on a corkboard full of photos, and smiles.

Thea is preparing to leave Queen Manor for a night on the town. Oliver tells her he will not be able to relieve her as previously planned, as something important has come up. As Thea is expressing her annoyance, Tommy drops by to ask about Moira. He uses this time to tell Oliver about his interest in Laurel. Oliver wishes the best for the both of them.

Oliver drops by the Bertinelli Estate where Frank (Jeffrey Nordling) introduces his caporegime Nick Salvati (Tahmoh Penikett), and as they go to have a drink and discuss business, Oliver spots the female motorcyclist at the top of the stairs.

During a girls' night in with Moira, Thea expresses displeasure at Oliver's recent behavior. Moira suggests that they give him the benefit of the doubt. Spending five years apart from civilization probably changed him, they should try to accept him for who he is now.

Bertinelli says he wants the building contract for Queen Consolidated's Applied Sciences division as Nick leaves to take a phone call. Moira had obviously been telling him no, but Oliver says he's leaning the other way. The Huntress walks into the room and is introduced as Bertinelli's daughter, Helena. Bertinelli needs to leave for a quick meeting... the phone call to Nick... and asks Helena to take Oliver out for dinner. She's reluctant, bitterly accusing her father of ""pimping out your daughter"" and calling Queen ""the rich man's Lindsay Lohan,"" but after being reminded that the family business is dying, she ultimately agrees.

Frank and Nick meet with Starling City Triad's Red Pole Enforcer, Zhi-shan (David Lyle), with China White (Kelly Hu) serving as his interpreter. They say they are not responsible for the attacks on his people, but Frank doesn't believe them, promising vengeance if the attacks continue. After they leave, Nick asks his boss what the Triad would have to gain by coming after him, but Frank says that no one has ever credited the Triad with rational thinking, and doesn't think anyone else is powerful enough to threaten him.

Lance and Hilton are listening to this exchange. They wonder if another organized crime family is responsible, but Lance points out the last shooting was not done by a pro.

At dinner, Helena asks Oliver why his family would want to be in business with her father. She clearly is not dealing well with the pressure of her family. She asks Oliver about being alone on the island, and if there were any moments when he just felt ""free."" He admits that there were many times like that.

Tommy and Laurel go to an Indian restaurant for dinner, and Tommy expresses his desire for a fresh start between the two of them. The waiter (Sachin Sahel) returns, saying that Tommy's credit card has been declined, and he has been ordered to confiscate it.

Oliver comments on a cross Helena is wearing. It is was a gift from her deceased fiancé, Michael Staton. They are hitting it off when Diggs calls him with word he has to leave. As he excuses himself, Helena warns him to be careful dealing with her father.

Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman) drops by to see Moira in her bedroom. He's there to make sure her convictions haven't changed based on recent events and she assures him they have not.

Diggs pulled Oliver out of his dinner because Nick has been going around town violently shaking down anyone who owes Bertinelli protection money. The next potential victim is the owner (John Cassini) of Russo's, the restaurant where he had dinner with Helena. Nick and an associate are looking for a second payment for the month. Just before they can break the fingers of Russo and his wife, Jenny (Sanya Silver), both Arrow and the Huntress show up to thwart the criminals. In the ensuing fracas, Nick escapes and Arrow and Huntress end up fighting each other. Near the end of the fight, Arrow pulls off her helmet and sees who she is. Helena rushes off, with Arrow ultimately choosing to let her go.

Back at the hideout, Oliver is adamant that Helena must have a good reason for targeting her family. Diggs isn't interested in her reasons, just that she's a killer, who will start a mob war if she isn't stopped. Oliver insists he knows what he's doing, but Diggs doesn't believe him.

Looking through security footage of the night of the fight, Lance and a CSU technician spot Oliver having dinner with Helena. He drops by Queen Manor and tells him to stay away from Helena. Lance thinks he's repaying Oliver for almost getting him killed a few weeks back.

Tommy visits his father and demands to know why he has been cut off. Malcolm calls his son ""a joke that is no longer funny"" and says he's tired of Tommy's ""chronic irresponsibility and terminal laziness,"" so he is yanking away his trust fund and freezing all his assets.

Oliver follows Helena to Michael's grave. She says that losing him changed her. Her love for him turned to a hate that she cannot let go of. As she tells Oliver to stay away from her, Nick pulls up and loads them both into a van at gunpoint.

Oliver and Helena are taken to an abandoned warehouse and tied up. Nick tells Helena that he knows that she has betrayed the family, as he found her crucifix at Russo's. Helena reveals she wanted revenge on her father for ordering Michael's death. Nick reveals that Michael was an informant for the FBI, he found his laptop with evidence that would have destroyed the family if the Feds had gotten hold of it. Helena says it was her laptop, and denounces her father as a monster. Nick taunts her by revealing that he shot Michael in the heart, his personal calling card, and now he will kill her the same way. Before he can pull the trigger, Oliver breaks free of his restraints and tackles Nick. While Nick staggers to his feet, his goons attack Oliver. Helena breaks free of her own restraints and savagely attacks Nick. As Oliver disposes of his opponents, Nick tells Helena that she will ""burn in hell"" for what she has done, and Helena tells him that it will be worth it, before snapping his neck. When Oliver looks at her questioningly, she replies ""I didn't have a choice, Oliver. No one can know my secret!""

Lance and Hilton review security footage of the fight. Both of them have ruled out Arrow as a suspect, but Lance hopes that Bertinelli hasn't, because he will ""start World War III"" if he believes the Triads are responsible.

Tommy goes to see Laurel and tells her that all of his assets has been frozen, he has consequently lost his car and his apartment. She thinks he'll be fine.

Walter (Colin Salmon) arrives in town and shows up at Moira's side. He says he's there because he misses her.

Thea apologizes to Oliver for chewing him out at the hospital, saying she's just worried about him. She understands the need for secrets, but he needs to find someone he can share them with.

Oliver sneaks into Helena's apartment. She's figured out that he's Arrow after seeing his fighting style. He tells her that what she's doing is revenge rather than justice. She thinks they're the same. He disagrees, but they both feel relieved to finally be able to open up to somebody. Oliver and Helena share a long, deep kiss."

Thinking he is still asleep, slips out of bed and changes into her Huntress gear. She drives to an alleyway in Triad territory and sees China White escorting Zhi-shan to his car. Helena prepares to shoot him, but Arrow drops down and throws off her her aim. The Triads open fire and drive off, and Helena berates Oliver for ruining her plan. She explains that she planned to kill Zhi-shan and let her father Frank take the blame so that the Triad would wipe out his weakened organization. Oliver denounces the plan as reckless, and offers to show her the difference between justice and revenge.

Oliver takes Helena to Big Belly Burgers, Helena reminds Oliver that he has used lethal force on enemies in the past. He insists that he only does so when there is no other option. If they're going to take down Frank, they do it without collateral damage, or they don't do it at all. Helena rebukes him and walks out.

When Oliver returns to the Arrowcave, he tells Diggle that he spent the night with Helena, and she knows he is Arrow. Diggle voices his disapproval, prompting Oliver to remind him Helena was going to turns state's evidence against her father. Diggle acknowledges that she deserves her fair share of sympathy, but insists that her anger has warped her, and that Oliver's attempts to redeem her are a fool's errand.

While Walter is getting ready for work, Moira assures him that she lied to him about the boat to protect him, and she is still the woman he fell in love with. He assures her that things are good between them now, but he wants them to be honest with each other going forward. Moira agrees. Walter drives Thea to school before going to work.

At the Bertinelli estate, Helena enters the parlor to see Frank offering condolences to Nick Salvati's widow, Dana. Once Dana leaves, Frank promises violent revenge on Nick's killers. Oliver arrives for an impromptu visit, wanting to speak with Helena. Frank leaves so they can talk privately. Helena reiterates her earlier rebuff, but Oliver convinces her to accompany him to Sara Lance's grave.

At the gravesite, Oliver tells Helena about sleeping with Sara behind Laurel's back, saying that this was how he reacted when a woman got close to him. Before his time on the island, he was a terrible person who hurt the ones he loved. Helena doesn't think she can open herself up to anyone after Michael. Oliver assures her that he will never hurt her.

Oliver takes Helena to the Arrowcave, attempting to teach her kyudo (a mixture of archery and martial arts). Helena does not see the point of using such a ""primitive"" weapon, but she seems impressed by Oliver's skills. He tells her that bow inspires patience and focus. He shows her the list, and Helena recognizes one of the names: Anthony Venza, a drug runner on her father's payroll. Diggle arrives, clearly not happy to see Helena at the hideout. Sensing the tension between the two men, Helena politely exits. Diggle voices his disapproval at sharing his secret with Helena, and again warns against trusting her. He figures that Oliver wants to change her so that by extension he can change himself, but Oliver ignores his warnings.

Tommy comes by the legal office to see Laurel and invites her to a swanky restaurant. She reminds him that he no longer has a steady stream of income, and then suggests that he ask Oliver for a job as a general manager at his new club. Tommy agrees to talk to Oliver about it the next time he sees him.

At Queen Consolidated, Felicity tells Walter about her investigations into Tempest. She's discovered that someone else was monitoring Moira's transfer of funds and that she managed to trace them back enough to get a symbol belonging to the hacker, it is the same standard that Oliver found on the island with Robert's personal effects. Still feeling guilty about Josiah Hudson's death, Walter threatens to suspend her if she pursues this any further. But after Felicity nervously leaves, Walter takes another look at the symbol.

Helena returns to the hideout, Oliver tells her that they're going to take down Venza, but they're doing it his way. He gives her a modified Huntress costume, with light ballistic mesh body armor and a domino mask to conceal her identity. He also gives her a crossbow, seeing it as a ""compromise"" between a gun and a bow.

Venza is telling his dealers that any two bit hood can sell hard drugs such as crack, but that prescription pills are the future. Arrow and Huntress emerge from the shadows and tell Venza that he has failed the city. They subdue Venza and his men without killing them. Helena seems to like not having to kill anybody.

Frank is furious when he learns of Venza's arrest, as it has dealt massive damage to his organization. He does seem happy that Helena seems to be happy with Oliver.

Back at Queen Manor, Moira tells Walter that she is leaving for a board meeting. Walter's curiosity gets the better of him, and he eventually finds a small notebook with blank pages, identical to Robert's journal.

Tommy and Laurel are at the restaurant, but it is crowded. Tommy attempts to use what influence he has left to get the seated more quickly, but this fails when the hostess realizes he has no money. Oliver and Helena are having a dinner date at the same restaurant, and they invite Tommy and Laurel to sit with them.

During dinner, Helena becomes unconfortable at the way Oliver and Laurel are looking each other. Laurel attempts to break the ice by asking Oliver about the job at his club. Helena realizes that Laurel was the woman that Oliver described earlier at the cemetery, while Tommy angrily goes out to get some air. Tommy and Helena are both convinced that Oliver and Laurel still have feelings for each other. Tommy tells Laurel that he doesn't need her charity, and that she'd be better off with Oliver because he has money. Helena tells Oliver that the manner in which she was introduced to Laurel was ""messed up,"" and she angrily storms off wanting nothing more to do with him.

Tommy drops by Laurel's apartment to apoligize. He says that he has never had to be responsible before, and now that he has to be, it scares him. Laurel insists that her feelings for Tommy have nothing to do with his money.

At the hideout, Oliver tells Diggle he was right about Helena. He didn't want to believe that she was too dark and beyond help, because he felt that he was entitled to a relationship with a kindred spirit after keeping everyone else at arm's length for so long. But after the double date with Tommy and Laurel, he has burned up any currency he had with Helena.

Zhi-shan and his bodyguards are playing cards at a warehouse when the Huntress breaks in and guns them down. Zhi-shan, in his native Mandarin, recounts the old proverb of someone seeking revenge digging two graves, one for their target, and one for themselves. Unmoved, the Huntress replies ""I don't speak Chinese,"" and coldly shoots Zhi-shan down. She leaves one of the thugs alive, telling him that Frank Bertinelli ordered the hit.

At Queen Consolidated, Walter shows Felicity the notebook. He apologizes for threatening her earlier, but warns her that someone else has already died pursuing leads on Tempest. After she accepts the risks, he gives her the notebook.

Arrow arrives at the scene of Helena's Triad massacre and calls Diggle to tell him war is coming.

China White leads an assault on the Bertinelli estate, taking out all of the guards. Arrow arrives and takes on the Triad death squad, while Frank runs to his safe to recover a pistol and Helena's laptop. China finds him and prepares to kill him, but Arrow arrives in time to take her down. As more Triads move in, Arrow tells Frank to run.

As Frank runs out the back, the Huntress shoots him in the leg with a crossbow bolt. When he wonders what she's doing, Helena tells her father that it's payback for Michael. Frank freely admits he had Michael killed but insists that he did it to protect the family. Undeterred, the Huntress prepares to kill Frank, but Arrow disarms her, warning her that killing her own father is not something she can come back from. The Huntress insists that she seeks no return, and attacks Arrow. While they fight, Frank picks up the crossbow and shoots Helena in the shoulder. Arrow knocks Frank out and carries the Huntress to safety.

Helena awakens at the Arrowcave, the ballistic mesh in her jacket saved her life. She insists that they should have killed Frank, as his legal connections will make it impossible to keep him locked up. Oliver assures her that the police found her laptop, which contains enough incriminating evidence to put Frank in prison for the rest of his life. Helena tells Oliver that she now realizes that justice and revenge are two different things, but it is revenge that she is after. She warns him to stay out of her way.

Diggle finds Oliver at Big Belly Burgers. They discuss love, and Diggle shares that he believes it's about finding the right person, and not molding someone else into who you want them to be. Oliver comments on how he blew his chance with Laurel, and Diggle tells him that he will meet the right person when he is ready.

Felicity returns to Walter's office with the notebook. She tells him that the pages are not empty, just written on a special kind of ink that can only be visible through ultraviolet lighting. It appears to be the same list that Robert gave to Oliver.

An unseen figure, who Hunt seems to recognize, makes an unexpected visit. Hunt asks the visitor if he is here to extract another pound of flesh. The intruder responds by firing three arrow into Hunt's chest, killing him.

Oliver and Diggle spar in the Arrowcave. Diggle points out that Oliver has really thrown himself into his vigilante work since his breakup with Helena, having taken down three of the men on the list in a single week. He tells Oliver that he's taking his nephew to the mall for Christmas shopping and Oliver realizes that it's Christmas. He explains that on the island he was too busy trying to survive to keep track of things like holidays, and remembers how his father Robert, would put Christmas trees in every room of the manor. Diggle tells Oliver that he deserves a break and to go spend time with his family on Christmas.

Yao Fei unseals the cave and is surprised that Oliver is still alive. He leaves Oliver a jug of water and a rabbit for food. When Oliver inquires as to where he has been Yao brings in a surprise prisoner: Eddie Fyers. Oliver's first thought is to gain revenge on the man who tortured him, but Yao Fei tells him that he is more valuable to them alive, as they can use his private plane to return to civilization.

Oliver returns to Queen Manor and discovers Thea leaving their parents' dinner party. He asks about the lack of Christmas decorations and Thea hesitantly says that everyone was just too busy to bother. Oliver then joins the dinner party where Moira and Walter are hosting several rich and important guests, including Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman) and Police Commissioner Brian Nudocerdo. They discuss the Hood and whether his actions are justified. While Nudocerdo voices his disapproval of vigilantes, Malcolm notes that the crime rate has gone down for the first time in 5 years. Nudocerdo insisits that his new departental policies are responsible, but Walter suggests that the Hood has put the fear in the criminal element. Malcolm asks Oliver his opinion. Feining neutrality, Oliver says the vigiliante needs a better cryptonym than ""the Hood."" Malcolm suggests ""Green Arrow,"" which Oliver snidely dismisses it as ""lame"". Their conversation is interrupted when Walter gets a call from Felicity. He takes it in the other room and she tells him that seven of the men on the list have been taken down by the Hood. Walter is not surprised by this, but Felicity quickly gets his attention by revealing that Dr. Doug Miller, the head of Applied Sciences at Queen Consolidated, is also on the list. Felicity suspects that Miller may be the Hood's next target. Meanwhile, Nudocerdo's aide whispers a message to him and he tells the guests that the vigilante has struck again and killed Adam Hunt, his first victim. Oliver fakes a call from a contractor and promptly exuses himself.

Quentin Lance arrives at Hunt's apartment and meets with Nudocerdo, while Arrow eavesdrops from balcony. Nudocerdo suggests the Hood is responsible, but Lance disagrees, the arrows used to kill Hunt were black instead of green, and the Hood had already shut down Hunt's Ponzi scheme and left him a broken man; killing him now would make no sense. He suggests a copycat is responsible.

The next day, Oliver and Diggle try to work out who killed Hunt. Oliver points out the placing of the three arrows in Hunt's chest and figures that the killer is an expert archer. He figures the archer used custom arrows that can be traced and tells Diggle that they'll get one from the police. At the police station, Quentin recieves a disposable cellphone, which begins ringing almost immediately after he picks it up. Using a voice distorter, Oliver tells Quentin the Hood is not a very good nickname for him. He then insists that he didn't kill Hunt, but he needs Quentin's help to track the real killer. He insists that he can go places that the police can't Quentin isn't interested, but Oliver warns that the killer will likley strike again, and instructs him to call the pre-programmed number if he changes his mind.

Walter calls Dr. Miller into his office and tells him that security red-flagged him as someone the vigilante might come after. Miller claims that he has no idea why the vigilante would want him.

Oliver and Thea are having lunch at Big Belly Burgers, and Oliver again inquires about the lack of Christmas celebration. Before she can answer, a young man named Shane Colvin comes in and asks if Thea wants to hang with him and his friends. She passes, explaining that she's with her brother. After Shane leaves, Oliver returns to the topic and Thea explains that after Oliver and Robert disappeared at sea, no one felt like celebrating Christmas. After that they just kept avoiding it for the next four years. Thea doesn't consider this a big deal, but Oliver clearly does.

Later, Oliver gathers his family and expresses his desire to resume the annual Christmas party. He went without Christmas during his time on the island, and he knows that he was the reason they stopped celebrating, so now, he can be the reason they celebrate it again. ""I know that I haven't been the son, the stepson, or the brother that all of you deserve, especially lately, but this feels like the right moment to start making up for lost time."" Moira agrees and Oliver tells them that he'll handle all of the arrangements. As the family leaves, Walter tells Oliver that he's a good man.

Yao Fei leads Fyers and Oliver through the forest, and the mercenary tells Oliver that he can tell that he's a good man, since he suffered torture rather than betray Yao Fei. Fyers asks Oliver what he knows about Yao and explains that Lian Yu was a prison. The Chinese army kept the prisoners there that were too dangerous to imprison anywhere else. When they shut down the island 8 years ago, they sent Fyers and his men in to purge the facility. Only two prisoners were spared: Yao Fei and Slade Wilson. When Oliver points out that Fyers had Slade torture him, the mercenary says that he only did it to find Yao, who had ""slaughtered dozens of people,"" and asks what Oliver would have done in his position.

Moira meets with Malcolm at a secret location. He tells her that Miller reported to him, and that Walter knows more than he should about the list. Moira suggests she talk with him, but Malcolm says they are past the point of conversation. He recalls how she blackmailed him into staying away from her family. He has honored that agreement, but now it seems her family isn't staying away from him. He wonders if they need to bring in their ""associate"" to clean things up. Moira nervously assures him that she will handle it.

A businessman, Nelson Ravich, is walking home when the Dark Archer kills him. Nudocerdo and Lance arrive sometime later and close the crime scene. They know that the Hood terrorized Ravich into giving up his embezzlement funds a week ago. Nudocerdo tells Quentin to accuse the Hood of the two murders but Quentin refuses, pointing out that it doesn't match the Hood's normal pattern of leaving his victims alive once he gets what he wants from them. The commissioner takes Lance off the case and leaves, while the detective goes back to the station. After careful consideration, Quentin calls Oliver and tells him that he left one of the black arrows at a heating vent. However, he warns the Hood that the vigilante has until Christmas to find the killer, after that, he'll come after him, ""copycat or not.""

Oliver recovers the black arrow and goes over it with Diggle. They confirm that it's a custom job and that the Dark Archer is deliberately trying to call Oliver out. Oliver takes the arrow to Queen Consolidated and asks Felicity if she can confirm the point of origin so he can order more for a friend. She does so, and discovers that the company holding the patent on the arrow is called Sagittarius, after the famous archer on the Zodiac calendar. Felicity locates the address of the shipment and gives it to Oliver, who wishes her a happy Hanukah and departs.

When Laurel comes home, she finds her father listening to Nudocerdo's press statement on the news. She figures that the Hood isn't the killer, reminding Quentin that the vigilante protected her during the prison breakout. Tommy arrives at the apartment and Quentin rebuffs his attempts to impress him. Laurel reminds Tommy that she wanted to be with her father on Christmas, but he says that Christmas is a time for people to be together, and points out that she's holding something back. When he invites her to the Queen holiday party, Laurel refuses and Tommy gives her his Christmas present and leaves. Quentin complains about how Tommy and Oliver are selfish and Laurel should stay away from both of them. She's surprised and touched to discover that Tommy's gift is an old photo of herself, Quentin, and Sara.

Oliver dons his Arrow costume and goes to the address that received the black arrows. A single black arrow is rammed into a table and as Oliver examines it, the door slams shut behind him. A bomb lights off and begins a countdown, and Oliver blasts the door open with an explosive arrow and gets out just in time. He goes back to the manor where the party is in full swing and tells Diggle what happened. As they talk, Shane comes in with flowers for Moira. Oliver has his family pose for a Christmas party and then Thea goes off with Shane, Moira tells Walter that they'll talk later and goes off. Tommy and Laurel arrive and Oliver goes to greet them. Tommy still think things are weird between Laurel and Oliver and goes off to get drinks.

When Walter finds Moira, she reminds him that he promised not to investigate any further. Walter reminds his wife that Robert was his oldest friend and that he had no intention of letting the murderers go free. He asks his wife if whatever she is protecting is worth the lies, and Moira explains that she salvaged the boat to use as leverage against the organization. Walter offers to help fight them, but Moira says that she is one of them, and that she hoped Walter's love could save her. He accepts her explanation for the moment and tells her that the time for lies is over, and Moira promises to tell him everything after the party.

Laurel and Oliver talk privately and she figures that he's still uncomfortable with the fact that she's with Tommy. Oliver insists that he's fine and Laurel admits that since Oliver was declared dead, she hasn't been able to connect emotionally with anyone. She tells Oliver that Tommy is the first person that she has been with in five years, and Oliver assures her that he's happy for them.

Once Laurel leaves, Oliver goes to find Thea and discovers her in bed with Shane. He kicks Shane out and demands to know why Thea is skipping the party. She angrily explains that the party is something he's doing to make himself feel better and that all it's doing is digging up old memories that she'd rather forget. Oliver wonders why she wants to forget, and Thea tells him that things will never again be as they were before his disappearance. As she walks away, Diggle comes in to tell Oliver that the copycat situation has escalated. They tune in the news and discover that the Dark Archer has captured five hostages and is holed up at an abandoned warehouse. One of the hostages reads a statement from the Dark Archer, accusing the police of lacking the will do what justice demands. He will execute 1 hostage every hour unless Arrow faces him alone. Diggle suggests that the police handle it, but Oliver insists that it's his responsibility and assures his partner that he handled much worse on the island.

Yao Fei tells Fyers to radio his troops and instruct them to bring the plane. Fyers tells them that won't be necessary, as they should be arriving any minute. ""Do you not think it convenient to capture me so easily?"" As Yao and Oliver realize they've been lured into a trap, Slade emerges from the jungle, flanked by two mercenaries armed with AK-74 assault rifles. As Slade draws his ninjato, Yao engages him in melee combat while Oliver draws the gunmen away. Oliver manages to lose the lose the gunmen, but Slade overpowers Yao, who is forced to surrender as more troops arrive.

The police gather outside the warehouse but quickly discover that the Dark Archer has booby-trapped all of the doors. As Quentin arrives, the police see Arrow slide into the warehouse through a window. Arrow quickly frees the hostages and gets them to the roof, and then goes down to find the archer. The Dark Archer, wearing a mask which disguises his voice, tells Arrow that he's eager to see which one of them is the better archer, and took hostages because he knew it would take something dramatic to lure him out. The two archers duel throughout the bowels of the warehouse, at first seeming to be evenly matched, but the Dark Archer gains the upper hand. Arrow is brought down by two arrows to the back. As he mercilessly kicks Arrow in the ribs, the Dark Archer reveals that he knows about the list, and the man who wrote it wants ""the Hood"" dead. As the Dark Archer moves in to unmask his prey, Arrow stabs him in the leg with one of his arrowheads. As the villain flees, Oliver radios Diggle for help, and then passes out.

When Oliver wakes up, he's in the hospital with Diggle at his side. The bodyguard explains that he cleaned up the evidence and carried Oliver away. Oliver's injuries include a few cracked ribs. Walter, Thea, and Moira arrive and Diggle tells them that Oliver was in a motorcycle accident. They're all relieved to see that he's okay and they admit that they weren't at their best during the party. However, they're all there now for Oliver and that's what matters. Thea stays behind to apologize to Oliver, she realizes he is not the same person that he was five years ago, but nether is she. They agree to accept each other as they are now and share a hug.

The Dark Archer returns to his hideout and removes his mask, revealing his identity of Malcolm Merlyn.

Walter checks in at his office. After taking a call from Felicity, he gets into the elevator and the other passenger injects him with a sedative.

Moira demands a meeting with Malcolm, well aware that he's had Walter abducted. Malcolm promises that Walter won't be harmed and that he will never know that Moira is involved. When she complains, Malcolm reminds her that the Tempest Organization is only six months away from rebuilding the city to their dreams. Moira realizes that Malcolm feels nothing despite the fact that their plans will cost thousands their lives, but Malcolm tells her that he'll feel a sense of accomplishment, and Walter will be returned to her when it's over.

In the hospital room, Oliver admits to Diggle that he failed the city, but the bodyguard reminds him that he saved five lives. He figures that Oliver will capture the Dark Archer, but Oliver believes that the author of the list is the true threat, and resolves to find him."

Tommy comes over for breakfast and Queen tells him about his mother acting erratically. Queen sees a news report about the robbery.

Queen tells Diggle the technique used to rob the armored trucks (the third-such robbery this month) reminds him of a military procedure he saw while researching a security firm called Blackhawk. It's run by a man on the list named Ted Gainer. Gainer was Diggle's commanding officer during his first tour in Iraq and he's not happy the man is on the list.

She goes upstairs to take it to her room. Malcolm shows Moira a picture of Walter. Thea sees this and thinks this is more evidence she's cheating.

Queen drops by the police station and meets with a vice detective named Hall he knew from their younger days. She is aware of the Count's name and shows him a file. She gently asks him to let the police handle the situation. Lance notices Queen is snooping around and asks Hall about it.

In order to make an example the Count injects pure Vertigo directly into the blood stream of the dealer from the opening scene. This apparently creates agonizing pain for hours or days and eventually causes the person's heart to give out. The Count hands him a gun with one bullet, giving him the option to take revenge or end the misery. The man shoots himself. The Count finds it ""interesting"" that Arrow is coming for him.

Thea says she doesn't want to do it and Queen is furious. After Laurel leaves Thea says essentially that she wants to go to jail to ruin Moira's life. Queen tells her their father admitted he was a liar on the boat. Moira overhears this and is upset with Queen.

Queen and Diggs meet with The Count. Queen says he wants to have something to offer his nightclubs customers. The Count tells him that 56 people died to perfect his product. Lance and Hall pull up with several vehicles to bust the meeting. The Count gets away, on his way injecting Queen in the chest with what we assume is the pure form of Vertigo. Queen and Diggs manage to get away.

Diggs mixes up some kind of medicine and gives it to Queen.

During a flashback Queen recalls his fight with Fei. Fei beats him severely, then does the fake death move on Queen.

Queen wakes up from his Vertigo state, with Diggs telling him that The Count only got a half dose into him. Queen's told that The Count got away but they have a sample of what he injected into him.

Lance and Hall pay Queen a visit. Hall says she saw him at the scene. Queen tells them he was working on getting The Count. Lance says if they spot him at another deal he'll be put in jail. Moira tells Thea she had been lying to her about Robert because she wanted to preserve her positive memory of him. They appear to make up.

George cites the Hood vigilante taking down Frank Bertinelli and China White, and the Huntress murdering White's boss, as ""contingencies that couldn't be anticipated."" Cyrus hugs him in understanding, claiming that all is forgiven... then stabs him with a switchblade and appropriates the mansion as his own.

At the Arrowcave, Oliver shows Diggle the notebook he got from Felicity. Diggle finds it suspicious that Moira would have a copy of her late husband's list, but Oliver attempts to write it off as a coincidence. Diggle understands Oliver wanting to believe that his mother is innocent, but the evidence is suggesting otherwise, especially Walter's recent disapperance.

Using the map he stole from the mercanary camp, Oliver comes upon the remains of a downed cargo plane. As he attempts to loot the supply cache, an Australian man in commando gear drops down from a hole in the ceiling and holds a sword to Oliver's throat. Oliver tells him that Yao Fei sent him.

At the police station, Quentin and his commanding officer, Lt. Pike, are arguing over Quentin's recent change of assignment. Quentin insists he is getting close to catching the Hood, but Pike notes that the vigilante has done a lot of good in recent months, and demand for his capture is beginning to wane.

Moira is getting ready to leave Queen Manor when Oliver tactfully confronts her about the notebook. He claimes to have looked up the names online and discovered they are all bad people. Moira tells Oliver that prior to his death, Robert kept a list of people who owed him favors. She reminds him that Robert kept many secrets from the family. She proceeds to destroy the notebook, citing that Walter's disappearance as proof that the only way to keep the family safe is to stop asking questions.

Thea begins her CNRI internship with Laurel, and is introduced to Anastasia, who is on pro bono sabbatical from her high-paying law firm. Anastasia tells Laurel about Cyrus's recent release from prison. Laurel protests, but the District Attorney is adamant that there is nothing they can do without new evidence. As she plans her next move, she gets a call from Tommy, inviting her to join in sampling some chefs who are being auditioned for the club, but Laurel says that she has to call someone and says that she'll go out with him the next night.

Oliver returns to the Arrowcave and tells Diggle about the destruction of the notebook. Diggle sees it as a confirmation that Moira is hiding something, and says that if it were anyone else, Oliver would be donning the Green Arrow hood and confronting them. Their conversation is interrupted when Laurel calls Oliver's ghost phone. Laurel tells him that she needs evidence that will put Vanch back behind bars. Oliver points out that he doesn't gather evidence but Laurel insists that The Hood is the only one who can help her. As Oliver leaves to help her, Diggle asks if he is just using this as an excuse to run away from the truth about Moira. Oliver refuses to dignify this with a response. CTU tech Kelton informs Quentin that after listening in on the bugged cell phone, he's confirmed that Laurel is meeting with The Hood. Quentin heads to Pike's office, saying that if there is a task force, he wants to be on it.

Vanch tells Vivian that with White and Bertinelli out of the picture, there is a power vaccuum in Starling City's underworld, and he plans on filling it. He plans to do ""something spectacular"" to earn the respect of the other gangs. While they converse, Arrow sneaks into Vanch's mansion, takes out a few of his guards and ends up shooting an arrow into a wall near him. Vanch pulls out the arrow and tells Vivian his plan is to get rid of Arrow.

Laurel and Tommy are preparing to go out when Laurel gets a call from The Hood. He tells her that he has evidence on Vanch and to meet him at the Winnick Building. Meanwhile, Quentin listens in and then tells his task force that they're to use rubber bullets to keep Laurel unharmed, but to do whatever it takes to capture The Hood. As he prepares to go, Lucas warns Quentin that Laurel won't be happy when she learns that her father used her as bait. Quentin insists that Laurel is disobeying his orders to stay away from the vigilante. Meanwhile, Laurel tells Tommy that she has some work to take care of and will meet him in a few hours. When Moira's regular chauffer mysteriously calls in sick, Diggle arranges to take his place. She has him drop her off at a restaurant. Once she goes inside, Diggle follows her in only to discover that she's attending a friend's birthday party. When Moira asks why he's there, Diggle says that he looking for the restroom.

Laurel meets The Hood on the roof of Winnick Building and he gives her the recording he made of Vanch's plans. Quentin and his men storm the roof and The Hood grabs Laurel and uses her as a shield. After giving her a whispered apology, The Hood leaps off the roof to the patio below and ducks into the building. Quentin recklessly charges after him, but The Hood knocks him out and makes his escape.

At the precinct, Laurel expresses her outrage at being manipulated. When Quentin reminds her that she disobeyed his orders, Laurel points out that he bugged the phone after warning her and he wanted her to contact The Hood, and his obsession is leading him down a self-destructive path. Quentin tells her that he will need the ghost phone back. Disgusted, Laurel slams it down on the desk and walks away.

Oliver tells Diggle about the ambush, and Diggle suggests that Oliver ""cannot see straight"" with either Laurel or Moira. He has been surveilling Moira, because someone with an unbiased perspective needs to keep an eye on her. Oliver initially disapproves, but Diggle convinces him that there is nothing wrong with driving her around for a few days.

Laurel tells Tommy about how her father used her as bait to entrap The Hood. Tommy disapproves of her meeting the Hood, saying that even if he has helped her, he's still a killer. He says he can sympathize with her over the fact that someone close to her has been lying. The next morning, Cyrus is watching a news report on the failed sting against The Hood when Vivian informs him of a hot tip she received from their mole in the police department: they can use Laurel as bait to bring The Hood to them.

Tommy visits Oliver at the manor and tells him what happened with Laurel. Oliver is surprised that Laurel is lying to Tommy, and Tommy points out that Laurel has always been intrigued by bad boys like The Hood. Trying to reassure his friend, Oliver tells Tommy to fix things with Laurel before it's too late.

The commando tells Oliver that he has been working with Yao Fei for months, trying to find a way off the island. They found the airfield but Yao Fei was compromised and forced to work with Fyers. The man then gives Oliver a ninjato and admits that he'll need someone to help him take the airfield now that Yao Fei is gone. However, if Oliver is supposed to have his back, he needs to make sure he can cover it. The two spar, with Oliver being easily overpowered. Oliver insists that he's no soldier and that he only killed the mercenary by accident, and he ran when Yao Fei told him to. Disgusted, the man knocks him unconscious with one punch.

Laurel is leaving a message of apology for Tommy when someone knocks at her door. When she answers it, two of Cyrus' men break in. Laurel manages to fend them both off and runs for the door, only for Cyrus to step in and taser her unconscious.

Diggle drops off Moira at who she claims is her accountant. Once she goes inside, Diggle follows her and sneaks into a supply closet next to the office. Using a listening device, Diggle overhears Moira talking to Malcolm Merlyn, telling him that she's made sure that Carl Ballard won't interfere with ""the undertaking."" Malcolm then tells Moira to get rid of the wreckage of Robert's yacht, saying that there's no need to look for evidence of sabotage even though Moira is sure that it happened. Malcolm's bodyguard comes into the closet and sees Diggle, and asks what he's doing there. Diggle claims that he was looking for a place to smoke and shows him the cigarette lighter that he substituted for the listening device.

When Tommy returns to the apartment, he finds it in disarray and discovers The Hood's transmitter arrow stuck in the wall. He takes it to Quentin and they play back a recording of Cyrus telling them to send The Hood to meet with him. Quentin realizes that only someone in the squad could have overheard his earlier conversation with Laurel about The Hood and her connection to the vigilante. He tells Tommy that he can't trust his own men and says that he has to make a call.

Diggle plays Oliver the recording of the conversation between Moira and Malcolm, and Oliver is shocked that the accident with the yacht was no accident. However, he insists that Moira couldn't have been involved. Diggle doesn't believe it and figures that the recording shows that she's involved, but they're interrupted when Quentin calls on the cell phone. He asks The Hood to help him since Vanch kidnapped Laurel.

Oliver awakens to find that he has been tied to a chair. The commando reiterates that he needs someone else to help him retake the airfield, but Oliver is too weak to be of any use to him. He now plans to kill Oliver so he can't be captured and reveal his location to Fyers. Oliver finally injures his hands to pull himself free of the ropes and then punches his captor. Surprised and impressed, the man introduces him as Slade Wilson and says that Oliver might have some fight in him after all.

The Hood meets Quentin on a roof and the detective admits that he hates everything that the vigilante stands for. However, because there is a security leak in the precinct, he has no one else to turn to. The Hood admits that Vanch's mansion is too heavily fortified to take on alone, and tells Quentin that he'll have to help him.

At the home, Vanch tells Laurel that her time is running out and that he has trained men placed around the house. He's unaware that The Hood is already on the grounds, taking out the men in ones and twos. Meanwhile, Vanch tells Laurel that he's confirmed that The Hood always carries 24 arrows and flechettes... and he has 25 men armed with automatic weapons. A guard captures The Hood when he runs out of weapons and brings him to Vanch. Vanch orders his man to kill the vigilante, but Quentin arrives, kills the last man, and prepares to shoot Vanch. Oliver reminds him that he's a cop, not a vigilante, and Quentin gets control of himself and punches Vanch out while the vigilante slips away.

Quentin takes Laurel back to the station and makes sure that she's okay, and then offers to drive her home. His daughter refuses, saying that she doesn't want to be around him as long as she can't trust him. As Laurel goes to her car, The Hood steps out and asks if she's okay. She says that she is and that her father has the phone back. Laurel assures the vigilante that she knew the risk, but Oliver refuses to let her take them. As Tommy runs up, Oliver slips into the shadows. Relieved that she's alive and unharmed, Tommy hugs Laurel and assures her that nothing else matters as long as she's okay.

Slade warns Oliver that he'll kill him if he ruins his escape attempt, but Oliver points out that if he's dead then Slade will have nobody else to help him. When he asks what they should do next, Slade tells him to pick out a weapon from his supplies. When Oliver goes through them, he finds the black-orange Deathstroke mask and assumes that Slade was the man who tortured him. Slade reveals that he is a member of Team 7, an elite division of the Australian Special Forces, hence the unique mask design. He and a partner were sent to the island to extract Yao Fei, but the partner ended up going rogue. It was this ex-partner, not Slade, that tortured Oliver and captured Yao Fei.

Oliver reviews Diggle's recording and is devastated to learn of Moira's complicity in his father's death. Diggle suggests that blind trust can be dangerous and they figure that they need to know what ""the undertaking"" is and how Moira is involved. Oliver suits up and says that he's going to talk with his mother.

Moira is holding a meeting in her office when The Hood swings in through the window and takes out the guards. He then turns to Moira, accuses her of failing the city."

In the building parking garage, Felicity starts her car and finds Queen waiting for her. He asks her to take him to his hideout. Digs begins to work on Queen with her help.

We flashback to Wilson on the island training Queen in hand to hand combat. Queen is struggling. Later Wilson shows him a map of the island. The airstrip is heavily guarded, but the biggest issue is a guard tower with bulletproof glass. It will Queen's job to take out the sniper. The next day Queen ends up stepping on a mine. Just as they're discussing whether Wilson can disarm it, several soldiers head towards them. Wilson leaves him and Queen pretends to be one of the soldiers. Wilson returns and takes out the soldiers, placing one of them on top of the mine so Queen can escape.

Elsewhere on the island Fyers asks Fei to help him train some new arrivals.

That night Queen tells Wilson about Laurel and his infidelity. Wilson says the man who tortured him used be his partner. His name was Billy and he was the godfather to Wilson's son. Regardless, Billy turned his back on him in favor of Fyers.

Queen and Wilson arrive at the airstrip.

Back in present day Digs stitches up Queen. He seems to think Queen will be okay. She tells him she suspected all along that Queen was Arrow.

Back to the flashback: As Wilson takes out guards Queen makes his way to the tower. The guard gets the jump on Queen and has him at gunpoint.

In present day Queen begins to take a turn for the worse. Digs has to shock him back to life.

Wilson shows up at the last minute to save Queen before the guard can make a phone call. Queen's job is to stay in the tower and not let anybody inside. After Wilson leaves Queen picks up the phone and places a call to Laurel. He hears her voice a few times but cannot say anything. Just then, Wilson appears and smashes the phone in case it is being monitored. Queen is able to help them with a phone verification code. Wilson tells Queen he'll be ordering an air strike. Queen says he's tired of thinking only of himself and refuses to let Fei die. Wilson gives him three hours to return or he'll leave without him.

Digs tells Felicity about having to protect a warlord when he was in the military. In an ensuing firefight he ended up killing a teenager.

Back on the island Queen finds Fei in a tent and tells him they have a way off the island. Fei won't leave, saying the reason is a ""who."" Fyers walks in and Fei knocks Queen out.

We see Wilson tell the plane it is clear to land.

Fyers tries to figure out why Queen would return. Queen asks whether he'll be fighting Fei again and is told he is to be executed. Billy starts beating Queen, who tells the hooded man he knows who he used to be. At this point arrives and gets into a fight with Billy. Wilson kills his former friend, but moments later is shot by Fyers. Queen helps the two escape just as the plane leaves.

Back at Wilson's hideout they talk about the next step. Wilson thinks Queen has progressed and they might have a chance of surviving.

Fyers speaks with his boss over a phone and assures him the complications won't be a problem. Fei walks up and is told he has five minutes. We see that his daughter has been captured. She is the reason he's been loyal to Fyers.

In present day Queen wakes up. Using some new computers she's brought in Felicity manages to hack the police crime lab and order Queen's blood sample destroyed. She isn't going to join them, per say, but wants to help find Walter. She leaves for the bathroom and Digs says he's worried about being able to protect Felicity. On top of all that, Digs says that he's still not sure what Moira is hiding or how much she's involved with the book with the names. Queen (still in denial that his own mother is involved in the dissapearance of Walter as well as the book with names and the sabotage of his father's yacht) makes it clear that his mother is off limits, at least until they learn more.

Queen returns home and is informed by Detective Lance and his family that his mother was attacked by the vigilante. After Lance leaves, Queen embraces Moria and assures her that the vigilante will never come after her again."

Felicity is concerned by Queen's decisions with regard to going after people on the list.

We flash to the island and Queen bringing water to Wilson whose bullet wound is getting infected. Queen remembers some herbs Fei had in the cave that ""healed everything."" He leaves to get them.

Moira meets with an old friend named Frank. She tells him wants to get out of the undertaking. The two of them began the undertaking to fix the city and have seen it get away from them. He seems to agree.

Digs expresses concern about Felicity to Digs. Felicity walks in and Queen tries to put her at ease about his Arrow process. A news report talks about a criminal named the Dodger who steals using explosive collars. Queen asks Felicity to help them take him down.

We see what appears to be the Dodger (James Callis) attempting to move his latest theft. The man attempts to rob Dodger, who promptly takes out his men and shoots him in the head.

Queen, Digs and Felicity talk about how to approach the Dodger. Felicity asks about Carly, who is waiting on them. This leads to Digs agreeing to ask Carly on a date if Queen asks out McKenna Hall. Felicity suggests they bug Hall's phone in order to find out what the police know about the Dodger. Digs awkwardly asks Carly out and she seems 100 percent into the idea. They agree to dinner that night.

Laurel and Thea get mugged. The guy gets Thea's purse but a piece of his wallet chain gets snagged on a fence.

Queen plants a bug on Hall's cell phone when she steps away from her desk. He then asks if she wants to have dinner with him. She is free that night.

We flashback to the island. Queen grabs the herbs and then turns around to find a badly beaten man stumble into the cave. He says: ""help me.""

Queen and Digs listen to a conversation where Hall talks about the man we saw the Dodger murder. Felicity finds out online that he was probably a potential fence.

Thea is striking out trying to track down information about the wallet. A nervous Queen tells her he has a date. Thea is surprised to get a call back about a possible suspect and calls Laurel with a name, Roy Harper.

During Digs and Carly's date he accidentally brings up his brother and she wonders if perhaps the whole thing is too complicated.

During their date Hall starts grilling Queen about the island. She points out that those years must have changed him and he agrees. Hall is called away from dinner for work. Queen calls Felicity and has her activate the bug on Hal's phone.

Back in our flashback the beaten man tells Queen he's an exchange student who got lost during a fishing trip with his class. He tells a suspicious Queen he was the only one who made it and that he was beaten by soldiers.

While Dodger shows the jewel to a new fence the Hall and her team police raid the building. Dodger gets out of the building but runs into Arrow outside. Just as Arrow begins to chase him he sets off an explosive that allows him to escape.

Queen has Felicity search for the type of antiquity Dodger prefers. There is a fundraising auction the following night for the Starling City Cancer Society Queen thinks they could use to lure him out.

Lance questions Harper with Laurel and Thea watching through the one-way glass. Harper says his mother was hooked on Vertigo and is no longer the same, medically. He's been stealing to try and get on top of her medical bills. Thea thinks they should let him go.

Frank tells Moira he's arranged a meeting for her.

Felicity has put a GPS device in the Queen family's broach they've donated as bait. Felicity sees the broach is on the move and stops the Dodger who has it in his pocket. He says he's going to take the item. A few moments later Felicity approaches the guy with one of the explosive collars around her neck. She says ""I think we have a problem."" The Dodger told her if she calls the police it will go off. Digs works on deactivating the device while Queen leaves to track the Dodger.

Queen steals a motorcycle and speeds off, with Felicity guiding him via the GPS. Queen catches up to the Dodger's car and fires something into a rear tire which forces the vehicle to flip. The Dodger gets out holding a remote for the device around Felicity's neck. He says if Queen touches him, she'll die. Queen quickly severs his median nerve and takes it from him. Almost simultaneously Digs disarms and removes the explosive.

Back in the flashback the beaten man demands Queen untie him. Queen agrees and has him turn around. Queen puts his knife to the ropes, then stops. He says he can't do it because he doesn't know who the man is, then leaves him.

Digs tells Carly he's having a tough time with dating and she thinks perhaps he's thinking too much. He agrees and kisses her.

Thea pays Harper a visit at his home. He knows all about her bio. He gives her back her purse and before she leaves tells her she shouldn't fall for every sob story somebody like him tells the cops.

Queen tells Hall that when she talked to him about the island it reminded him of hard decisions he had to make. He wonders if he's worthy of actually being with anyone. This of course leads to them kissing and her telling him ""you are."" Lance stops by her desks and says she wants him to help him on the vigilante investigation.

Back to our flashback. Queen returns to Wilson, who asks him if he got into any trouble. ""No,"" Queen responds. ""Not a bit.""

Queen and Hall stop by Tommy's for a birthday dinner with Laurel. Malcolm (John Barrowman) stops by unannounced with a present for Tommy in a Tiffany box. Tommy asks for time alone with his father and they walk into the hall. Malcolm is receiving an award and wants Tommy to be there. Tommy says he isn't interested and hands him back the invitation.

We see the Triad leader (Kelly Hu) asking Deadshot if he'll come out of retirement and kill Malcolm for her. He references his eye not being ""what it used to be"" and she hands him a device that will correct his vision.

Malcolm tells Queen Consolidated's board that his plan is almost to fruition. Moira says they are with him.

Felicity finds out the last number the Barrera dialed is a restaurant in Chinatown. Queen and Tommy go to the restaurant for dinner. They talk about Malcolm and Tommy says Queen's father was more of a dad to him than his father. Queen excuses himself and walks to the back where some mafia business is taking place, shutting down the lights and knocking one of the men out. One of the guys tells Queen (who speaks in perfect Chinese) the hit is supposed to take place the following day.

Malcolm has been nicked and Deadshot is using his trademark poison bullets. Arrow tries to explain to Tommy what is happening to his father, but Tommy doesn't trust him. Arrow is forced to reveal his true identity to his friend and then help with a life-saving blood transfusion.

Afterwards Lance and Hall asks Tommy why he listened to the Hood. Tommy says he has no idea who the masked man really is.

In the flashback Wilson realizes that Queen has the radio tuned to the soldier's channel. They hear Fyers talking to his off-island benefactor and hear a reference to Scylla, a monster from the Odyssey. Wilson wants to meet this monster.

Queen tells Digs about Deadshot being the reason Malcolm is in the hospital. Digs is upset that his brother's killer is still alive.

Hall arrives at the same time and is told to wait for back-up. Helena tells Arrow she knows he won't shoot because he isn't a murderer. He says he has no choice because she plans to kill people and shoot an arrow at her chest. She catches and seems hurt he would have actually killed her. They begin to fight and Arrow gets the upper hand. But as he points his bow at Helena, Hall approaches from behind and orders him to put down the weapon. Helena uses the distraction to shoot Hall.

After close Lance tells Queen and Tommy a girl was mugged a few blocks from their club. She had one of their wristbands on and a Vertigo pill on her. Tommy wonders whether or not The Count is still in action.

Lance pays the Count a visit in his mental hospital. Just before he get to the room Arrow drops in and asks where the drugs are coming from.

We flash back to the island and Fei's daughter working out with Wilson. Queen wants to know what their plan is going forward.

Digs is distracted.

Queen shows Digs that the city has been inundated with a new, more dangerous version of Vertigo. Since The Count was the only person who knew the formula for the drug, he's not sure what to think. They see a news report that The Count has just escaped.

The doctor tells Lance that The Count tricked him, pretending to be out of it for months. Lance is told the girl who died the other night texted Tommy before she died. There's also money suspiciously missing from Tommy bank account.

Digs goes undercover to buy some Vertigo, paying with ""trackable"" money.

Lance pays Tommy a visit asking about the dead girl. Tommy looks down and sees he got a text from her that read ""Can you hook me up?"" Lance asks whether he's involved in drugs and Laurel tells Tommy not to answer.

Fei's daughter is training Queen by getting him to hit a bowl of water.

Queen and Felicity trace Digs' cash. A mid-level dealer sells to some degenerates with an unseen boss in a car. Arrow breaks up the meeting but the boss gets away.

One of the guys who just bought some Vertigo starts losing it at the aquarium. He takes some hostages.

Felicity and Queen figure out what's happening at the aquarium. Queen tells her to get in touch with Digs.

Digs ignores his phone while meeting with an old army buddy named Lyla. He's asking for Dead Shot's real name and gives her some information on his targets.

Lance continues to ask Tommy questions. Tommy isn't cooperating.

Arrow stops the druggie at the aquarium. But he dies before he can answer any questions.

Fei's daughter tells Queen her father was a general in the army. She thinks Fyers wants to make Fei a scapegoat. The Chinese government screwed him over and she spent years looking for him, eventually being dumped on the island as well.

Lance arrives at Tommy's club with a search warrant. His probable cause is the fact Tommy paid off a city employee to speed up the inspection process. Lance wants them to open up a locked door, the Arrow HQ. Lance goes inside and finds nothing more than storage.

After Lance leaves Tommy and Queen argue over whether Queen actually thought his friend was involved in drugs. Digs shows up and Queen is furious he didn't answer his call. They argue over whether Digs should be searching for his brother's killer on his own time.

It turns out the guy at the aquarium died of an allergic reaction to an anti-psychotic. Ditto the girls from Tommy's club. The Count was using medication he could get at the hospital to make his new batch. Queen wonders if perhaps The Count faked his escape and is actually still at the institution.

Arrow arrives at the institution and finds The Count lying in a bed connected to a bunch of wires. A large man sneaks up from behind Arrow and knocks him out. It looks as if The Count's doctor is behind all of this.

Queen wakes up to find himself strapped into a bed. The doc says he reversed engineered the drug using The Count's liver. He did it for the money. Queen is forced to drink some of the Vertigo, but manages to detonate an explosive arrow. Digs comes in at this point and helps save the day while Queen injects himself with an antidote. The doctor comes at Queen and he shoots him with an arrow. Arrow decides against killing the completely crazy Count.

Queen apologizes to Tommy. Tommy doesn't like being a front for Arrow any longer and quits.

Back on the island Fei's daughter shows Queen what the training was building towards. He's now strong enough to draw a bow. Teaching him to shoot will be next.

Laurel finds her father at a bar drinking a soda. The drugs the dead girls got did not come from Tommy and he's worried he might have screwed things up with Laurel. She says they're okay and is happy he didn't turn to the bottle.

Queen thanks Digs for having his back. He says not killing The Count is a sign he's changing. Queen shows Digs he's found Deadshot. ""Were do we start,"" says Digs.

After five minutes the dialogue kicks back on in the middle of a conversation between Queen and Laurel. She's about to prep married couple Eric and Nancy for a deposition. They are going after dirty financial investor Edward Rasmus, who stole their future.

Later that night we see one of Rasmus' henchmen enter the couple's home and shoot Eric and Nancy. Their young son Taylor escapes. Queen sees news of the murder (and Taylor's escape) on TV.

Laurel is convinced Rasmus is behind the murder. Instead of letting Taylor be placed with children's services she offers to let the boy stay with her. Tommy learns that Queen and Laurel recently had lunch.

We return to an island flashback where Fei's daughter is teaching Queen to shoot arrows. Romance may be budding.

Queen, Digs, and Felicity talk about a plot to capture Deadshot. Digs doesn't want him captures. Queen tells them about Rasmus and Taylor. Felicity is tasked with finding a link between Rasmus and the murders.

Roy tells Lance he wants to see the vigilante brought to justice.

Tommy helps Taylor feel comfortable. There is a knock on the door. It's Rasus' henchman and Laurel recognizes his badge is fake. He shoots his way inside and is eventually chased off by Arrow.

Lance arrives to assess the scene at Laurel's place. Tommy suggests staying with the Queen's might be the best move.

Tommy and Laurel bring Taylor to Queen's place. Queen leaves and Tommy isn't happy about the fact.

Roy and Thea have dinner together. He hears something about the vigilante on a scanner in his pocket and leaves the table. It turns out the scanner was Lance's radio and he planted the call to get it back. Roy is placed under arrest.

Deadshot opens fire. He hits the woman Digs was working for. Digs battles with Deadshot in the stairwell, but Deadshot gets the upper hand. He says he'd kill him but nobody is paying him to do it and taunts Digs about having killed his brother.

Felicity patches up Digs. Queen returns and tells him about Rasmus. Digs is furious because Deadshot killed several agents. He thinks once again Queen chose Laurel over everybody else.

Back to the island and Queen's shooting lessons. The two kiss.

Moira and Laurel talk about the latter's history with Queen. Queen walks in and tells Laurel that Rasmus has been arrested and confessed with help from the vigilante. A decision is made that Tommy and Laurel should stay with the Queens.

Rasmus meets with his assassin. Despite Rasmus' plea to leave Taylor alone, the man says he cannot. He kills Rasmus and leaves.

As a warning not to trust him, Lance shows Roy and Thea one of the bodies attributed to the vigilante.

Laurel tells Queen that she's noticed he's definitely changed since he's been home. They hug and Tommy spots this.

Rasmus' assassin manages to get into the Queen's home. He uses a remote explosive to cut the power. The assassin kills several of Queen's guards as he looks for Taylor. Queen and the man fight, with Queen eventually killing him via a poker through the chest.

Tommy asks Queen whether he still loves Laurel. Queen says it doesn't matter because of his lifestyle. Tommy thinks if Laurel ever found out who Queen really is she would choose him.

Tommy tells Laurel he's moving out. He's not ready for the kind of commitment she's looking for. She asks why and he says that the other night made him realize he doesn't really want her.

Roy tells Thea he owes ""everything"" to the vigilante. He thinks their lives are connected. She agrees to help him find the vigilante.

Digs tells Queen ""we're done"" and walks out. This lead to yet another island flashback. Fei shows up at Queen's camp with Fyers' men and tells Queen his time on the island is ""at an end."""

Queen isn't interested in taking the first step to repair the relationship.

We are six months into Walter's disappearance. While talking to Thea, Moira has a flashback to a meeting at their home before the stock offering. During the meeting Malcolm tells everybody that what they've been doing to fix the Glades hasn't been working. His plan is to destroy the Glades in order to completely rebuild. He tells them of a company called Unidac Industries, which is five years away from a project that could help them create a natural disaster.

Queen advises Laurel to talk to Tommy and ""be honest."" Felicity walks in with news for Queen.

Felicity has hacked King Fidelity. It looks like one of his clients was paid $2 million to kidnap Walter. The money points to a Dominic Alonzo, who runs the biggest underground casino in town. He also has a history of kidnapping. Queen thinks the only way is to access Alonzo's computer inside his casino. Felicity demands she be given the chance to pull it off.

Another flashback. Robert tells Malcolm he doesn't like his idea. Malcolm remembers the death of his wife Rebecca, who was killed in the Glades.

Felicity drops by Diggs' place and asks him to come back and help them with their lead on Walter. She tells him that Queen needs him, but Diggs says he's waiting to hear it from Queen himself.

Laurel pays Tommy a visit at his office. She thinks they should face their problems together and wants some honesty. He tells her she ""belongs with Oliver.""

Queen and Felicity go to Alonzo's casino, with the plan being her to get caught counting cards, get a warning from management and gain access to the system. She goes inside alone and has Queen speaking to her in her ear.

Moira meets with Malcolm, who has news for her. He says the Markov device passed its beta test and is on its way to the city. He thanks her for her support and mentioned ""your and I will always have a connection."" He apologizes for taking Robert from her, but she takes credit for his death.

Another flashback. Robert tells Moira about Malcolm's plan to destroy the Glades. He says she doesn't know who he really is and tells her a story about accidentally killing a Glades politician when he asked for a bribe. Moira makes him promise he won't let it happen.

Felicity is crushing the blackjack table. A security guard brings her to see Alonzo. He kicks her out, but she manages to plant a device on his computer. He spots her ear piece and smashes it on the ground. This leads to Arrow bursting into the casino and fighting his way to Alonzo's office. Alonzo tells Arrow he heard the gunshot that killed Walter.

Queen tells Moira and Thea he heard from one of Diggs' army buddies who has a connection with the FBI that Walter is dead. Moira says she needs to leave and walks out. Thea weeps in Queen's arms.

Another flashback. Robert tells Frank he thinks there is an option besides killing thousands of people. Using a company called Sagittarius he has purchased about a third of the Glades. If they can purchase the rest Malcolm won't have the leverage needed to make his project work. Also in the flashback Laurel talks to Queen about wanting to move their relationship forward by living together. He likes the idea.

In present day a furious Moira yells at him for breaking his word about Walter still being alive. He shows her a closed caption camera shot of Walter. He then talks about their agreement and both being ""in this together"" and we see that Arrow has been listening to the entire thing.

Felicity returns to HQ to find Queen sitting by himself. He tells her that Walter's is actually alive and asks her to look at Malcolm's phone records. The call he made when Moira was in his office was to a housing project guarded by three men.

Arrow parachutes onto the roof of the house where Walter is being held. He takes out about ten guards and enters Walter's room. He disguises his voice and tells Walter ""you're going home.""

Walter is reunited with Moira, Thea and Queen at the hospital.

We have a flash back of Robert saying good-bye to Moira before leaving on his boat. Queen is a last-minute addition to the trip. Laurel stops by to good-bye to Queen and brings him a picture of him. This is all while Queen is arranging for her sister to join him on the trip. We see that Malcolm and Frank were behind the Queen's Gambit going down.

In present day Malcolm stops by the hospital asking about Walter. Queen has to bite his lip as Malcolm asks if Walter has said anything about his kidnappers. Laurel drops by looking a little flustered. She tells him about what Tommy said. She wants him to say he's not still in love with her. He says he can't, ""because it wouldn't be true."" Laurel gasps.

Queen stops by to see Diggs and apologizes. He tells him about Moira working with Malcolm and says he needs Diggs' help to stop whatever it is they're working on."

Laurel tells Queen she's confused by him telling her he still has feelings for her. She wonders out loud if perhaps she still has feelings for him. He tells her nothing has changed.

Walter is back home. Thea notices he doesn't yet seem like himself.

Moira sees a news report about the massacre at Unidac, and that one of those killed was a world-renowned seismologist.

We see an island flashback. Fei tells everybody that Feyers was about to fire bomb the entire forest. Queen hears them talking about the fact a commercial airliner will be flying overhead in 25 minutes. Fyers' plan is to destroy it.

At the massacre scene Lance realizes that another copycat archer is behind what happened. Nobody who has any idea what was being worked on there is still alive.

Roy and Thea watch the building from a car parked across the street. Roy is still working on finding the vigilante. Roy has an idea for a way Thea can help him get info from the police.

Queen asks Moira who took Walter. He asks her to ""let me help you, before you drown."" The lights go out and they are both hit in the neck with tranquilizers.

Queen and Moira wake up tied to chairs.

Back in an island flashback Fyers tells us ""my employer's"" goal is to destabilize the Chinese economy by shutting down air travel. He's going to need Fei's (a rogue element from the Chinese military) help by taking responsibility for the attacks. Fei says no and Fyers starts shooting people.

Thea goes to the station and asks for case files on behalf of Laurel's firm. She has a court order. She overhears Lance talking about the ""copycat"" and the connection to Merlyn Global.

A hooded archer demands to know what is being planned. After knocking Queen around Moira admits the plan to level the Glades with an artificially created earthquake. Moira says there is no way to stop the process at this point. The archer (who looked a lot like Digs) unties their hands and leaves.

Queen, Digs and Felicity come together after the mission. Queen has Felicity look into Unidac and he tells her about the plan. They figure out the copycat is connected to Merlyn Global.

Back on the island we see that Fei goes along with Fyers' plan. Fyers makes a call that ""it's happening,"" and we see the person is charge is a woman.

Moira walks in on Walter speaking with Malcolm. When Walter leaves the room she wonders angrily why Malcolm is there.

Tommy comes down to the station to speak with Lance as a representative of Merlyn. Laurel walks in as he is leaving. Lance is going to look into getting a warrant to look into Merlyn's computer records. Laurel tells her father about Queen being back in the picture.

Felicity can't get into Merlyn's system remotely. Queen wants to get her access to the company's headquarters.

Queen and Digs help Felicity sneak into Merlyn as someone making a delivery. Queen and Felicity use the elevator shaft to get to the mainframe on the 25th floor. Queen leaves for a meeting with Tommy, giving Felicity time to hack.

Queen speaks with Tommy about Laurel. Queen reminds Tommy that he can't be with Laurel, ""and you know why."" Queen says he didn't come between the two of them. Felicity is about to have security burst in on her before she can finish her download. She finishes her download but runs right into a security guard. Before Queen can help her he runs into his sister in the lobby. Digs, who has been posing as a security guard, runs upstairs and helps Felicity at the last moment. Thea tells Queen about Roy and the copycat archer. Queen warns Roy to stay away from the hood.

Roy tells Thea he isn't interested in Queen's opinion, calling Queen ""a wimp."" He wants the hood to teach him so he won't lose anybody else in his life.

Walter tells Moira he's fileing for divorce. He's well aware of her role in his captivity. Thea walks in the door and asks why Walter's leaving.

Lance's IT guy can't hack Merlyn's system, but found out that Felicity was doing the same thing he was. Lance now wants to know who she is.

Felicity thinks she should be able to locate the device, but it's going to take some time. Queen thinks Malcolm's plan is what he returned from the island to stop.

Queen pays Laurel a visit and hints that there might be a future for them on the horizon. They kiss and start tearing each other's clothes off. Tommy sees this from the street.

Later that night Digs calls Queen with word they've located the device in the Glades.

Back in the island flashback Fei records a video taking responsibility for shooting down the plane. Immediately afterwards Fyers shoots Fei in the head.

Arrow pays Malcolm a visit, telling him the ""undertaking ends now."" Digs tells him through an earpiece that the device has been moved. Malcolm tells Arrow he figures out somebody was in his system and took precautions. Malcolm says nothing can be done to stop his plan. The two get into a huge fight. Malcolm knocks Arrow out, then pulls back the hood and sees it's Queen. ""Oh no,"" he says."

Tommy confronts Queen about kissing Laurel. Queen tells him about their fathers' plan to destroy the Glades. Tommy doesn't want to believe what Queen's saying about Malcolm.

Flash back to the island: Queen is able to reprogram the missile at the last second. It misses the plan and turns around, leveling Fyers' camp.

Present day: Lance tells a superior about the vigilante's intel related to the Glades and Unidac. He is promptly suspended.

Queen tells Moira they need to stop what is happening. He says he's spoken to Malcolm. Queen tells Moira that Robert, after killing the other shipwreck survivor, killed himself when they were on the life raft. They need to figure out the location of the quake device, he says. Malcolm calls Moira and says he's accelerated the timetable, the operation will be taking place that night.

Laurel shows up at Queen's place and asks where they are and if she should be worried about history repeating itself. He reassures her that things are different and she is all that matters. He asks her to stay out of the Glades.

Malcolm tells Tommy that what he's heard about the Glades is true. He plays for Tommy the voicemail from the night his mother died. Malcolm yells that everyone there deserves to die the way she died.

Felicity thinks the device must be underground near a fault that runs under the Glades. Queen thinks he knows where it is. Thea calls Queen to tell him Moira is holding a press conference. Queen turns on the TV and sees his mother confess to a five-year plan (""the undertaking"") related to destroying the Glades. She says the architect is Malcolm and she has proof he's killed to keep the plan moving forward. She tells everyone in the Glades they need to leave immediately. A tearful Thea tells Moira she can't leave Roy there.

Malcolm confirms for Tommy that he killed people. Malcolm opens a safe and reveals his costume. Malcolm takes out several police officers and knocks Tommy unconscious when he tries to stop him.

The plan is for Diggs to find the quake device and for Queen to go after Malcolm. Instead Diggs wants to join him in the fight. Felicity is charged with deactivating the device. Arrow tells Lance he knows where the device is located, the subway station where Malcolm's wife was killed. He wants Lance to help Felicity.

The Glades is in complete chaos as people attempt to leave. Lance heads into the subway.

Queen and Diggs just miss Malcolm at his office. This leads to an island flashback. After the missile dust settles Queen finds a bow and arrow in a box. Fyers walks up with a gun to Shado's head, using her as a shield. Fyers orders Queen to surrender. Instead Queen puts an arrow in Fyers' head.

Arrow and Malcolm fight.

Lance cuts a wire, but all that does is accelerate the timer. It's now at two minutes and Lance thinks they won't be able to stop it. He calls Laurel and tells her to get out. Lance says he won't make it and make her promise to go on with her life. He tells her he loves her and hangs up. Felicity begins to give her more instructions.

Roy stops to help people trapped in a bus on their way out of town. They kiss and Thea leaves.

Arrow gets caught in a chokehold and it seems he's not going to make it. Arrow is able to grab an arrow and stick it into himself and Malcolm behind him.

With only seconds to spare Felicity helps Lance stop the device. She calls and gives Queen the good news. But just as Malcolm dies he tells Queen there is another device.

The second device goes off. Queen and Diggs watch as the Glades begin to crumble.

Pete Martell (Jack Nance) leaves home to go fishing. Before he arrives to his destination, he notices a bundle of plastic in the riverside. Immediately, he phones Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) through the nosy phone operator, Lucy Morgan (Kimmy Robertson). Harry is the sheriff of the town, and he immediately tends to the crime. There, the photographer, deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) is crying while taking the photos of the corpse so the coroner has to take charge of the task. When they finally turn the body over, they see it's seventeen-year-old Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee).

Back at home, Laura's mother, Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie) is calling out for Laura, but of course she's not there. Sarah phones several people asking for her whereabouts. Harry visits Laura's father, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) who is trying to sell property to some foreign visitors. Sarah realises that ""her baby"", as she calls Laura, is dead when Leland says that Harry is looking for him.

At the local café, Double R, Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) teases a co-worker who is being picked up by her secret lover. When the couple leave together they see a police car in the opposite direction. They both feel terrified when they watch the huge lorry. Back at the police station, Leland has to identify the body of his dead child.

Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) arrives to high school acting all cocky. He is Laura's boyfriend and is immediately summoned to be questioned. Laura's classmates react in different ways to her death: Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) cries sincerely but Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) seems not to care much. Bobby is the main suspect as he didn't go to football practice that day, and nobody saw Laura after Bobby left her. The principal announces through the loudspeakers to all the high school that Laura is dead and ask students to come forward if they know what Laura did after classes yesterday. Bobby says that he loved her, and that he's innocent.

Laura's diary is found. The mother remembers Laura talking on the phone, but she can't be sure of what time it was. Another girl hasn't come back home. Katherine Martell (Piper Laurie) doesn't want Jocelyn Packard (Joan Chen) to stop the sawmill for the day because of the death of Laura and the disappearance of Pulaski's daughter. Pete finally obeys Jocelyn. That other girl Ronnette ""Rony"" Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine) appears half-naked, walking numbly with the remains of rope around her wrists. She looks horrible.

Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) arrives to Twin Peaks. He is a weird character who is amazed by the corns of the land and is constantly talking to some ""Diane"" in his speakerphone -- or is that a tape recorder (it is unclear). The coroner hasn't prepared the report on the second girl, who is at hospital from exposure. The girl is not responding at all, so Cooper watches her fingernails closely. A psychiatrist, Dr. Lawrence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn) doesn't want Cooper or Truman to tell Laura's parents that she was watching him. Cooper finds something deep under one of Laura's fingernails. It is a very small square letter ""R.""

Big Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) shows Donna a handwritten note saying ""Meet me at the roadhouse after 9:30"". Donna was Laura's best friend. Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) wants Donna only to console him. Cooper read Laura's diary: there is a person with a ""J"" mentioned. The last day Laura wrote about a key to a deposit box within an envelope and pasted that key into the diary. The envelope had some white powder on it. Cooper says that it's a reference to cocaine, but Harry says that Laura wasn't that kind of girl. Cooper shows a video found at Laura's room. Bobby says that he quarrelled with Laura, but he didn't kill her. Laura appears in the video exhilarating, happy, half-dancing. Bobby says that he doesn't know who she was seeing. Cooper replies that he didn't love her anyway.

Audrey is really pissed off for all the attention to Laura, even in her death. She interrupts the symposium for the sale of property, and everybody looks at her. Bobby is furious and he blames some mysterious biker, and he threatens to bust open that biker's head. Bobby is released by his rich parents. Laura and Donna had gone on a picnic on their own, but somebody had to take the pictures. Donna says it was a female backpacker. Cooper thinks that Donna is protecting the mysterious ""J"". In the recording of Laura, in one of her eyes, there is a reflection of part of a Harley Davidson motorbike which Cooper has found out. Meanwhile, Audrey is happy because she has spoilt the business of her father Benjamin Horne.

Cooper and Truman find half of a necklace with a gold heart, some bloody remains and a scrap of paper in which it was written with blood ""Fire Walk with Me"". James Hurley (James Marshall) looks at the other half of a gold heart necklace similar to that. At the deposit box, Cooper and Truman find 10,000 dollars and the magazine Flesh World . Ronnette Pulaski and the lorry from which the two coffee goers were afraid of also appears in the magazine.

Leo Johnson (Eric DaRe) is jealous of Shelley Johnson (Mädchen Amick) because of some different-branded cigarette butts. Cooper and Truman give a public speech. Dwayne Milford (John Boylan) stummers in the mic. Cooper says that Laura was the second and Ronnette the third victim of a killer who he has been trying to catch. Meanwhile, he recommends a curfew to everybody younger than 18. Donna wants to leave home anyway and her sister Harriet (Jessica Wallenfels) will cover up for her. However, as Mike and Bobby come looking for Donna, her father realises she's not there. Both youngsters go to look for Donna to the roadhouse, while Dr. Will Hayward (Warren Frost), Donna's father, calls the police.

At the Roadhouse motel bar, Twin Peaks theme song is sung. Donna arrives. Mike and Bobby are waiting there for her. Mike frightens Donna, who gets hysterical. A bar brawl ensues, and the Biker takes Donna away from there. Donna tells James Hurley (James Marshall) that the police are looking for him. Laura said to James that she was really different to what everybody thought of her. She was afraid of somebody. Donna says that she knew Laura better than she thought, and she kisses James passionately. Donna advises James to give back the other half of the golden necklace. James and Donna bury the other half together and put a stone on top of everything. James takes Donna home. Cooper and Truman had been following James and he now stops him. When Donna says that James didn't do anything, Cooper says that she is right. In spite of that, James is put into prison, where Mike and Bobby have been imprisoned - thankfully in another cell. Donna's father doesn't tell Donna off, because he knows she did what she did for a very good reason.

Cooper asks Truman for some advice concerning an inexpensive motel, as he is going to stay around for a while. Jocelyn kisses Truman passionately and Katherine tells somebody on the phone.

Laura's mother wakes up from a nightmare. At that very same moment, the other half of Laura's necklace is taken from under the stone."

Katherine talks to her lover about her plans to get control over the Packard sawmill.

Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) is still in shock over the death of Laura when Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) goes to speak with her. First, Sarah thinks that Donna is Laura and hugs her. Then, she sees a man who stares at her and she screams hysterically. We don't know whether Ed's affirmation that his beer has been drugged has anything to do with that or no.

A one-armed (Al Strobel) man leaves the hospital. Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer) tells Audrey Horne off as she has damaged irreparably the real estate deal the Hornes had taken so long to prepare.

Special Agent Dale Cooper from the FBI (Kyle MacLachlan) tries to get some information about Lauras' addiction to cocaine from her doctor, Dr Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), who believes that many of the problems of our present society have to do with sex in one form or another. He says that Laura had many secrets, and that she would not even share them with him. Cooper says that Laura had sex with three men the night she died, and asks Jacoby if he was one of them.

He says that he was at the hospital to check on a friend. He lost his arm going from Memphis to some place in a car accident. His job is to sell shoes, so he has a suitcase full of samples.

She intends to discover who killed Laura, and Cooper will take her with him when he leaves Twin Peaks.

Bobby tells her that Leo and Jacques were smuggling drugs -cocaine- across the border, and that they were probably passing them onto Laura. Shelly decides to confide on him about the bloodied shirt of Leo Johnson's. Bobby takes the shirt, as he immediately realises that that is a huge clue. He is about to leave, but Shelly doesn't want him to go without having sex with her first, so she shows him a loaded gun.

Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) admits to Lucy that he had dropped his gun when they were looking for Gerard. Lucy is despondent and doesn't seem to care much.

Hawk passes with flying colours, but Andy is such a disaster, that Cooper orders him to have some practice an hour a day three days a week, until he knows how to use his gun well.

James Hurley, who is at the diner, cannot refrain from talking to a girl and asks who she was. It is Laura Palmer's cousin, Madeleine ""Maddy"" Ferguson (Sheryl Lee) , who has memories of visiting Laura and pretending they were sisters because of their similar looks, except for the fact that Maddy is a brunette.

She wants to help him with his family business. She wants to start from the absolute bottom and quit the idea of going to college. She wants to start at the store, in the beauty parlour, at first part time until she graduates from high school. Audrey finally changes her ways and says she wants a future for herself and her future family. Her father receives a call, and asks the person at the other side of the line to meet him discreetly.

Benjamin tells him to become more ambitious. James and Donna go to the place they buried Laura's necklace, because Donna is worried about Sarah's having those visions and watching somebody take the necklace.

Donna soothes James and they french kiss.

Sheriff Harry S. Truman phones Jocelyn Packard (Joan Chen), asking whether she was at the motel at a particular date. Jocelyn doesn't answer and hangs up because she is busy. She makes a peanut butter sandwich with the butter we've seen before. Jocelyn checks her mail when she's alone, and she finds a letter.

He asks him what he felt the first time he made love to Laura. The psychoanalyst seems to think that she laughed at him and that's why he's become so rebellious lately. Bobby says that Laura wanted to die. He remembers that she knew how wicked people may get. The psychologist tries to follow that thread and Bobby cries remembering her.

Hawk, Sheriff Harry S. Truman, Hayward and of course Dale Cooper visit the weird Log Lady (Catherine E. Coulson), who slaps Cooper's hand because he fingered the food before she served tea. She says that her husband was a logging man who saw the devil. She tells Cooper to ask the log. The Log Lady caresses the log and she says that she - the log - heard two men and two girls laughing on the woods, over the bridge, and that darkness pressed on her. Then it heard a girl. When they leave, they find an old trail. Hawk points the way. They reach an old cottage with blood stains on the floor and a broken casino chip hidden. They turn off the radio.

Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) goes to a country party with Pete Martell (Jack Nancy), who as usual is bossed around by her. Catherine throws some champagne over Ben's luxurious footwear. Audrey is watching closely, as usual. She follows her father and Catherine, and watches them through a hole on the wall. He sees Catherine slapping Ben, but then they kiss and make out while she smiles and half-laughs. Catherine mentions their plot of burning the saw mill down to its ashes and cashing on the insurance, but leaving the land available for sale as realty. Ben tells her to wait for a while as the business with the Islanders is going well. Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly), for once, looks like a good fun and responsible business man who can take care of things. However, Leeland appears to make a fool of himself, dancing on his own half drunk half hysterical. Catherine starts dancing with him to hide the fact that he's terribly damaged. The Islanders seem to think that it's a new dancing vogue. Audrey sees all these motions with disgust.

Maddy has found a tape of Laura, and calls Donna to tell her so.

Hank appears and beats Leo up. He is furious because Leo has lost the drug business they used to share. Furious, Leo hits Shelly once again, but this time she shows the gun to him. He doesn't believe she's capable of shooting him. However, this time she shoots him.

When Dale Cooper arrives to his motel room, he knows that somebody has entered his room. He opens the door and looks at Audrey with amazement.

She is naked in his room, and asks him to let her stay over."

Special FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) tries to reason with Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn): she can't stay to live with him on his hotel as it would be wrong, as he intends to follow the values he's been sworn to when he entered the FBI, and that in spite of liking her very much. He's sympathetic nevertheless, and intends to listen to whatever problems Audrey has got. She asks him whether he's got any secrets, because Laura used to have many.

Lucy Morgan (Kimmy Robertson) is doing some taks at her desk, so that she's a bit rude towards Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz), the man she is supposed to be dating. Cooper comes in and he talks about the link between Laura, violent man Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re) and the other girl who appeared walking numbly after having survived the same circumstances as Laura. The porn and hot-date magazine seems to be the link. Dr Will Hayward (Warren Frost), Deputy Tommy 'Hawk' Hill (Michael Horse) and Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) listen to him. They also realise that there is a link with the strange pub/brothel One Eyed Jacks.

Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) appears to offer some consolation to Shelly Johnson (Mädchen Amick), who recounts how she shot Leo, who in turn left home wounded and furious. Bobby offers some protection to her, but we don't know up to what point he will be able to deliver.

Madeleine 'Maddy' Ferguson - late Laura Palmer's cousin - (Sheryl Lee), rebellious biker James Hurley (James Marshall) and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) listen to the tapes Maddy has found of recorded Laura's thoughts. She speaks as in poetry, talking about her loneliness. Meanwhile, Audrey is working in exactly the same role as Laura used to have in her father -Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer)'s department store, but her real intentions is to work undercover and investigate the possible relations between the job and Laura's death. Hidden in a closet, Audrey discovers that her boss in-line Emory Battis (Don Amendolia) offers jobs to young girls in exchange of sexual favours. In fact, she listens how he subtly proposes to a girl, Jenny (Lisa Ann Cabasa), who accepts the job with its ""consequences"". Audrey tries to talk to Jenny when she is leaving.

Cooper visit Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) while working on his wife Norma (Peggy Lipton)'s diner. He pretends to be reformed in order to recover his drug business, which Leo has let go to the devil.

Jocelyn Packard (Joan Chen) is worried about Twin Peaks' sawmill. She is a bit jealous and tells Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) her suspicions about her ex-mother-in-law Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) and Ben Horne's intentions of setting fire to the sawmill. Jocelyn offers Harry some proofs this time, showing him some photographs of the lovers in a motel. Harry confides on Cooper, who decides to investigate the matter.

Audrey keeps on calling Cooper, but he's with Sheriff Harry S. Truman seeing to Jocelyn Packard's problems. Catherine is reading some documents showing that Jocelyn is the fiduciary receiver of a million dollars in case of reception of the insurance owner. Catherine understands that Ben and Josie are plotting to kill her. She refuses to sign the papers alleging that she's noticed some changes and that she should question her attorney concerning them. She tries to seduce the insurance man, Walter Neff (Mark Loventhal) who is ambitious and sees a big opportunity in servicing her in spite of all her strange conditions.

Audrey writes a letter for Cooper, as she can't contact him. Leo kills Waldo the mynah. Cooper hears the record of Waldo's voice. The law enforcers go to the One Eyed Jacks. Blackie O'Reilly (Victoria Catlin) goes directly to talk to them. She immediately realises that they are cops. They gamble, drink and record Cooper's narration of events in a recording machine watched by Hawk.

Maddy tries to leave the home where she's staying without being heard, but Leland (Ray Wise) watches her. Donna, Maddy and James meet, and James wants to talk to the now blonde Maddy leaving Donna alone. Jerry (David Patrick Kelly), Ben and the Icelandic tourists are having a party. Ben asks Jerry about Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) and he says that he will take full responsibility. Ben tells Jerry to entertain the drunk Icelandic people while he calls Jocelyn, who talks to him with Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) at her side.

Audrey goes to the One Eyed Jacks to find a job undercover. Blackie interviews her. She offers Audrey a job eventually. Meanwhile, Cooper and Big Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) enter the place undercover. Big Ed has left Nadine Hurley (Wendy Robie), his one-eyed wife, alone at home, in spite of her feelings of being a monster towards herself.

Cooper is playing blackjack and Big Ed tries to hide his face from the new croupier, Jacques Renault. James phones Dr Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn) but it's Maddy who speaks, pretending to be Laura. She tells Jacoby to go to the door, and so he goes - defending himself with a small gun. It's a video of Maddy with a blonde wig pretending to be Laura, showing the day's newspaper. Maddy thinks that Jacoby has fallen for the trick. Bobby - hidden among the bushes - watches how Donna and James leave in a motorbike, leaving Maddy on her own. Bobby also confuses her with late Laura Palmer, especially because he stares wide-eyed to her back. Dr Jacoby thinks he recognises the place where Maddy ""Laura"" is in the video, so he leaves on his car full-speed. At that moment, James and Donna enter his office, as he was Laura's psychiatric counsellor.

Jealous Bobby puts the cocaine on the deposit of James' bike and says ""say goodbye, James"".

The last shot is of Maddy disguised as Laura being approached by somebody who is hiding - probably dangerous Dr Jacoby."

They look closely and find odd things there, for example a collection of tiny umbrellas on a white jewellery box. There is also a button which turns on a radio cassette which plays different kinds of Hawaiian music. Within a coconut, they find a cassette tape and also one half of late Laura Palmer's necklace. Somebody attacks Dr Jacoby and viciously beats him. He watches in terror how James and Donna pick Madeleine 'Maddy' Ferguson (Sheryl Lee) up, with a horrible blonde wig pretending to be Laura on Dr Jacoby's behalf.

Special FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) beats Jacques Renault (Walter Ocasiez) at the casino/brothel One Eyed Jacks. Cooper rejects one of the prostitutes on the casino kindly, and gives the croupier a purple broken chip with a value of 1,000 dollars. Cooper says that he's a friend of Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re) but Jacques pretends that he's never seen Leo. Meanwhile, Blackie O'Reilly (Victoria Catlin) has given Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) her new uniform: that of a whore. Audrey is there under a false name. She gets upset when she notices Cooper is there through the surveillance screens, but she says to Blackie that there is no problem at all. She is relieved when another customer takes Cooper's place.

The conversation between Cooper and Renault is recorded by Deputy Tommy 'Hawk' Hill (Michael Horse). They talk about late Laura Palmer. Jacques tries to leave at that moment, but he stays and talks about another ""bird"" - meaning another girl - who happened to have been a friend of Laura's. Jacques explains how Leo told Laura ""bite the bullet, baby"", concerned about the broken chip. He says that Laura had been with him and Leo voluntarily.

Shelly Johnson (Mädchen Amick) is washing her hair on the sink when Leo arrives and threatens her. Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) explains that Lucy Moran (Kimmy Robertson) is not talking to him anymore. He and Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) are at the sawmill waiting for Jacques Renault. They arrest him on the charges of attempted murder of Ronnette Pulaski and murder of Laura Palmer. Andy shoots Jacques because he had taken a gun to shoot Harry. They call an ambulance.

James, Maddy and Donna listen to one more of Laura's recorded cassettes, addressed to James. She says that a mystery man may get to kill her or him if she says the name. Sex with that mystery man is weird, and she says that they use the word FIRE as a codeword for their relationships. Dr Will Hayward (Warren Frost) gets called out to tend to Jacques' emergency surgery.

Leo ties Shelly in the sawmill's drying shed and is going to burn her and the sawmill up because she has broken his heart. Nadine Hurley (Wendy Robie) attemps suicide and is preparing all the stuff she is gonna need.

Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) tries talking to Jocelyn Packard (Joan Chen) to know whether she killed her late husband. He says that they will be partners for life, and he seals the agreement with blood. Meanwile, Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) looks for some papers in her office like mad. She thinks that Peter Martell (Jack Nance) knows something about that, but he doesn't seem to trust her much. Catherine only has Pete's help, as Ben is plotting against her.

Harry treats Andy as a hero of sorts so that eccentric Lucy Moran overhears it. Andy and Lucy finally kiss each other. She tells him that she is pregnant. Andy leaves in shock, which leaves sheriff Truman and Hawk in amazement of their mutual coldness.

Meanwhile, Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) phones Lucy, accusing James Hurley (James Marshall) of hiding the cocaine he's planted on his motorbike. Lucy thinks it was Leo who accused James. Dr Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn) is at hospital, taken care by Will Hayward (Warren Frost).

At the sawmill office, Catherine and Pete are looking for some papers. Pete finds something which makes him say ""bitch"", but he says her that it was his lost yearbook. Just then, Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) phones Catherine to tell her where the papers she's looking for are. Hank is trying to talk Norma (Peggy Lipton) into loving him again. Norma's his boss at the diner and ex-wife. He talks about their old anniversary and they end up kissing each other, which leaves her really worried.

Big Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) finds his wife Nadine (Wendy Robie) on time, presumibly still breathing. He takes her to hospital immediately. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) goes to the police station to know whether they've really found Laura's murderer. They tell him that they've found a suspect who is at hospital.

James tries to talk to Cooper and shows him Laura's cassette. While they were holding that conversation, Truman finds the cocaine in James' bike. James is arrested.

At One-Eyed Jacks, Einar Thorson (Brian Straub) finally agrees to sign the papers to buy the property at Ghostwood.

Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) visits Shelly but it's Leo who ""welcomes"" him trying to kill him with an axe, while there is a shooting episode on the disgusting soap opera Invitation to Love (""Jared"" (Peter Michael Goetz, ""Montana"" (Rick Giolitto) and ""Chet"" (Lance Davis). Bobby is rescued because Hank Jennings shoots Leo.

The timing bomb which Leo had set up to burn Shelly up goes on. Catherine Martell appears and asks Shelly whether she was the person who called her and told her to go there. Pete gets in in order to save Catherine, as they have finally forgotten their arguments.

Leland goes to hospital to smother Jacques off. It looks like Leland has succeeded.

At One-Eyed Jacks, Ben has finally signed his contract. To celebrate, Audrey is dressed as a One Eyed Jack - as a whore. She gets panicky when she sees it's her own father there and approaching....

Cooper goes back to his room and gets called on the phone. A voice tells him not to open the door, but he does so as he believes it's room service. Just then, Andy comes on the phone claiming that someone shot Leo Johnson. When Cooper opens the door, somebody unseen and wearing in black clothing shoots him three times with a silenced gun at close range. A body is heard hitting the floor.

Storm's claustrophobia is finally revealed to the others during a Danger Room exercise when the threat of enclosing walls sends the otherwise composed African mutant into an overwhelming panic, unleashing her raw power and greatly endangering her teammates. The usually gruff and grumpy Wolverine is revealed to indeed have a softer side when he is visited by Jean Grey who asks him to take it easy during his recovery. Wolverine attempts to show no weakness but his injuries are still serious enough to crumple him when exerted. Jean goes to his side and helps him up. They share a tender moment, revealing not only Wolverine's feelings for her but also her brief interest in them as well. This revelation helps to explain a lot about Wolverine's attitude towards Cyclops in general. Jean comes to her senses and breaks away from Logan, awkwardly explaining about being late for a date with Cyclops and leaving Wolverine full of heartache. Later, whilst out on said date, Cyclops and Jean encounter strange mutants in the subway that clash with a group of ordinary but bigoted humans. Forced to step in and help, the couple manage to contain the situation before they are placed under a trance and captured. Upon awakening, Cyclops is introduced to his captor, a mutant named Callisto, ruler of a subterranean tribe of mostly deformed and unsightly mutant outcasts called Morlocks. Callisto wants Cyclops to remain as her lover and provide her with an heir, even threatening to kill Jean Grey should he refuse. Jean manages to alert Xavier telepathically and he sends Storm, Rogue, Gambit and the (mostly) recovered Wolverine to rescue them. They must descend into the tightly spaced tunnels beneath New York which causes Storm some anxiety, though as any good leader, she presses on. The team manage to find Jean but Callisto refuses to part with Cyclops and the two groups clash. The Morlocks are no match for the highly-trained X-Men with Rogue knocking Sunder around the sewer, Jean knocks Masque and Erg down telekinetically, Wolverine briefly tangles with Callisto but she flees, Gambit fends off an attack from Glow Worm and Storm defeats both Tar-Baby and Scaleface. After an encounter with Plague, Gambit and Rogue are forced to retreat back to the mansion in order to save Gambit's life. Wolverine goes after Callisto but discovers an unconscious and captive Cyclops instead. His hesitance to rescue his team leader alerts Callisto and Annalee to his feelings for Jean and they use it against him, with Annalee using her powers to hypnotize Wolverine into attacking Cyclops. Jean subdues him and Analee, giving Callisto a chance to get her hands on Cyclops and she uses this leverage to order her remaining Morlocks to kill the X-Men one at a time until their leader, Storm, agrees to Callisto's terms. Storm counters that by cleverly challenging Callisto to a duel, not only for the lives of the X-Men but for the leadership of the Morlocks as well! Unable to decline lest she lose face, Callisto agrees but forbids Storm from using her powers. Instead they will battle it out both armed with laser staffs. Storm and Callisto clash with Callisto gaining the upper hand, until she accuses Storm of being ""soft"" thanks to her life on the surface world. Storm's younger years had been anything BUT easy and soft and this flagrant judgment infuriates the Wind Rider enough to turn the tables on Callisto, defeating the Morlock Queen in a quick and clean display of fighting prowess. Though Storm is the victor she allows Callisto to live, as killing is not the X-Men's way. As the new leader of the Morlocks, Storm offers them sanctuary at the X-Mansion but they refuse, stating they would only resurface if and when humanity accepts mutantkind. Storm understands and promises to return to them should that happen. In her absence, she places Callisto in charge once more. As the X-Men prepare to leave the sewers Cyclops and Jean shared a romantic kiss, witnessed by a heartbroken Wolverine.

He meets with his guild's leader - Greef Carga, who mostly has low paying bounties which will not cover traveling expenses. Looking to get a big bounty, Carga gives him only an address of his next client who wants the bounty to be private.

The Client, who uses Imperial Stormtroopers as bodyguards, gives the Mandalorian a vague target to bring alive. The only information he is allowed to give is an age (50 years old) and last known location. After receiving Beskar, a special metal given to him by the Client to get an armor upgrade, the Mandalorian meets with the Armorer who melts the metal to give the Mandalorian shoulder armor. The Armorer says the metal was gathered in the The Great Purge and the excess will sponsor other foundlings. The Mandalorian says he was once a foundling.

The Mandalorian travels to the desert planet and meets a native named Kuiil who wants to help him so that he can be rid of the criminals and mercenaries who now inhabit the area. Kuiil teaches the Mandalorian to ride a Blurrg, as there are no land speed vehicles to traverse the area, and sends him to where his bounty is located. Upon reaching the hideout, the Mandalorian is forced to team up with bounty droid IG-11. They manage to clear the entire facility and discover that the bounty is a green, big-eared infant creature, the same species as Yoda. IG-11 plans to kill it, but the Mandalorian blasts the droid to protect the baby and his bounty."

He asks about the plans for the Child, but is given no answer. When the Mandalorian returns to the secret Mandalorian enclave, his damaged armor is replaced by the Armorer with a new set forged from some of the beskar reward. Another Mandalorian berates him for working with former agents of the Galactic Empire, who are responsible for their predicament; the Armorer defuses the situation by reminding them of the Way of Mandalore. Returning to the guild, the Mandalorian learns from Greef Karga that everyone in the guild had a tracking fob for the child. Greef implores him to take some time to rest, but the Mandalorian insists on taking on another job. He asks Greef if he has any idea what The Client has planned for the child, but Greef says he did not ask as it would be against the guild code, telling him he should forget about it. Despite accepting a new assignment and starting to prepare his ship to depart, the Mandalorian has a change of heart at the last moment, unable to bring himself to leave an innocent baby in the hands of dangerous Imperials, and instead turns back to infiltrate The Client's base of operations. Killing many Imperial stormtroopers, he rescues the Child from a laboratory. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by the other bounty hunters and Greef, who demand he hand the Child over. After he refuses, a firefight breaks out, leaving the Mandalorian heavily outnumbered and cornered, but warriors from the Mandalorian enclave unexpectedly arrive, attacking the bounty hunters and giving the Mandalorian cover to escape. Ambushing the Mandalorian on his ship, Greef gives him one last chance to surrender, but the Mandalorian outsmarts him and shoots him, ejecting him from the spacecraft. The Child's hand appears, reaching up to the console from below; the Mandalorian unscrews a control knob that he had earlier berated the Child for playing with, and drops it into its hand."

The Mandalorian soon lands on Sorgan looking to hide from the Guild with the Child. In a local restaurant, they come across a suspicious mercenary who identifies herself as Cara Dune, a former Rebel shocktrooper who had left her position and is hiding on the planet, which she asks the Mandalorian to leave. Back at the Razor Crest, the Mandalorian is approached by two of the villagers hoping to hire him to drive off the raiders. He accepts in return for lodging in the isolated village and uses their payment to hire Dune for extra help. Once at the village, a widowed mother named Omera takes them in and offers them food. Dune and the Mandalorian find a set of tracks in the mud outside the village and identify that the raiders have a powerful Imperial All-Terrain Scout Transport. Dune insists the villagers leave and make their home elsewhere, but they refuse and decide to fight, which the Mandalorian accepts. The Mandalorian and Dune show the farmers how to defend themselves and then set up traps in the krill ponds for the AT-ST. The Mandalorian and Dune infiltrate the raiders' camp to provoke them into attacking. The AT-ST then chases them back to the village but stops short of the krill ponds. The Klatooinian raiders then attack the villagers, while the AT-ST shoots the village with artillery fire. Dune then gets beneath the AT-ST, shooting into one of the viewports. The AT-ST takes the bait and steps into the pond, sinks, and then falls over. The Mandalorian then throws a thermal detonator into the walker, blowing it up, and the raiders flee back into the forest. With peace having returned, the Child plays happily with the other children. The Mandalorian tells Dune and Omera that he plans to leave the Child there as he feels it would be a better life. However, a Kubazi bounty hunter from the Guild takes aim at the Child from the trees. Before he can fire, Dune shoots him from behind. The Mandalorian realizes the Child has to stay under his protection. He bids farewell to Omera and Dune, and leaves the village."

While seeking work to pay for the repairs in a local cantina, he meets Toro Calican, a young bounty hunter looking to join the Bounty Hunter's Guild by capturing Fennec Shand, a well-trained mercenary. Despite having misgivings, the Mandalorian agrees to help him for the bounty, while Calican will take credit for the capture. Peli, meanwhile, has come across the Child and begins to take care of it while working on the ship, growing slightly attached to it. The Mandalorian and Calican travel into the Dune Sea on speeder bikes, looking for Shand. They come upon Tusken Raiders; the Mandalorian barters with them for safe passage. They eventually come across a Dewback with a dead bounty hunter attached to it, which turns out to be bait laid out by Shand to attract anyone looking for her. The two manage to avoid her attacks and capture her but she manages to destroy one of their speeder bikes in the fight. The Mandalorian goes to get the Dewback to replace the destroyed speeder, while Calican watches Shand. She tells him that the Mandalorian is a traitor to the guild and that the bounty on the Mandalorian and the Child are worth a great deal more than her bounty. Calican is unconcerned with the bounty, but Shand points out that taking out a Mandalorian would make him a legend. She offers to help Calican capture the Mandalorian if he sets her free. However, Calican shoots her, assuming that she would betray him, and heads to the repair facility on the speeder bike, where he captures Motto and the Child. The Mandalorian arrives, uses a flash grenade to disorient Calican, and kills him. The Mandalorian then gives Calican's money to Motto to pay for the repairs on his ship and he leaves Tatooine.

The Mandalorian finds a vent into the sewers, where he hopes to find his people's hidden stronghold. Moff Gideon gives them until nightfall to surrender, or he will order his troops to fire. The Mandalorian recognizes Gideon: Gideon had been an officer of the Empire's secret police when the Empire took over Mandalore. IG-11 arrives on a scout trooper's bike with the Child, blasting through the stormtroopers. The Mandalorian takes down several more but is almost killed by Gideon. As they take cover inside, Gideon orders a trooper with a flamethrower to burn them out; the Child uses the Force to reflect the flames back and immolate the trooper. The Mandalorian and IG-11 remain behind while Dune and Karga take the Child into the sewers. IG-11 removes the Mandalorian's helmet to treat his injuries before they join the others in the sewers. Arriving at the Mandalorian enclave, they find it abandoned except for the Armorer, who explains that the Imperials found the enclave when the Mandalorians revealed themselves. Upon seeing the Child who saved the Mandalorian from the Mudhorn on Arvala-7, the Armorer is reminded of the Jedi, who Mandalorians see as their ancient enemies. She instructs the Mandalorian to take the Child to the Jedi, wherever they might be; she also carves a Mudhorn signet into his pauldron and gives him a jetpack. While the Armorer remains behind, the Mandalorian, Dune, Karga, IG-11, and the Child escape down an underground lava river. IG-11 decides to sacrifice himself by walking into an ambush and activating his self-destruct. After they emerge from the tunnel, Gideon attacks in the TIE fighter he arrived in. Using his jetpack the Mandalorian plants explosives on Gideon's fighter, which brings down the craft. With the Imperials seemingly dealt with, Karga invites the Mandalorian to return to the Guild, but he refuses as he must take care of the Child. Dune elects to remain behind to work as Karga's enforcer. The Mandalorian buries Kuiil beneath a cairn of stones and returns to his ship for the journey to come. As the Mandalorian departs Nevarro, Gideon cuts himself out of the crashed fighter with the Darksaber."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0543930/?ref_=ttep_ep10,,The team is searching for a suspected serial killer. The murders started with a young man who was hitchhiking home from the casino after winning $3000. They have little to go on other than a boot print.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Marita Grabiak'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"The episode opens with the Delaware State Police sending a ""teletype"" request for Philly to check all recent cases, open or closed, that involve young male hitchhikers being shot in isolated woods off major roads. The squad members remember such a case which turned out to be that of Matt Mills. He was a very good-looking boy who had won $3000 gambling in Atlantic City, but missed his bus, was seen hitchhiking home, and then found shot execution-style in woods; the body positions and 38 caliber gun matching two other cases in NJ and DE. Other evidence available for the three cases included shoe prints, and a few fibers.

Looking into the records of the victim, he and a friend, Blaine Robbins, had tried to rob a convenience store in Philly a few years before his murder when they were juveniles. They had been caught by the Russian-immigrant owner who was angered that they were released with probation. The robbery plan had been to raise capital for a legitimate vending machine business planned by Blaine. After that, Matt reformed, stayed out of trouble, and got a good entry-level brokerage-firm job.

Looking into Matt's last day in Atlantic City, Blaine said that he met Matt there by accident but couldn't give him a ride home because he had no car.

Other evidence linked the three crimes to a truck driver whose route matched all three locations. Locating a long-time girlfriend who had originally met him while working as a whore at truck stops, she described violent sexually abusive behavior which could just as easily be directed to boys. Fibers from her carpet were consistent with but not unique enough to match the crime scenes. When bought in for questioning, he was arrogant and denied any connection, and agreed to take a lie-detector test, which was useless as he could lie on the control questions without detection. In his arrogance, he had put his feet on their table in front of the officers. Lilly noted that one shoe was worn in a distinctive clutch-pedal pattern, which turned out to match the other two cases but not Matt's. The Delaware police were very thankful for Lilly solving their case.

One of the squad members had formally been at the precinct where the convenience store robbery had occurred. Asking there, he found that the Russian had recently been reported shooting at other robbers. The Russian admitted it, and told from whom he had both got and later returned the gun after using it. But the gun had been sold again and was unavailable. After finding that the Russian's wife had won an Atlantic City excursion, the Russian admitted that he had lied about working at his store the day of the murder, and had in fact seen both boys in Atlantic City but that Blaine had driven off from the hotel before he met up with them. With further extremely intensive questioning by Scotty, the Russian then admitted that yes, he had killed Matt in the manner they said, but please don't hurt his family.

Although Scotty was proud of eliciting a confession, the captain who had been observing wasn't so sure, as it looked like the Russian would have confessed to anything at that point. He held off arresting the Russian and suggested another trip to New Jersey, as further investigation of Blaine's database records had found an employment address at a car-rental company.

The car-rental manager said that shortly after that time, he had turned over a gun, which turned out to be a 38, to his local police after confiscating it from Blaine and firing him for bringing it into work. They then looked at rental records and found that there was one car with unexplained mileage on it that Blaine could have used that day. With more inquiries, they found that Blaine had paid $3000 a few months after Matt's death for flying lessons in a scheme to make money in aerial advertising.

Finally, Blaine confessed, saying that they had been best friends but that Matt had ridiculed and ignored him. In the flashback, they met accidently in the casino, and discussed Blaine's tip from a casino worker about an IPO that needed an investment in a few days; Matt was not enthusiastic, and said he would check with analysts at his firm, and besides, where would they get capital? Then Blaine showed him a gun and told him his plan to rob the casino. Matt treated him like a child, and said he would warn the casino security if he acted like he was going to do anything like that. Later when Matt was hitchhiking, Blaine stops and says he wants to apologize and give him a ride home. After Matt gets in, the next thing we see is Blaine leading Matt at gunpoint into the woods.

In the follow up, Scotty is seen apologizing to the Russian and his family at their store.

As Monty and the other talk Dale looks in to ensure they are not watching him as he moves to secure the giant walnut. Dale, now inside the main room of the tree house attempts to crack the walnut open but fails. Causing Dale to find an even bigger hammer. DTZ emerges, frazzled, and transforms as his body begins to inflate and turn into a chair as Dale returns with a larger hammer. Dale notices a button flashing from the walnut that has now revealed itself to be an alien spaceship. Dale goes and presses the button, releasing strange creatures that frighten him. He lands on DTZ, disguised as a chair, who knocks him off.

DTZ then emerges from his chair form to reveal his true form and attempts to recapture all the Erkburgles that Dale released from DTZ's spaceship. Dale, thrilled to see a real alien, tries to catch DTZ, who transforms by inflating himself again and turning into goo as DTZ tries to escape by going underneath the door through the cracks but is pulled back by Dale. They crash into the TV, dazed. DTZ tries to flee again, but Dale grabs his tail. DTZ yells at Dale to let go of his tail. DTZ transforms into a coiled spring, bouncing up and down with Dale holding on. As DTZ stretches and enlarges his spring form, Dale is pulled closer. A starburst effect signaling DTZ's transformation as DTZ transforms into a dragon. Dale now looking up at DTZ's new form continues to hold on to DTZ's tail as it grows thicker and larger, with spikes emerging and growing to match his new form. Dale's grip adjusts to the changing tail as DTZ completes his transformation.

DTZ, now towering over Dale, takes on the appearance of a dragon with a long, narrow face with a jagged mouth, two small curved horns on top of his head, and two frills resembling ear fins on the sides. He has large yellow eyes with black pupils and red crested spikes that run from the top of his head down his back, all the way to the tip of his tail. His long, flexible neck is covered with tan-colored banded scales that continue down to his plump belly. He has short, stout arms ending in four-fingered hands with claw-like digits, and large, thick thighs that support his feet, each with three sharp-toed claws. DTZ picks up Dale and lifts him up to his face as he begins to roar at Dale, who then excitedly asks if DTZ plans to take over the planet. DTZ, confused, explains he just wants to stay on Earth and have fun. Dale suggests DTZ become a Rescue Ranger. DTZ transforms into a copy of Dale but falls due to the size change.

Chip, hearing the commotion, mistakes DTZ for Dale and scolds him about the walnuts. DTZ, not understanding, irritates Chip further. Dale and DTZ gather walnuts, with DTZ using his powers to make the job more easier as well as make them float back to HQ. The other Rangers, cleaning the kitchen, are surprised by Dale's sudden productivity as Dale enters the rooms complete with a new batch of walnuts for Monty's recipe. Chip wanders about the HQ when he happens to come across Dale washing the Ranger Plane and is confounded by Dale's sudden personality change but quickly becomes confused by seeing Dale in two places, as Dale emerges with Monterrey Jack who tells Chip that everyone is going down to help Gadget move some equipment. Unsure what is happening Chip quickly tries to explain to Monty that he saw Dale cleaning the Ranger Plane but is humorously ignored by both Dale and Monty who think Chip is seeing things. Chip, shrugs it off.

Gadget, Monty, Zipper, Chip and a disguised DTZ all lift a typewriter gadget finds and attempts to carry it into a small elevator shaft. Monty asks Gadget if they can take a small break to which Gadget agrees to but forgets that she was also holding up the typewriter which causes the others to forcibly drop the typewriter on the ground due to the weight of the equipment. As the other Rangers take a quick water break Dale looks over in a hammock as he relaxes and eats grapes while he notices DTZ still near the typewriter. DTZ still disguised as Dale proceeds to use his alien power to make the typewriter lift itself up into the tree house. The other rangers returns from their water break when they notice that typewriter is now missing and ask Dale where the typewriter is. When DTZ answers back that the typewriter is now in the tree house Chip becomes confused and astounded that the disguised DTZ was able to do that all by himself.

Dale and DTZ perform more chores as Dale goes fishing, but DTZ, hearing his name called by Bric and Brac on the TV, panics and hides. The Rangers, unaware, of DTZ's presence stumble into the room. Monterrey tells the other Rescue Rangers that they have more cookies left over but the other rangers are now tired and sick of eating Monty's cookies as they begin to talk about how Dale has changed and how much they enjoy Dale's new personality change and hope that Dale stays like this forever. Dale returns and takes DTZ to his room, where Dale proceeds to list more chores for DTZ to do. DTZ then offers Dale a ride in his spaceship which excites Dale. DTZ then sends Dale to the mothership. Dale, thinking he's just going for a ride, ends up on the mothership. Where Dale encounters Bric and Brac for the first time as both Bric and Brac are unaware that this is not their DTZ.

Dale messes with the ship's controls, causing chaos. Bric and Brac, thinking Dale is DTZ, end up sending him away to his room but instead of Dale returning to DTZ's room he ends up finding more controls to mess with causing even more chaos and havoc for Bric and Brac. They then both try to feed him DTZ's favorite food, but Dale's disgust makes them think DTZ is becoming too much like an earthling. Bric proceeds to capture Dale by freezing him but instead misses and ends up hitting Brac instead as Dale is able to escapes back to Earth, returning to the Rangers' HQ. The Rangers watch a movie, trying to understand Dale's strange behavior. DTZ, trying to fit in, eventually sits with them.

As Dale makes land fall back on earth he rushes back to the HQ in order to warn everyone of the impostor. As the other rangers continue to watch the movie DTZ, disguised as Dale, begins to laugh uncontrollable at a scene in the movie which causes confusion among the other Rescue Rangers who are unsure why the disguised Dale finds the movie funny. Dale returns, and causes DTZ to panic until DTZ comes up with an idea and yells to the others about aliens, which causes a panic. Initially thinking the disguised Dale is making jokes the real Dale bursts in, which causes the other rangers to freak out and panic as both he and DTZ accuse each other of being the alien. As DTZ and Dale fight the other Rescue Rangers attempt to stop their fighting when they realize that there are two Dales.

When suddenly everyone in the HQ hears a loud rumbling sound as Zipper alerts everyone to a ship approaching the HQ. Bric and Brac disembarks from the mothership, demanding DTZ return or they will blow up the entire planet. DTZ leans overs to Dale to tell them that they are bluffing but when Gadget attempt to explain to both Bric and Brac that they will blow up to if they go through with their plan. Both Bric and Brac laugh at this remark as they demonstrate to her by blowing themselves up and reforming and letting everyone know that they are made of unstable molecules which means that they will not be harmed but the destruction of the planet. DTZ blushes knowing that he lied to Dale.

However Dale, remembering what DTZ's weakness is, uses DTZ's favorite food to lure him out. DTZ, revealing himself, is caught by Bric and Brac, who are happy to have him back. The Rangers, relieved to have their Dale back, share a laugh as DTZ happily eats his favorite food."

However, a strange noise soon fills her ears and those of her workers. As Queenie watches, the entire hive of bees leaves and flies off.

Queenie soon after gives chase, but not used to such exertions, faints to the ground. Zipper soon comes across the Queen Bee, and is enchanted by her. When she asks if he can provide her with help, Zipper takes her to the Rescue Rangers.

Going through the city, they soon find the swarm of bees, breaking into a music store and making off with musical instruments, before hijacking a truck and carrying the instruments away.

The group finds the truck and instruments arriving at a pest control building, with the same noise that Queenie had heard before filling the air. The sound is generated by a machine created by Irwina Allen, a worker for the pest control company, who intends to mind-control the bees in a quest to become a rock and roll star.

The rangers attempt to turn off the machine, but Irwina sics the swarm on them and Queenie, who escape through a drain in the building.

As they ponder why Irwina would need musical instruments, Dale notes that the instruments resemble those from the heavy metal band, Iron Goose, who are planning to perform that evening.

The rangers then go to the venue, only to find Irwina having trapped the band in their dressing room. The rangers again attempt to stop Irwina, but she ends up trapping Zipper and Queenie in a saxophone, and putting the rest of the rangers in the drum set.

Irwina then takes to the stage, but her strange song and grating vocal turn-off the audience. However, while some of the bees are performing onstage, some are keeping the audience from leaving.

Zipper and Queenie manage to get free of the saxophone, and as Queenie looks on, Zipper makes a valiant attempt to stop Irwina, but not before she sics her bees on him. Zipper also manages to free the rangers, who manage to turn off Irwina's bee-control device, and put her out of commission. Queenie uses the opportunity to gain control over the swarm, and orders them to attack Irwina.

Once everything is safe, Queenie apologizes to Zipper for how she treated him, given how brave he was to try and help her. However, their moment is interrupted when the rest of the hive takes her away.

Zipper is depressed some time afterward, but soon is smiling when Queenie sends some of her bees to visit with a message from her."

His holographic machine can tells all of the thundercats strengths and weaknesses. He captures wildkit and wildcat first putting them in thundrainium cells. Next he captures cheetara and tygra together, He fires rocket cuffs that is about to hit tygra, cheetara see the rocket cuffs pushing tygra out of the way. Cheetara gets hit attach themselves to her ankles and wrists and is helpless in the air nowhere to go.Tygra tell joe to free her joe tells tygra who you with your bolo-whip. Tygra than is tapped in a hole that fills with watch, tygra can't swin so he's defeated. Next we see cheetara and tygra in they cages weak as kittens, am guessing safari joe put tygra in this cage first than cheetara since she was in rocket cuffs. I never saw tygra look so bad as he did against safari joe, cheetara talks to joe saying why are you doing this and joe tell's she for sprots why else. Cheetara yells back and safari joe and joe tells her to take that back or i'll make your tiger friend into a rug. Tygra is so weak he don't even talk to safari joe. Next its panthro turn He's in the Tank, but Safari Joe manages to capsize it. Joe's next move is to capatalize on Panthro's fear of bats and shoots an energy bat to attack him. For whatever reason, this makes Panthro basically just pass out. Safari joe walks up to panthro kicks him and saids safari joe has done it again.Lion-O is back at the Lair and worried. But never fear, Jaga appears and explains what Safari Joe is up to. Empowered by the knowledge, Lion-O struts out of the Lair...only to fall into a hole. However, he's wise to Safari Joe's plan and manages to leap out without being shot. For whatever reason, Lion-O summons the 'Cats even though he knows they're imprisoned. Maybe he's contractually obligated to send up the signal once an episode, heh heh. When blackmailing Lion-O into surrendering didn't work, he strikes up a ""deal"" to get Lion-O to fight without the Sword. Lion-O agrees and throws the Sword aside, but leads Safari Joe into the Lair for the hunt. Lion-O almost succeeds in sneaking up on Safari Joe when he tumbles down along with a pile of boxes in the storage room. Lion-O is almost captured when Snarf sends a bucket sailing into the side of Joe's bald head. He drops his gun, causing it to shoot all its ammo. The bully was caught! The ThunderCats freed! the end, they let Safari Joe take off in his ship. But, they made him promise not to hunt anymore and changed Mule's work directive to make sure he adheres to the promise.

Things i didnot get how come tygra didnot turn invisble to fight against joe."
