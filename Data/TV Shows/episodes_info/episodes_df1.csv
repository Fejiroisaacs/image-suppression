Welcome to the new Charlie Sheen sitcom, very loosely based on the 2003 Jack Nicholson-Adam Sandler movie of the same name.

We open with Charlie looking directly into the camera saying ""You can't fire me. I quit. You think you can replace me with some other guy? Go ahead it won't be the same. You may think I'm losing but I'm not I'm..."".

Before he can say ""winning,"" the camera pulls back to reveal that Charlie is addressing a punching bag dummy named Bobo. He turns to a group of people sitting on couches and chairs in a posh living room and says that Bobo is there to help them work out their anger. For you see Charlie Goodson is an anger management therapist.

We learn that he used to be a minor league ballplayer. When he finally got called up to the majors, he was so angry when a fan caught a foul ball that would've been an out if Charlie had caught it, he got so angry that he tried to break a bat over his knee. He injured himself and destroyed his career. He then went back to school to become a therapist to help others deal with their anger issues.

He shows this video to his therapy group, most of whom mock him for it. They are a curmudgeonly old homophobe named Ed, a ,middle-aged gay man named Patrick, a bimbo named Lacey-- who shot her boyfriend in the ballls after she caught him cheating-- and a young doofus named Nolan.

In addition to the group that meets in his home, Charlie also does pro bono work at the state prison and has a group of hardened convicts he works with there.

He is also dealing with the new boyfriend of his ex-wife Jen, with whom he generally has a good relationship. He and the boyfriend tangle over the way he talks to Charlie's daughter Sam. (Sam is a teenager and has OCD.) The argument gets so heated that at one point Charlie picks up a lamp to threaten the boyfriend and realizes that his anger issues remain.

Charlie is also friends with the bartender at his local watering hole, played by Brett Butler.

Charlie also has a horny neighbor named Michael, in whom he confides that he thinks he needs to go back to therapy himself. But then he admits that the best therapist he knows is also a woman he is sleeping with, his best friend Kate. We see the two having sex and saying things to each other like ""I promise I will never love you.""

When he goes to Kate hoping to get therapy but still have sex she rightly points out that it's an either/or proposition. After one session, however, they decide that the no sex between patients and therapists rule was put in place to protect patients who weren't therapists and consider trying to make it work by having him serve as her therapist as well so they're on a level playing field.

Affter working on his problems Charlie goes to Jen's house and apologizes to her boyfriend. It turns out, however, that he and Jen just broke up and he leaves. Charlie turns to Jen wondering why she let him apologize so sincerely. She says she knows it was hard for him so she enjoyed.

The night began with back to back episodes so on to...

""Anger Management"" - ""Charlie and The Slumpbuster"" - June 28, 2012

We open with Charlie on a date with a bimbo named Daytona who orders her drink by color. Charlie's bartender friend Brett wants to know if she wants it in a sippy cup.

Jen and Sam show up and recognize that Charlie is once again dating an idiot.

He later tries to explain to them that he dates hot, dumb women because he's a ""tool of evolution, this is how our species gets hotter.""

A new girl named Mel joins his home therapy group. She is mousy and gangly. She starts to tell her tale: she is from a small town in Wisconsin and once met a guy who changed her life and gave her hope. She used to be fat and unnattactive and one day this attractive ballplayer came into the diner where she worked and picked her to sleep with. But then she heard from a friend about ""slumpbusters."" This is apparently a tradition in which a ballplayer will find the ugliest woman he can to sleep with in order to break a hitting slump. That guy, of course, was Charlie. Everyone in her hometown started mocking her and she got very angry. Patrick says what everyone is thinking, ""who didn't see that coming?"" Charlie didn't recognize her because she lost 100 pounds and got plastic surgery.

Since Charlie has ""evolved"" he feels terrible that he did this to Mel and wants to make it up to her, even though she's clearly an unstable stalker. So he offers to make dinner for her and calls it a date.

Jen and Sam happen to come over during his apology ""date"" and are impressed that Charlie would date a woman so average. He realizes that this raises his esteem in Sam's eyes so he keeps up the charade even though Jen sees right through it.

The next day he explains to the group what he tried to do, realizes it backfires and sums it up by saying ""never use a slumpbuster"" and understands that this does not apply to everyone.

Then Charlie and Mel go over to Jen and Sam's and do some crafting with them. Charlie keeps up the charade that he and Mel are dating. Later that night at his house, Mel feigns an allergic reaction and runs off to the kitchen and tells Charlie to come in. When he does she's naked on the counter. He turns her down and she's sad that even though she's changed her outward appearance he still doesn't want her. He finally admits that she was his slumpbuster and she gets angry and he explains that he's sorry and he pretended they were dating to spare her feelings and tries to build up her confidence back to the place where she felt that the hot ballplayer simply wanted her for who she was.

He makes a deal with her to try to make her feel better: he will go with her to her hometown and walk around with her holding her hand so people will see she was not a slumpbuster.

When he tells Jen, she thinks this is admirable and covers for him in front of Sam, even though she points out that this is the first time she's met one of the women that he cheated on her with. He says he did it for the family since he was trying to break out of his slump and be a successful player. He admits that Diane in San Diego was just for him though."

Jen and Sam return from a trip to visit Charlie's parents. Sam is zonked out but Jen couldn't sleep for the entire journey and is crazy with the sleep deprivation. Charlie puts her to bed in his bed and she starts confessing things: his mother's bitch, she slept naked for weeks to try and trick him into getting her pregnant to save their marriage. He gets the idea that sleep deprivation is like truth serum and decides to try it out on his therapy group.

He tells the group about it and Ed reminisces, apparently humorously, about being kept awake by toture in Vietnam.

When he's setting up the cameras to record the session he talks with Sam about her trip. She complains that the TSA made her pull out all of her lucky charms during the security check and the list is long and she thinks she's a freak. Charlie tries to make her feel better by showing her the penny that his dad got him as a kid when they went to Carlsbard Caverns. The best trip they ever took. Kate arrives and Sam leaves. Kate wonders why Sam doesn't like her and wonders if she knows they're sleeping together. Charlie says no one knows. He has asked her over to ask if she will come over and spell him so he can get some rest during the sleep deprivation study so he can be fresh when it's time for the session.She thinks it's a bad idea and thinks he's only doing it to get professional recognition in psychology journals. She says this is how he's transferred his need for attention since leaving baseball. He cops to it but says it could still be good methodology and she agrees to help. Jen enters and Charlie leaves. Jen tells Kate that she always thought that Kate and Charlie had the hots for each other but says she now realizes this was crazy because Kate is gay. Kate doesn't say she's gay but says she lives in the moment. Jen says they should hang out.

Patrick arrives first to lay claim on the couch for the 'no-sleepover.' Ed arrives next and tricks Patrick off the couch. Lacey and Nolan arrive together and we learn he's essentially been stalking her. Charlie tells everyone they simply have to stay up and once they are all sufficiently tired and vulnerable they can start the session.

Patrick, the actor, keeps trying to fake his breakthroughs into one of the cameras. Ed is playing video games. Nolan invites Lacey to dinner in the kitchen and is cute and funny and she says that. They are starting to get punchy. Charlie enters and Lacey puts the moves on him. He calls her out on transference saying that, as the only man to listen and pay attention to her, she thinks she loves him. She says she just wants sex. As everyone, including Charlie, is breaking down Kate arrives and says she can't watch the group while Charlie rests because one of her patients is being committed and it's an emergency. Charlie calls the group to order. Lacey realizes she's substituting sex for love, Nolan realizes Lacey is a ""slut,"" Patrick realizes he has no genuine emotions, and Charlie accidentally calls Ed ""dad.""

Later in the kitchen, Kate helps him get to the bottom of the whole experiment: it was Charlie who was seeking a breakthrough. By seeking the approval of the journals it was like seeking the approval of the father who never gave it to him. Kate partially helps him make this breakthrough by repeatedly slapping him in the face.

After they get some sleep, Charlie apologizes to Ed and accidentally gives his Carlsbad Cavern penny to Lacey who admits she also has daddy abandonment issues also. He tells Kate he's sad that he gave her the penny. She asks if he wants her to take him to Carlbad Caverns. Once he determines that this is a euphemism he agrees."

We open in Charlie's groups. Ed is complaining about his wife getting a DVR and skipping over the commercials which he likes. Patrick is annoyed at the triviality of the problem. Nolan eggs him on to get angry about it. Lacey says he's really angry about ""the brown people,"" like he always is. Ed says it's not that it's that he's cried twice in the last 20 years it's been over commercials. Charlie calls it a day before Patrick can share and he gets angry.

Sam arrives with Jennifer. Jennifer notes that the people in his group look just like regular people. She hits up Charlie for his half of her SAT prep books. She's only in middle school but is worried about college. Charlie tells her to get in a club for an extra-curricular activity. She's still nervous but he tells her not to be, but admits that's just a load of crap his dad laid on him.

Sam heads upstairs and Charlie finds Jennifer's erotica. She calls it a ""historical novel"" and describes ""Gone With the Wind."" He calls it a ""spank book."" She denies this. He reads from it and proves her point. He wants her to read something worthwhile. She says it's just harmless fun like all the women he slept with when they were married.

In therapy with Kate, Charlie grouses about Jen's romance novel. Kate thinks the book makes him nervous because it holds men to an unrealstic standard. Kate is nervous about the outfit she's wearing to a televised trial in which she's appearing as an expert witness so she begins to take off her clothes .Charlie misinterprets this as an invitation to sex. She disabuses him of this notion and says they shouldn't have sex during session. Charlie gives Kate Patrick's number since he's a personal shopper.

In her new afterschool club, Sam and her friends obsess about college. Sam and her friends talk about sex and she claims she ""made love"" to a stable boy at her Aunt Sabrina's farm.She's quoting directly from Jen's romance novel.

Patrick is late for Charlie's group. He texts the group to say he's quitting the group. Charlie says he's disappointed but not surprised.

Charlie meets with his pro bono prison group. None of them were able to keep their kittens alive over the weekend. One convict shares a ""success story"" about how he went through the steps to control his anger when he thought the Lil Debbie snacks he was going to have as anniversary treat with another convict were stolen. They were actually ...in his ass the whole time.

Charlie admits he lost something also and he's having some emotions about it. He explains about Patrick leaving and his feeling disrespected. Another convict shares his story about a woman leaving him and it turned out that she was stolen by his friend. He killed them both. Another convict counsels going to his work to track him down since ""the ho left you.""

Charlie goes to Parick's work. Patrick calls it wildly inappropriate. He says his new therapist that it's best for him to make a clean break. It turns out that Kate has poached him. Charlie says Patrick was just supposed to dress her. Patrick says he did, which was a miracle since she has boy hips and monkey arms. Charlie says he's making a mistake and needs to continue with him but that Kate is a great therapist.

He meets Kate for dinner and calls her out. She says it was totally Patrick's decision and that people change therapists all the time. He says her therapy-style is going to make him backslide since she's rewarding Patrick's passive-aggressive behavior. She gives Charlie permission to physicalize his anger. He tries to dump ketchup on her but it doesn't come out. He then tells her this means war.(He then apologizes to some nearby soldiers.)

Jen drops by Charlie's to tell him about the problem with Sam talking about sex with her college prep club meeting. Sam comes down and explains she made up that story to put off the girls who said she was never going to have sex because of her OCD. Jen blames Charlie for having filth around but Sam says it was Jen's books she was quoting from. Sam apologizes. Charlie says he understands since she felt peer pressure. Charlie and Jen talk about the book and she admits it is a turn on, it's about making someone feel wanted, passion. Charlie translates this to Patrick and goes to him and dramatically declares that he needs Patrick back in the group. Patrick falls for it but is mad Charlie doesn't ""carry him off."" Charlie points out he has a bad back."

Tonight's special guest star is none other than ex-Mrs. Charlie Sheen herself, Denise Richard. The two actually have nice chemistry.

The episode opens in group where they are tackling Patrick's anger problems with his boyfriend Scott, whose clothes he has set on fire. (Ed wants to know if this why gays are called ""flamers"" and claims he's just trying to learn.) Nolan is sad he can't quip. Patrick also thinks his mother Mona's ghost is haunting his apartment.

Jennifer has her friend Laurie coming over to Charlie's to pitch his investment in a small business: Vanicurist- a manicurist on wheels. Charlie thinks it's a terrible idea until he opens the door and sees Laurie, who is beautiful (Richards.) He says he supports Jen totally. Laurie says her ex can be a little difficult, nuts, a maniac, a wackjob. Charlie says he gets it.

Later at Jen's house, Charlie asks Jen for Laurie's number. Jen says no and says he wouldn't like her since he only dates young airheads. He says he's trying to change and find someone more substantial. Jen finally relents.

Charlie and Laurie go on a date and it goes very well, they're both surprised with how much they like each other. She turns him down for going back to his place on his first date. She says being a therapist must be fun and basically puts it down and compares it to her uncle being a magician.

Jen comes over to pick up Sam and gives him Laurie's report card that she had a great time and thought he was funny. Jen wonders what she put in her drink. She also confirms that Laurie doesn't ""believe"" in therapy.

Later Charlie and Laurie have a Skype date while she's in Chicago. She confirms on their next date they will be bumping uglies. Charlie says he knows she doesn't believe in therapy but thinks her healthy sexuality is the result of a good, close-knit family. She blows off his analysis and says she just wants to have sex.

Kate comes over at the end of the date and he turns down sex with her since the rules of their relationship which state that if one of them is close to a real relationship they have to suspend sex. She says she'll see him Thursday. He says he thinks this one might work and he's going to prove to her that therapy is real and then they will have a great relationship. Kate is highly skeptical.

Charlie has Laurie sit in on a group therapy meeting with him and he brings in a guest, a former patient he ""cured."" It backfires on him when after a nice calm chat the guy goes off the deep end and rants about his girlfriend cheating on him and he attacks Bobo at Charlie's behest. She leaves, mocking Charlie on the way out.

We cut to Charlie getting in bed with Kate...on Friday. She tells him a story her mom used to tell about how a fish and a duck couldnt fall in love because they were too differen.... and their sexual organs wouldn't line up. Charlie starts wondering if therapy is just smoke and mirrors and doubting himself. As they're about to get it on, Patrick calls with an emergency.

Charlie heads over and Patrick is in meltdown mode that his mother is haunting him and is very angry because she keeps rattling a fringed lamp. After Charlie talks him through his crisis-- which basically boils down to how cold and cruel his mother was, which Charlie thinks he should bring up in therapy-- he notices that the fringe on the lamp quivers because the AC just kicked on. Patrick realizes his error and is embarrassed but grateful. He reassures Charlie that he is a good therapist.

Charlie meets Laurie out for a drink and says he doesn't care if she's a fish and he's a duck they can make their genitals line up. Laurie agrees she can get past not believing in what he does for a living because she likes him too. But when he learns that she also believes in astrology,ghosts, and that Paula Abdul should be called ""the great Paula Abdul"" but not therapy or birth control, he ditches her and heads to Kate's. He declares he ""made it to Saturday."""

In group Charlie commends the members for all going 30 days without having an anger outburst. He promises that at the next session they will celebrate if everyone is still going strong.

Later, Charlie and Kate lie on the floor post-coital, panting and happy. Kate is about to leave when Charlie asks if she wants to go to a movie. She declines somewhat awkwardly and he feels weird.

Later Kate is leaving, Charlie is in his bathrobe and Jen shows up wondering what she's doing ther. Charle claims his back went out and Kate came over since she's also a massage therapist as well as a regular therapy. Jen is nervous and glad Kate is there-- especially since she thinks Kate is a lesbian. She shows Charlie and Kate a picture on Sam's Facebook page of Sam kissing a girl. Charlie says they should wait to talk to Sam.

At the bar Brett tells Charlie that they're very similar since they both help people through their problems. Then she hits on him and he rebuffs her. Kate shows up with a ""date"" for Charlie's movie. She has procured stuffy, older film professor Judy to accompany him.Charlie is confused since he thought he was going to the movies with Kate. She's full of movie trivia. Charlie wonders what is up. Kate explains that since Charlie asked her to a movie after sex she's worried he's becoming romantically attached and she can't have that so she's giving him Judy so they won't ruin their friendship. She says if she sees another sign of emotional involvement that it's over. He goes to talk to Judy who turns out was a patient of Kate's: OCD.

Jen and Charlie approach Sam about the girl-kissing picture. She says she was trying to get a boy to like her and he didn't even notice. They tell her not to do that.

We cut to Charlie's living room destroyed. He is lecturing the group that they all have to write papers on ""what happened"" and he'd like them by Monday when their 30 day ""no anger"" calendar starts again. They all bicker about the melee except the doofus who calls it the best party ever.

Charlie's neighbor Michael comes over and asks him to a movie. Charlie says he can't since then it will be clear that he has feelings for him. He explains about Kate's concerns that Charlie has feelings for her. Michael says he does, and that the whole FWB thing is about denial. Charlie realizes he's right.

Charlie goes over to Jen's and she confesses that she thinks Sam got the ""gay gene"" from her because she had a few same sex experiences. Charlie reassures Jen she's not gay. She says he's just saying that because it makes him feel like he couldn't please her. He says he always did. She says George Clooney helped. She reminisces that it was nice to kiss a girl. Charlie posits that kissing is more intimate then sex which is where the feelings come from and you see the wheels turning. Jen agrees and says that's probably why hookers don't kiss.

Later Charlie and Kate are in bed and he tries to avoid kissing her. And he explains his theory about kissing. She says she doesn't care if he kisses her. He says okay and she agrees. He heads under the covers. And then she says it's weird and it feels like they've jumped to the middle, she says she needs a beginning. They try again and it doesn't work and she feels bad. She realizes she needs the kissing to get aroused and she's tangled up romance and sex. She wonders if he does. She feels between his legs. He doesn't. She gets mad and telsl him to leave.

At his prison group a convict is complaining his pen pal wants a commitment. He doesn't want to be tied down. Charlie points out that he's in prison. The convict wonders why women want commitment. Charlie says some women don't, they just want sex. Another convict tells Charlie that he thinks that he needs to tell this sex only woman how he feels. Sometimes, he says, people need to feel safe before they can open up.

Later Charlie goes to his therapy appointment with Kate. He says he wants to talk about his problems with his best friend. She says they have two choices essentially, they can talk about what they might be feeling for each other and fall in love and have it go south and ruin their friendship or they can just agree on a deal where she goes to the movies with him and he kisses her. He agrees. They kiss. She declares she's ""ready."""

As VE Day comes and goes, Claire Randall--an army combat nurse--is reunited with her husband Frank. After five years of near-constant separation, the two take a second honeymoon to Scotland in order to rediscover each other. The holiday shows signs of success, until Claire is inexplicably thrown back in time by way of a standing stone circle at Craig na Dun.

Claire finds herself immediately pulled into the whirlwind of violence and desperation that is 1740's Scottish Highlands. Within minutes is nearly raped, only to be rescued then kidnapped by a group of Highland outlaws, who take her to the seat of the Clan MacKenzie--Castle Leoch.

It is on this journey that she meets Jamie Fraser, a young Highlander whose injuries require Claire's skilled attention. Her language and twentieth century mannerisms, however, gain everyone's attention.

More detail:

Prologue: The episode opens on a brooding Scottish highlands scene, with storm clouds in the distance. Claire Randall (Catriona Balfe), as a voice-over, muses ""People disappear all the time. Young girls run away from home, children stray from their parents and are never seen again. Housewives take the grocery money and a taxi to the train station. Most are found, eventually. Diappearances, after all, have explanations -- usually."" As Claire strolls down the street in post-World War II Inverness, she stops to gaze in the window of Farrells General Store. Spotting a display of vases, the voice-over continues, realizing that she has never lived in a place long enough to need a vase, and her yearning for that kind of stability. ""It was a Tuesday afternoon, six months after the end of the war . . .""

Flashback to Claire as a World War II battle nurse, struggling to stop the bleeding of a wounded soldier (Jack Eyers) in a makeshift medical ward in a bombed-out alley. A doctor (David Elliot) dashes over and takes over, and she stumbles out of the ward, exhausted. She becomes aware of car horns and a gathering of excited soldiers, laughing, crying and hugging each other. Another nurse (Clare Yuille) dashes up, excitedly presses an opened bottle of champagne into Claire's hands, and tells Claire that the war is over. Claire watches the growing celebration silently, and takes a swig of the champagne.

In Inverness, six months later, as she walks away from the store down the cold grey street, Claire declares that even knowing what she knows now, she would have made the same choices.

* Credits *

Claire and her husband, Frank Randall (Tobias Menzies) are riding in a convertible along a deserted Scottish road, the wind in their hair, the sun shining, enjoying a second honeymoon six months after the war. The radio is playing bright 1940's music, and the voice-over continues to narrate that she and Frank chose to take a trip to the Scottish highlands to reconnect after being apart for five years. Parking the car on the street, Frank notices a red smear across an otherwise pristine door, and brings it to Claire's attention. She is startled to see blood, and when Frank is doubtful that it might be blood, she reminds him that, after being a nurse, she knows what blood looks like. They notice that several doors on the street have the same blood streaks, and Claire wonders if the houses are marked for a mystical reason. Frank reminds her that there is no where else on earth where paganism and mysticism are such a part of everyday life as the Scottish highlands. They enter their bed and breakfast, and the propriotress, Mrs. Baird (Kathryn Howden), explains that the blood comes from a black cockerel, and that it is the custom at that time of year to make a sacrifice to honor St. Odhran [whose feast day is October 27th]. Frank recognizes the name, to Mrs. Baird's surprise, and Claire explains that Frank is a historian, who will be taking up a teaching post at Oxford in two weeks. Frank goes on to explain that Odhran was buried alive voluntarily, and Claire grimaces. Mrs. Baird tells them it's a good time for a holiday, since it is close to Samhain, which Claire recognizes as Gaelic for Halloween. Frank explains that the church borrowed several of the pagan holidays. Mrs. Baird warns them that the holidays brings out ghosts, who wander about doing ""good or ill as they please,"" to Claire's amusement.

As they check into their room, Claire thinks about how much trouble they have had getting to know each other again after the war. He takes an experimental bounce on the squeaky bed, and wryly observes that there will be no ""marital privacy,"" and that Mrs. Baird will probably be able to hear ""any renewed attempts to start a family."" Claire smiles, and Frank reaches for a book. Claire teases him about not ""adding another branch to his family tree unless he shows more industry"", and begins to bounce on the bed, making it squeak suggestively. Frank joins her as they playfully bounce, making Mrs. Baird downstairs look up at a slightly swinging chandalier speculatively. The teasing play becomes tender as they tell each other what they remembered of the other during stressful times in the war -- Claire remembers the sound of Frank's laugh, and Frank remembers that he would sketch Claire's hand because he remembered it so clearly. They kiss, and gradually they undress -- and the bed begins to squeak again, more softly. Mrs. Baird, downstairs, smiles to herself.

The next day, during a drive, Frank points to an unusual rock formation on a nearby hill, and tells Claire that it is Cocknamon Rock, a place that the British used to use for ambushes in the 17th and 18th centuries. Claire glances at it with passing interest, smiling at Frank's absorption in history. She reflects that she is used to history, being raised by her archeologist uncle after the death of her parents, with a flashback to a young Claire (Elizabeth Bowie) at her Uncle Lamb's (Prentis Hancock) dig, lighting an unladylike cigarette for her uncle and admiring his work. As they stroll around the grounds of a castle ruin, Claire explains that Frank has become interested in his personal genealogy, and she has become interested in botany and medicinal plants. She examines plants while Frank takes a photo of Castle Leoch, the ancestral home of Clan MacKenzie, and realizes that Frank is pursuing his interest in the past to help him forget his job as an intelligence officer during the war. Frank comments that a distant ancestor of his, a British officer, worked in that area and may have actually visited the castle at some point. They continue to explore the castle, delving deeper into dusty, overgrown rooms. Claire sits provocatively on a table and gives Frank a ""look."" Frank observes mildly that it's a bit dirty, and Claire, raising her skirt invitingly, tells him that he can give her a bath. He comes over to her, and as his hand traces the line of her thigh upwards, he discovers that ""why, Mrs. Randall, I do believe you've left your undergarments at home,"" and proceeds to take advantage of the opportunity.

That afternoon, while Claire is browsing through a book by the fire, Reverend Wakefield (James Fleet) and Frank are excited they have found evidence of his distant relative, British Captain Jonathan Wolverton Randall of the Dragoons, otherwise known as ""Black Jack."" The Reverend points out that Captain Randall spent a lot of time harassing the Scottish countryside. Claire comments that the Scottish still seem suspicious of the English, and remembers that the evening before, at a pub, being called ""sassenach."" Reverend Wakefield explains that she shouldn't be offended, it's simply their word for an Englishman, ""or, at worst, an outlander."" The housekeeper, Mrs. Graham (Tracey Wilkinson), brings tea, and invites Claire into the kitchen to join her. Claire drinks her oolong tea appreciatively, and Mrs. Graham tells her that she can read tea leaves. As Claire finishes her tea, Mrs.Graham begins to read the leaves, but is confused -- signs of a journey, but also staying in one place and several strangers. She takes Claire's hand to read her palm, and tells Claire that she has an unusual pattern, and has a pronounced Mount of Venus, which, ""to be polite about it, means that your husband won't stray far from your bed,"" she says, laughing. But her life line is interrupted, divided, not broken. Claire is skeptical, but thoughtful. The Rev. and Frank join them in the kitchen, speculating on whether Black Jack Randall had a secret patron that kept him out of trouble -- the Duke of Sandringham, a suspected Jacobite. As they warm to their topic and jiggle the team tray, Mrs. Graham scolds them and rescues the tray, and Claire take the opportunity to return to the bed and breakfast. As she walks back, she passes the store to gaze at the vases, and then hurries on, reflecting that what she didn't know that ""tomorrow would prove less important than yesterday. Later, in front of a mirror, she attempts to brush out her wayward hair, muttering ""Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!"" impatiently at the tangles. As Frank is walking up to the building that night, in the wind and rain, he catches a glimpse of her in the window, at the mirror, and smiles. The smile disappears as he notices a figure in a kilt by the lamppost, head tilted up to also gaze at Claire. Frowning, he approaches the figure from behind and asks if he can help him. The figure turns away quickly, and suddenly Frank is alone, looking around, wondering what just happened.

As he hurries into the room, Claire is startled, commenting that he looks like he's seen a ghost. ""You know, I'm not so sure I haven't,"" he says, staring out the window. Later, in front of the fire, Frank tells Claire about the figure disappearing, almost as if it were a ghost. Claire scoffs, but then Frank leads the conversation into patients that she had during the war, and wonders of any of them might have been Scottish, and might want to . . . reconnect. Claire realizes that Frank is delicately inquiring if she has been unfaithful, and is offended. Frank hastily assures her that if she had, it wouldn't matter, it's not unusual to want a little comfort, because he loves her, and nothing she could ever do could stop his love. She denies it angrily. He begs her to forgive him, and as their kiss deepens and they make love, Claire's voice-over reflects that they often used sex as a bridge to find their way back to each other, despite the obstacles they may encounter during the day. As they lay together in bed afterwards, Frank remembers that he wants to set the alarm. Claire lazily protests and reminds him that they had decided ""no alarms"", but Frank tells her that he wants to see the witches. At Claire's surprise, he explains that there is a group of Druids that observes ancient rituals at a group of standing stones called Craigh na Dun just outside the village, and he wants to go watch them secretly.

Later, before dawn, Frank and Claire make their way up the hillside as Frank explains that the local legends have the stones being brought from Africa by a race of Celtic giants. ""I wasn't aware that the Celts made a lot of trips to Africa,"" Claire responds, amused. They hide in the tall grass as they hear someone coming. A group of women, holding lanterns and wearing white robes, approach the stones, swaying gracefully and begin to dance. Claire recognizes Mrs. Graham as one of the dancers, and experiences a feeling of being an intruder, watching something that she shouldn't be seeing. As the run rises, the dancing changes imperceptibly, and ends with lanterns raised towards a large center stone. The lanterns are extinguished and the spell is broken. Chatting brightly, the dancers leave, leaving the mist swirling in the dawn. Frank and Claire examine the standing stones, but hurry to hide as one of the dancers return, searching the ground and finding a hair ribbon. As the dancer sits down to rest, Frank and Claire quietly leave.

In the afternoon, Frank is preparing for another meeting with the Reverend, and Claire is considering returning to the standing stones to retrieve a flower she can't identify from her botany books. They kiss goodbye, with plans to meet later for dinner. Back at the stones, Claire wraps a shawl around her simple white dress as she parks the car and makes her way back up the hill. She returns to the flower, and reaches to pick one -- and becomes aware of a noise like a rumbling, or distant voices. The sounds seem to come the large center stone and, cautious but curious, she approaches it, laying her hands on the surface of the stone. She describes a sensation similar to an evening car accident she had been in, a sensation of free-falling in the dark at high speed. Regaining consciousness, she finds herself lying on the ground in front of the stone. She scrambles up and hurries away towards the car -- but the road is no longer there, much less a car. Confused, she begins to walk, aware of indefinable changes in the landscape.

Suddenly, she hears a gunshot. A few dozen yards away, she sees soldiers in red coats firing and running. Startled, she thinks that she has stumbled on the set of a historical drama, and watches in fascination as another group of men in kilts come dashing past. She is more deeply confused when she realizes that the ""actors"" are using live ammunition. She trips and falls in her hurry to get away from the group, and as she watches incredulously, one of the soldiers points his gun in her directions and shoots. She flings herself to the ground, gasping, and tries to evade them, and suddenly comes upon a British officer by a stream. She slides to a halt, staring at the officer -- he could be Frank's twin. ""Frank? What the devil are you doing?"" she says, incredulously. The man straightens, regarding her speculatively. ""You're not Frank,"" she whispers, backing away. He introduces himself as Jonathan Randall, Esquire, captain of His Majesty's Eighth Dragoons (Tobias Menzies), ""at your service,"" as he examines her in surprise. She turns away from him and begins to run, but he easily captures her with a well-placed sword block. She declares that her husband is waiting for her, and when he asks her husband's name, she tells him that it is ""Frank Beauchamp, he's a teacher,"" but Captain Randall is skeptical and threatens her to tell him who she really is. She spits in his face and tells him in no uncertain terms to ""take you hands off me, you bastard."" ""Ah, the speech of a lady, the language of a whore. I choose the whore,"" he declares as he brutally shoves her up against the the small cliff and prepares to rape her. Suddenly, Randall falls away, and Claire, spinning around, sees a man in a kilt with a hat pulled low striking Captain Randall unconscious. The man says something to her urgently in Gaelic, his hand outstretched, but she doesn't understand. He gestures again, insistently, and she goes with him reluctantly, exclaiming ""Who are you? Where are we going?"" The Scotsman tries to hush her when he spots more British soldiers, but Claire begins to cry out in fear. Exasperated, the Scotsman takes his knife and strikes her at the base of her head with the handle, knocking her unconscious to quiet her.

She regains consciousness as her erstwhile rescuer is riding towards a small thatched cottage, thinking that it may have been a dream, but realizing from the stench of man and horse that it is no dream. He leads her into the dimly lit cottage, where they join a group of Scotsmen. Startled, they ask her rescuer questions in Gaelic, but she recognizes a few words -- ""sassenach"", ""Craigh na Dun."" A man sitting near the fire stands up and walks up to Claire as the others draw back -- this is obviously the leader. He brings her closer to the fire to observe her, and in a bit of bravado, Claire lifts her chin and snaps, ""I trust you can see me now?"" She continues to use the name Claire Beauchamp, afraid that the men will try to ransom her and not wanting to lead them to Frank and possibly hurting him, too. He questions her rescuer, who tells the story of Claire ""having words with a certain Captain of Dragoons of our acquaintance. There seemed to be some question whether the lady was or was not a whore."" ""And what was the lady's position in this discussion?"" the leader inquires. Claire looks him in the eye and declares ""I am not."" The men smile and one jokes that they should put her to the test, but the leader stills their laughter with a stern, ""I don't hold with rape . . . and we don't have time for it, anyway."" Claire isn't sure what to make of this reprieve, but realizes that she is now their prisoner. Her rescuer tells the leader, Dougal (Graham McTavish), that he doesn't think she's a whore, but Dougal dismisses the question abruptly as she wonders how to escape and return to Inverness. They are in a hurry to leave, but one of them is injured. A young man, Jamie (Sam Heughan), is seated huddled by the fire in obvious pain, his shoulder dislocated. Dougal asks Jamie if he can ride with his shoulder injured, but Jamie doesn't think he can manage a horse. One of the men declares that he will have to force the joint back, and they prepare to work on Jamie's arm. One grabs his arm clumsily and Claire, her nurse's training coming to the fore as she sees what they intend to do, suddenly says sharply, ""Don't you dare!"" She rushes over and several of them pull their knives out on her. Ignoring them, she goes on to explain that they are going about it the wrong way, and what they will do will break his arm. Dougal steps aside in silent invitation for her take a turn. The men watch, wincing, as she grasps his arm. He gasps, and she reassures him that ""this is the worst part,"" then gives the arm a deft twist as it snaps back into place with an audible pop. Jamie takes a deep, surprised breath and declares that it no longer hurts, but Claire isn't finished. Turning to one of the men, she demands something to make a sling, either belt or some cloth. The man looks at her in surprise, but Dougal gruffly tells him to comply, and the man reluctantly hands her his belt. As she quickly makes a sling, Jamie observes that she's done this before, and she tells him that she's a nurse. His eyes quickly flit to her chest. ""Not a wet nurse,"" she snaps, as she gives him instructions to care for it. Jamie thanks her and they prepare to leave. As they walk outside, Claire looks out across the valley expecting to see the lights of the town and, puzzled, and asks where Inverness is in the darkness. Jamie looks at her in surprise, points into the darkness and says, ""You're looking right at it."" Claire is starting to understand what has happened to her - there are no electric lights as far as the eye could see.

Dougal lifts her up to ride with Jamie, with threats against trying to escape. It's raining again, and Claire is shivering in her thin dress. Jamie drapes his plaid around them both, ""because you're shaking so hard it's making my teeth rattle,"" he teases her. Jamie mentions that they will probably be riding all night, and the next one, too, as Claire looks around in dismay. The group moves off, making its way through the forest. The next day, they are riding past a familiar looking rock formation -- Cocknamon Rock. She tells Jamie that the British uses it for ambushes and Jamie, looking around, agrees that it's a good place for an ambush, and rides ahead to warn Dougal. Dougal is suspicious and wants to know how she knows about an ambush, and she tells him that she heard it in the village. Suddenly, Dougal becomes aware of a movement in the brush, and snaps out a order -- Jamie promptly pushes Claire off the horse into the bushes with a battle cry, ""Tulach ard!"" and the group gallops away, pursued by ambushers. She tries to flee, but is quickly intercepted by a bloodied Jamie, who is intent on bringing her back with him. He tells her that if she won't walk, he'll toss her over his shoulder and carry her. Unwilling to injure his shoulder further, she gives up and goes with him. She scolds him for using his shoulder, and he tells her that if he hadn't moved his shoulder, ""I wouldn't be moving anything else ever again."" He boasts a bit about being able to handle a couple of Redcoats, ""but not three,"" and then adds cheerfully that if it's hurt again, she can fix it later. ""That's what you think,"" she tells him. As they join the others, they racously thank her for tipping them off ""and giving us a wee bit of fun!"" They offer her a sip of their whiskey, and she reluctantly takes it, after Jamie whispers that it will warm her up.

Later, as the horses pick their way through the moonlit night, Claire becomes aware that Jamie is sagging in the saddle. Just as he begins to fall, she cries out, ""Stop! Help, he's going over!"" The group halts, and she quickly examines the unconscious Jamie's shoulder, discovering a clean gunshot wound. She declares that she must disinfect it to protect it from germs, but the group doesn't understand what she means. She asks for ""iodine? Merthiolate?"" Blank looks. ""Alcohol?"" she demands, in exasperation. Relieved to understand one of her demands, they thrust a flask at her, and she pours alcohol on the wound, trying to clean it. Jamie jerks into consciousness. She scolds him for re-injuring his shoulder, and turns to demand clean bandages. More blank looks, and, muttering her favorite oath, ""Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!"", she bends to rip the hem of her dress for a bandage. As she tries to tie the bandage on, she lets loose with another exasperated curse at the slipping bandage, ""you bloody bastard!"". The men mutter disapprovingly, Dougal declaring he has never heard a woman use such language, and another suggests that her husband should beat her. Another intones that ""Saint Paul says 'Let a woman be silent,'"" but Claire is out of patience and snaps, ""You can mind your own bloody business, and so can Saint Paul!"" The men, shocked, are silent. She turns to Jamie and threatens to throttle him if he moves. He grins. ""Threats, is it? And after I shared my drink with you?"" Dougal tells Claire they have five to seven more hours to ride, and they can't stay there much longer. When she protests, Jamie explains that Captain Randall has probably sent out patrols, she asks if he knows Black Jack Randall. After a moments hesitation, he admits that he knows him, and if she can't fix him up well enough to ride, then they should leave him there with a loaded pistol ""so I can determine my own fate."" Quiet, she thinks about what he has said and then, more softly, asks why he didn't tell her he had been shot. ""It didn't hurt much at the time,"" he shrugs. She tugs the bandage. ""Does it hurt now?"" ""Aye."" She looks him in the eye. ""Good."" He laughs, and accepting her help to stand, he thanks her.

To her surprise, they are riding towards a looming and intact Castle Leoch, a castle bustling with activity. Confused, she remembers visiting the derelict castle two days before, ""but how can I remember something that hasn't happened yet?"" she wonders. So far, she had been assaulted, threatened, kidnapped, and nearly raped, and as they enter the castle, she reflects ""and somehow, I knew that my journey had only just begun."""

As Claire wonders how to escape back to Inverness, the Master of Horse, Old Alec (Liam Carney), fusses at Rupert to take care of his horse's hooves because of his weight, and the housekeeper, Mrs. Fitzgibbons (Annette Badland), hugs members of the party, after teasing Murtagh that he ""looks and smells like a rat that's been dragged through sheep dung."" Murtagh takes the teasing good-naturedly, and gives her a kiss on the cheek. As Mrs. Fitzgibbons gets a glimpse of Claire, she stops and stares -- Claire is standing in the castle yard wearing her white dress, which is dirty and tattered from her misadventures. Jamie introduces them, and Mrs. Fitzgibbons hurries her inside, with promises of food and something to wear ""that's more . . . well, more,"" she finishes, with a shake of her head. Claire protests that Jamie needs medical attention and asks for supplies, and Mrs. Fitzgibbons asks her if she's a charmer or a Beaton. ""Mrs. Fitz"" provides Claire with herbs and bandages and a quiet place by a fire, and Claire begins to tend to Jamie's shoulder. As she removes Jamie's shirt, she is shocked by the severe scarring on his back. Jamie explains that he has been flogged twice -- he thinks it was twice on the same day -- by Captain Randall. Claire asks why he was flogged, and Jamie explains that the first time, he was escaping Fort William. ""Why were you escaping in the first place?"" Claire asks, and Jamie grins and replies, ""They were holding me prisoner!"" When Claire continues to prod for information, Jamie tells her that he had been arrested for obstruction.

Flashback: Jamie explains that Captain Randall and a troop of soldiers came to their home to take supplies such as food for their troops. His father was away at a funeral, and while Jamie was working in the field, he heard his sister, Jenny (Laura Donnelly), screaming. Racing to the house, he discovered Jenny being attacked by two of the soldiers. He begins to fight with the soldiers as Jenny dashes away, but she is intercepted by Captain Randall, who holds a knife to her throat and tells Jamie to stop. Discovering that Jenny is Jamie's sister, Captain Randall becomes more interested in her, and a casual caress turns into tearing off her bodice and exposing her bare-breasted to the soldiers and Jamie. Randall decides to make an example of Jamie, and hangs him up to be whipped, with Jenny tearfully watching. Randall offers to stop the whipping if Jenny will go into the house ""and offer him better entertainment."" Jamie exhorts Jenny not to give in to Randall, even if Randall kills him. Randall knocks him unconscious and Jamie conclude his story: ""And so, she went with him. She thought he'd kill me, and perhaps she was right . . ."" He describes being taken to Fort William, ""trussed up with the chickens.""

Claire is sympathetic, and as she continues to tend to Jamie, he tells her that she is a kind woman with a good touch, and that her husband is a lucky man. She turns away abruptly to stare in the fire, and tears up, worrying about what Frank is going through in the future, looking for her. Jamie questions her softly, and through her tears, she tells him that her husband is not alive. Jamie gives her a comforting hug as she continues to sob, and then she steps back, embarrassed. Jamie tells her not to be afraid because he will protect her, but when Claire asks what she should do if he's not with her, he warns her that, being English, she should be very careful. He tells her to get some sleep -- she's exhausted.

Later, Mrs. Fitz throws open the bedcurtains and cries for Claire to wake up. ""You've slept the whole day -- it's nigh five o'clock!"" Busily, Mrs. Fitz provides broth by the fire, water for washing, and brings Claire a proper dress. As Claire undresses, Mrs. Fitz is curious about her bra -- ""What kind of corset is that?"" she inquires. ""A brassiere . . it's French . . ."" Claire explains awkwardly, and Mrs. Fitz shakes her head and begins to help Claire dress, and when she is tidied up to Mrs. Fitz's satisfaction, she is escorted to meet with Colum Mackenzie.

As she wanders around his empty office, filled with colorful tapestries and birds in several cages, she sees a letter dated 1743. She is surprised, and has to hide further surprise when Colum MacKenzie, the laird of Castle Leoch, enters the room on legs that are severely disfigured by what would later be called Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome, or pycnodysostosis. Still, he is no one's fool, and as he greets Claire politely, he is intensely curious about how she came to be wandering in the woods. She remembers Frank once telling her that during an interrogation, she should stick to the facts as much as possible, so she tells Colum a tale about being accosted by bandits who stole her baggage and she became separated from her manservant and was lost. Colum is skeptical that Randall would simply rape a woman wandering lost in the woods, and apologizes after Claire asks tersely ""when is a good time for a rape?"" When Claire asks for help returning to Inverness, Colum tells her a tinker by the name of Sean Petry will be there in five days, and she can ride back to Inverness with him. Business concluded, Colum offers her the hospitality of the castle.

Claire is excited at the prospect of returning, and wanders around the castle, observing Dougal playing at swords with a young boy. Later that evening, Claire joins the castle folk for dinner, uncomfortably aware that conversation stops when she enters the room as everyone examines her. She makes her way to the head table and makes a small curtsy to Colum, and is invited to sit at his left at the head table. He introduces her to his wife, Letitia (Aislin McGuckin) and, plying her with several glasses of wine, he continues to question her as to where she is going (""France""), who she knows there, (""No one, family I haven't met yet.""). Claire discovers through Dougal and Colum's discussion that Jamie has been sent to work in the stables. Soon, the young boy she saw in the yard with Douglas comes in, and Claire greets him, saying that she had seen him playing with his father. The room grows silent, and then the boy, Hamish (Roddy Gilkison), tells her haughtily that he is the son and heir of Colum MacKenzie, and Claire realizes that she has made a mistake and, pleading tiredness, she excuses herself. As she makes her way to her room, she berates herself for allowing herself to be affected by too much wine, which has muddled her wits.

The next morning, she asks Mrs. Fitz where Jamie is, and is knowingly pointed to the stables. She admires Jamie in the ring training a horse, but distracts the horse, causing it to rear. Jamie is annoyed until he sees the cause of the horse's distraction. They share a lunch in the stable as she tends his bandage, and he tells her that he can't return to his own farm because there's a price on his head, 10 pounds sterling, on a trumped up charge of murder. ""You're a very complicated man, Mr. MacTavish,"" Claire says thoughtfully, and he admits that his real name isn't MacTavish, but since he doesn't want to be turned over to the English, he's been an outlaw for almost four years. When Claire wonders if Colum knows his story, Jamie laughs and tells her that Colum and Dougal are his uncles, on his mother's side, and know the whole story. Claire is surprised that Jamie has told her, and he tells her that he trusts her. Old Alec tells Jamie to get back to work, and as Claire starts back, she realizes that Rupart has been following her. When she objects, he tells her that Dougal has him watching her. Claire confronts Dougal, who tells her that he thinks she is an English spy, and she tells him she hopes enjoying watching her do nothing before she leaves with Mr. Petry.

Waiting to leave, she helps Mrs. Fitz harvest plants. One days, as she is picking mushrooms, she encounters Geillis Duncan (Lotte Verbeek), who teases her that she is picking poisonous mushrooms. Geillis tells her that people in the town think that Claire is an English spy. She goes on to tell Claire that she dabbles in herb for some people, and pointing out herbs that can cause miscarriages, she invites Claire to visit her in the village.

That evening is The Hall, a meeting at the castle where people bring their grievances to Colum for judgement. Geillis helps translate the conversations, and at the end, a young girl is brought before Colum by her father to be punished for loose behavior. Colum agrees, but before the girl can be strapped, Jamie steps forward and offers to take the beating for her. After a spirited argument, Colum agrees to the switch, and the girl, Laoghaire (Nell Hudson), tearfully runs to Mrs. Fitz's arms as Jamie prepares for the beating. Claire is horrified, knowing that Jamie is still injured. Murtagh warns Jamie and Dougal is up to something, and Jamie takes several blows before the beating is finished. Claire accompanies him back to Mrs. Fitz' fireside, where Mrs. Fitz thanks Jamie for saving her granddaughter from being humiliated, and leaves Claire to treat him.

Claire asks him why he did it. He admits that he barely knows her, but it would have shamed the lass, and it was easier for him -- he's sore, but not badly damaged, and he'll be better in a couple of days. She tells him to take the bandage off in a couple of days, and when he tells her that she can do it for him, she tells him that she will be leaving. He pauses, and then, with good manners, wishes her a safe journey. Claire, noticing Laoghaire peering around the door, smiles and takes her leave, nodding towards the door and observing to Jamie that ""someone wants to talk to him alone.""

The next morning, as Claire is beginning to leave with the tinker and a basket full of Mrs. Fitz' goodies, she is intercepted by Dougal, who tells her that Colum wants to see her. Protesting that she was just leaving, Dougal shakes his head and tells her that Colum has asked for her, and that settles it. He leads her to a chamber -- which Claire recognizes from her encounter with Frank as they toured the Castle Leoch ruins. Colum tells her that he has discovered that she is a good healer, and that since their last healer, a Beaton (a family famous for their healing talents) died and left behind all his potions and records in this room, he wants her to remain at the castle as their new healer -- and until he can find out who she really is. Angrily, she accuses him of trying to keep her prisoner, to which he responds softly, ""Only if you try to leave."" He steps out of the infirmary, leaving Claire alone and frightened."

Frank is frustrated: ""This is backwards -- I am the one that should be leaving for the front lines,"" he grouses as Claire climbs onto the train. A last loving farewell, and a worried Frank implores Claire, ""Claire Beauchamp Randall, promise that you'll return to me."" Claire smiles, and promises, ""I will, Frank Randall, I promise."" The train picks up steam, separating the husband and wife.

Flash to Claire in 1743: Mrs. Fitz is helping Claire bathe, and has just dumped a bucketful of cold water over a gasping Claire's head. Claire protests that she can wash and dress herself, but Mrs. Fitz brushes off her objections. and compliments Claire's skin, ""Such beautiful skin you have, I've never seen a woman past 8 or 9 to have skin so unmarked by injury or illness -- your next husband will be a lucky man!"" Startled, Claire is overcome by her situation, and tries to confide in Mrs. Fitz that her husband isn't really dead, that she seems to have fallen through time, and that she's from the future. Mrs. Fitz reacts badly, backing warily away from Claire and hysterically accusing her of being a witch.

Flash to Claire, sitting in front of a mirror as Mrs. Fitz is brushing her hair out. We realize that the previous two scenes were Claire's thoughts as she sits quietly in front of the mirror -- remembering Frank, and imagining Mrs. Fitz' reaction if she told her the truth of her situation. Mrs. Fitz is cheerfully chattering about the upcoming Gathering, where hundreds of clansmen will be arriving at the castle in the next few weeks to ""plight their oath"", and Mrs. Fitz reminds Clare that if she does a good job of ""physicking"" the ill and injured during the Gathering, she will earn Colum's good will.

In the surgery, Claire goes over notes from the previous healer, realizing how much of the medical ""knowledge"" is unsound, and trying to determine how to apply twentieth century medical practices in the eighteenth century. Her interest in botany becomes more and more important, as she determines how to use them effectively. She is under constant surveillance by Rupert and Angus as she works, but eventually, they drift over to the nearby kitchen to help themselves to the ale. One day, as Claire enters the kitchen, one of the women, obviously distraught, drops a bowl. Mrs. Fitz comforts her and sends her home, and tells Claire that the woman is Colum's chambermaid, and that her son died the night before. Claire is surprised no one came to fetch her to help him, but Mrs. Fitz tells her that it wasn't an ordinary sickness -- the boy had been playing around ""the Black Kirk"", a deserted Benedictine monastery, and as a result, had been taken over by a demon. ""He was a sickly boy on his best day -- he was no match for Ol' Nick"" Mrs. Fitz intones, making a fervent sign of the cross. At that moment, Mrs. Fitz' young nephew, Thomas Baxter, comes to fetch Claire to Colum's suite, and tells her that the boy who died was ""like a brother to him.""

As Claire enters Colum's room, his tailor is finishing the fitting of a new coat. Colum is angered by the tailor's attempt to hide his misshapen legs with a too-long coat, and demands a coat of a proper length. The terrified tailor hastens out, and Colum asks Claire to massage his legs, which are hurting him. As he lays down on a table, he asks if she, too, finds his legs as repellent as the tailor did, but she assures him no, but the massage would be more effective at the base of his spine. Nonchalantly, he flips up the hem of his shirt, exposing his bare bottom, and inquires sarcastically, ""Don't tell me my arse offends you, too!"" Claire smiles, and gets to work. They chat quietly about the death of his chambermaid's son -- Colum declares it was Satan's work, after the foolish boy went to the Black Kirk, and then, reflectively, he wonders what he, himself, did to make the devil punish him with his misshapen legs. Claire gives a small ""hmph"", and Colum inquires, ""What, you don't have demons in Gloucestershire, Mistress?"" ""Yes,"" says Claire with a smile, ""but we call them Scots!"" Colum grunts in amusement, and, relieved of pain by Claire's ministrations, invites her to the Hall that night as his guest to listen to the bard perform.

That evening, Claire is standing off to the side as the Hall begins to fill. Dougal comes up behind her and compliments her on her work with Colum, observing that Colum seems to feel much better. ""Seems like the feral cat we picked up on the road has decided to pull in her claws,"" he continues. Offended, Claire moves away. Finding herself sitting next to the young girl who narrowly avoided a beating on Claire's first day at Castle Leoch, Claire introduces herself to Laoghaire MacKenzie, but Laoghaire's attention is longingly drawn to Jamie's entrance. Claire notices, and gives a little wave at Jamie, who sees her and begins to cross the room to join them. ""It's not me he fancies,"" says Laoghaire, softly. Claire smiles and tells her that ""men seldom know what is best for them, that's what women are for!"" and makes room for Jamie between herself and Laoghaire. Jamie is polite to Laoghaire's attempts at conversation, but it is obvious that he is not focused on her, much to her chagrin. After a few songs, Claire has been sipping Colum's strong Rhenish wine, and Jamie comments that most people are under the table after two glasses. When she asks if he thinks she is intoxicated, he smiles and says, ""I'd be surprised if you weren't!"" and takes the third glass from her and drinks. Jamie complains that his bandage is chafing and asks Claire to look at it, Hurriedly thrusting the empty glass at a disgruntled Laoghaire, Claire and Jamie leave to visit the surgery. As she asks him about his bandage, he admits that he doesn't need any help, but wanted to see her back to the surgery ""while she could still walk upright."" Blushing, Claire thanks him, realizing that if he wanted the bandage off, he would have just taken it off himself. She asks him why he didn't ask her to remove it at the stables, and he admits that he didn't want Alec to see the scars on his back. He tells her that he doesn't mind her seeing the scars, because she has a way of ""letting him know that she's sorry for it, but not making her feel pitiful for it."" Before he leaves, she examines his bandage, carefully unwinding his stock, and pronounces his wound as almost healed.

The next day, Claire and Geillis are gathering herbs, and Geillis tells her that Thomas Baxter has fallen ill, and Father Bain is going to perform an exorcism. Claire is skeptical that the illness is caused by demons, but Geillis asks her if she doesn't believe in demonic possession. ""Do you?"" asks Claire. Geillis tells her that she believes that there are ""powers beyond our ken, beyond what we can see and hear and touch . . . have you never found yourself in a situation with no earthly explanation?"" Claire is convinced that the boy may just be ill, but Geillis warns her that to challenge the belief that the boy is possessed will put her in danger, herself. Undeterred, Claire hurries to Thomas' home, to find Thomas tied to a bed with a frantic Mrs. Fitz in attendance. Examining the boy, Claire begins to think he may have been poisoned, but they are interrupted by Father Bain and Thomas' mother, who is appalled that Mrs. Fitz has let a ""stranger"" in. Even though Claire entreats her to allow her to help Thomas, she refuses, and Claire eases out the door as Father Bain proceeds with the exorcism.

At dinner, Claire teases Jamie over his slightly swollen lips, knowing that he has probably been kissing Laoghaire. Embarrassed, Jamie leaves the table, but Claire is quietly admonished by Jamie's friend that if Laoghaire's father finds out, Jamie may be forced to marry her, ""but he needs a woman, not a lassie, Laoghaire will still be a girl when until she's 50."" Claire feels badly for teasing Jamie, realizing that she is jealous of Jamie and Laoghaire's intimacy and misses that same intimacy with Frank. Wandering outside, she is sitting by herself when Dougal finds her, and offers to take her into town the next day to visit Geillis and stock up on supplies for the Gathering.

The next day, visiting Geillis, they discuss Thomas' condition, and Father Bain's disdain of women. As they talk, they hear a noise in the town square, and notice Father Bain dragging a young boy through the square amidst shouting. Geillis is unconcerned, noting that it's the tanner's boy, who has probably been caught stealing again, and that her husband, the fiscal, will have to pass judgement on him. When Claire inquires what will happen, she is shocked when Geillis admits that, since her husband isn't feeling well, the boy will probably lose his hand. Claire is incredulous, but they are interrupted by the appearance of Geillis' husband, Arthur, complaining of belly pains. Geillis is solicitous, and offers him a peppermint potion which seems to help. Claire tries to talk him out of cutting off the boy's hand, but Geillis interrupts with sweet, honeyed words that convinces Arthur to lessen the sentence to an hour in the pillory with his ear nailed to the pillory. Arthur trots away to render judgement, and Geillis is matter-of-fact: ""The man has no notion of guile,"" she observes dispassionately. The boy's ear is nailed to the post, and everyone wanders away. Geillis and Claire settle down for a chat, but are interrupted by Jamie coming to fetch Claire back to the castle. As they are leaving, Claire quietly asks Jamie how long the tanner's boy has to stay nailed, and Jamie tells her that he has to tear himself loose. Horrified, Claire asks him how strong his fingers are. Understanding her meaning, Jamie mounts the scaffold to tease the tanner's boy. Claire, feigning a fainting spell, distracts the crowd for a moment to allow Jamie to quickly pull the nail out and free the boy. On their way home, Claire asks Jamie to help her on another matter.

They stop by the Black Kirk, and Jamie tells her that young boys, including him at one point, often come to the kirk to prove their manhood by tempting fate, sometimes eating berries or the wood garlic found on the grounds. Clare is immediately interested, and asks him to show her the wood garlic. Upon inspection, she discovers that what Jamie -- and probably the boys -- thought was wood garlic is actually lily of the valley, which is poisonous when ingested. Jamie has never heard of lily of the valley, and Claire admits that it's not native to Scotland, then remembers that the monks who previously inhabited the monastery were from Germany -- ""no, Prussia,"" and probably imported it. Claire hurries away, with a puzzled Jamie trailing behind.

Later, Claire re-enters the Baxter's house, where Father Bain is performing another exorcism on a fading Thomas. Claire urgently explains what she thinks has happened to Thomas' mother. Father Bain interrupts, declairing that he is the Lord's disciple, she is not ordained to drive away the demon and orders her out of the house. She refuses, trying to explain that she means no blasphemy, but that the boy's problem is poison, not a demon. Mrs. Fitz quietly tells Father Bain to let Claire tend to Thomas, but Father Bain declares he will not be ordered about by a woman. Angrily, Mrs. Fitz tells him that this is her sister's house, and her father's before that, and ""We will decide what is done under it's roof!"" Keeping her eyes locked on Father Bain, Mrs. Fitz directs Claire to take care of Thomas, but as she tries to pass, Father Bain snarls at her, ""I smell the vapors of hell on you!"" Claire shrugs him off, and quickly pours a belladonna decoction down Thomas' throat. Everyone gathers around to see if it works, Claire agonizes over whether she got the dose right, whether the strength of the medicine she uses was enough or too much, but Thomas responds quickly, to everyone's joy. Mrs. Fitz fervently thanks Claire, but Father Bain is unimpressed, telling Claire that ""the devil likes to make a fool of God, but God will have the last word - I promise you that.""

Afterwards, Claire is at the stables talking to Jamie as he grooms a horse, telling him what happened, and wondering if Father Bain would have rather seen Thomas die. Jamie observes that Father Bain has his own way of making sense out of the world, and tries to cheer Claire up by telling her that Mrs. Fitz has told Colum that Claire is a miracle worker. Claire wonders if that will earn her a measure of trust, but to her dismay, Jamie observes that it will probably make Colum want to keep her and her skills at Castle Leoch. ""I'll never get out of here!"" she exclaims in frustration, to Jamie's bemusement.

That evening, Claire almost decides to skip the Hall's entertainment, because she is aware of the looks of awe and suspicion that follow her wherever she goes. She decides to join them and seek oblivion in Colum's excellent wine, but is melancholy -- she sees no way to escape, and even if she does escape, there's no guarantee that the stones will take her back home to Frank - they may take her another two hundred years further in the past, or even as far back as the Roman occupation of Britain. But Jamie encourages her to sit with him, and as the bard sings, he translates the song for her: It's about a man, ""on the eve of Samhein, who hears the sound of a woman singing sad and plaintive, from the very rocks of hell. 'I am a woman of Balmain,'"" and proceeds to tell the story of a woman who ""placed her hands upon the stone and traveled to a far distant land, where I lived for a time among strangers who became lovers and friends,"" but eventually traveled back through the stones to the man she loved. Claire listens, entranced. ""She came back through the stones?"" she asks incredulously. ""Aye, she did,"" Jamie nods, ""they always do."" Claire realizes that the folk talk being sung by the bard is probably based on a distant true tale and is suddenly hopeful and resolute: She will escape Castle Leoch and return to the stones and Frank -- or die trying."

MacKenzie sentries on wooden towers take aim with their muskets at the sounds coming from the forest, but relax when Claire appears with several of the castle children in pursuit. Their hunting game is soon put to an end by Claire's ever-present guards who want to return to the festivities of the gathering. Rupert (Grant O'Rourke) implores Claire to return saying there hasn't been a gathering since he was a bairn. Claire acquiesces and they head back to Castle Leoch. As they return we hear Claire's thoughts in voiceover that the hunting game is a pleasant diversion that allows her to unobtrusively reconnoiter the castle grounds for escape routes. Having found and marked two such routes with bits of her hair ribbon and clothing, Claire now only needs to find something to distract Rupert and Angus (Stephen Walters) so that she can make good her escape that night. One distraction presents itself shortly when she spots a woman (Victoria Taggart) in the gathering encampment who seems to fancy one of the men. Claire mentions this and a dispute erupts between the two men as to who gets to reciprocate that interest. Claire settles things with a game of ""pulling sticks"" that Angus wins. Claire and a visibly unhappy Rupert head to the stables ostensibly to choose a mount for tomorrow's hunt, while Claire explains in voiceover that she wants a gentle mount to use in her escape as it has been years since she has ridden a horse. Telling Alec (Liam Carney) that she has come to get a mount for the next day's hunt, which she, as castle healer, is to attend, he leads her to a filly with the unlikely name of Brimstone. Alec assures Claire the horse is misnamed, saying, ""its like calling a big man wee."" He assures Claire that Brimstone is really a good, gentle horse that will turn for home at the first opportunity. While discussing her mount with Alec, Claire learns that Jamie (Sam Heughan) is not about and is told by Alec that it is for the best for all concerned if Jamie keeps to himself until the gathering is over.

Having found her mount, Claire returns to the surgery where she is startled by Geillis (Lotte Verbeek) who was waiting for her. Geillis gives Claire a bottle of port she had requested and then proceeds to ask several very probing and discomfiting questions, clearly trying to pry from Claire answers she doesn't want to give. Geillis is obviously suspicious of Claire, asking her if she needs so much food because she is with bairn and questioning her about her husband who Claire, upon Geillis pushing her on the subject, finally asserts is dead rather than just ""not alive."" Geillis notices that Claire has a large amount of valerian root, enough, she says, ""to put an army to sleep till the next moon."" Claire excuses herself saying she must return to her preparations for the hunt. Geillis leaves, but not before remarking that the Highlands are no place for a woman alone.

As soon as Geillis is out of sight Claire prepares her bundle of food and heads for the kitchen in search of a weapon, stating in voiceover that all of the fighting men of Clan MacKenzie would be at the oath-taking ceremony that night making it her one and only chance to escape Castle Leoch and return to Craigh Na Dun. As she enters the kitchen she espies Angus eating a bite, and, through an open door, spots Rupert very much involved with the woman they had encountered earlier. Angus shrugs and Claire continues to the kitchen work area where she locates a knife. As she is about to hide the knife up her sleeve, Mrs. Fitz (Annette Badland) suddenly appears. Claire quickly slides the knife in amongst the clutter of the work table as Mrs. Fitz asks if she intends to wear what she has on to the ceremony. Claire states that she assumes a Sassenach would not be welcome, but Mrs. Fitz insists that she must attend since she is Colum's special guest and ushers Claire off to find suitable clothing.

Later, outfitted in a beautiful plaid and flower-embroidered gown with matching choker, Claire follows Mrs. Fitz upstairs to the gallery to observe the oath-taking. In voiceover Claire states she had realized that having Mrs. Fitz as chaperone for the oath-taking was actually a good thing that might make Rupert and Angus less vigilant and cause them to relax their guard on her. As they reach the gallery, Mrs. Fitz spies old acquaintance Iona McTavish (Diana Gabaldon) and they exchange a few edgy remarks hinting at a possible dislike existing between the two. Mrs. Fitz then greets Murtagh (Duncan Lacroix) and draws him to the rail with Claire and herself where they observe Colum's (Gary Lewis') entrance into the hall. To the accompaniment of a bagpiper Colum makes a grand entrance and takes his place on the dais, giving a rousing speech in Gaelic, which Murtagh translates for Claire. Afterwards, Dougal (Graham McTavish) is the first to pledge his loyalty to Colum as laird. He pledges on his dirk, then kisses Colums extended hands, and drinks from the quaich of whiskey offered to him by Colum who then drinks from it himself. Dougal rises and heads to the back of the hall where he takes a big drink from an offered bottle as the rest of the clansmen line up to pledge their oaths to his brother.

As the oath-taking continues, Claire excuses herself saying ""if you have seen one..."" Downstairs she encounters Angus, who has just given his oath, and tells him she is heading for her surgery to continue preparing for the hunt. Angus argues and pleads with her to stay and enjoy the festivities. Seeming to give in, Claire produces the bottle of port, takes a drink and offers it to Angus. Chortling over her behavior Angus takes the bottle and drinks long from it. As he does so, Claire turns and unobtrusively spits onto the floor the valerian-laced port she was holding in her mouth. Angus remarks that the wine is ""no Rhenish,"" Claire revealing to him that it is port. ""'Tis quite strong,"" Angus says, ""I can't keep my legs about me."" ""It is a sedative,"" Claire replies. ""Is that Spanish?"" Angus inquires. Claire encourages him to keep the bottle and share it with all his friends. As he wanders off looking for female company, forgetting about Claire, she says in voiceover ""the more unconscious clansmen tonight, the better.""

Finally getting back to the surgery, Claire gathers her things and is on her way out the door when she almost bumps into Laoghaire (Nell Hudson) who has come to seek her help with a problem. Asking what she can do for her, Laoghaire responds shyly that she was wondering if Claire might have a potion that would open a lad's heart to a lassie. Claire realizes she is speaking of Jamie and says that when last she saw them together Laoghaire didn't seem to be having any problem holding Jamie's attention. Laoghaire answers that it isn't ""that"" for which she needs the potion, but she wishes something to move his heart forward. Claire hurries back into the surgery and scoops some dried horse dung into a bottle saying to herself that it is harmless and Jamie will never know the difference. Giving the potion to Laoghaire, she tells her to sprinkle it on Jamie's threshold, tap her heels together three times, and recite ""there's no place like love, there's no place like love,"" having obviously seen ""The Wizard of Oz"" in 1939 England. Laoghaire thanks her and they go their separate ways.

As Claire makes her way out of the castle she encounters three drunken clansmen near the kitchen who try to force their attentions on her. She knees one, but cannot fight the others off. Dougal suddenly appears and removes Claire from their grasp, saying something to them in Gaelic that causes them to leave. Dougal is very drunk and Claire, becoming uneasy, states that she should leave. Dougal stops her saying she must now pay a penalty, and kissing her, starts to fumble with raising her skirts only to be soundly slapped by Claire. Reason restored, Dougal tells her to ""get ye gone, lass."" Claire looks for the bundle she dropped and sees it by Dougal's feet. He follows her gaze and is bending to pick it up when Claire hits him over the head with a stool, knocking him out. She retrieves her bundle and quickly leaves, making her way across the courtyard to the stables.

Claire hurries through the stables toward Brimstone's stall and trips over Jamie (Sam Heughan) , asleep in the hay, who comes awake holding his dirk to her throat. ""Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ,"" Claire croaks, and Jamie replies, ""No, Sassenach, just me."" He sees her bundle, and, picking it up, asks her how far she thought she would get on a dark night, with a strange horse and with half of the clan MacKenzie after her by morning. She replies that they wouldn't be after her - they were all up at the hall and she would be surprised if one in five of them were sober enough to stand in the morning let alone ride a horse. Jamie remarks that she is running away on a whim just because the men are drunk and Claire replies that it isn't a whim, he knows she has wanted to leave Castle Leoch for weeks. She tells him she knows exactly how many sentry posts are around the castle as well as how to find her way through the woods and find the road back to Inverness. ""That's a very sound plan, Sassenach, or it would be, did Colum not post extra guards through the woods tonight. He would hardly leave the castle undefended with all of the fighting men of the clan inside it."" Claire defiantly states that she is going anyway and walks toward Brimstone's stall. An exasperated Jamie calls after her that the best trackers in the clan are present and that they will find her. ""Colum will not be calling you guest after that,"" he concludes. A visibly upset Claire states that no one should care since she is, as he stated, just an outlander, a Sassenach. Jamie says he is sorry if he offended her and Claire responds that she knows he didn't mean it that way, she is just upset to have her hope of the escape she had been planning for some time shot to hell in a moment's time. Jamie takes her bundle and gently says he will see her back to the castle, beginning to walk away. Claire doesn't budge, saying she doesn't think that is a good idea and tells him about her encounter with the drunken clansmen. He asks if they touched her and she responds by saying that she cannot go back and tells him of her encounter with Dougal. ""Dougal and I were in the corridor near the kitchen. He was being forward with me, and I may have walloped him over the head with a chair or something. I think he's unconscious."" Jamie asks if Dougal was drunk and Claire responds ""Very."" Jamie laughs and tells her he doubts very much that Dougal will remember the incident, and, even if he does, he will not want to admit that a lass got the better of him. He playfully nudges her with his shoulder, ""You knocked him out cold, hunh?"" ""I didn't exactly stick around to examine him."" ""Well, I hope you left a good mark so he'll remember his error in judgment. It's fine, Sassenach. Come."" Taking her hand he leads her to a secret tunnel leading into the castle he had discovered as a child. At the tunnel entrance they stop to exchange a few words of thanks and are caught by the castle guards. Recognizing Jamie as Colum's nephew the men say he has come late to the oath-taking and that he wouldn't want to miss his turn in front of himself. Desperately Jamie tells them he is not decent to attend dressed as he is and asks leave to go to the cottage and change, but is told they can outfit him proper inside. The clansman holding Claire asks to keep the lassie, and Jamie knocks him out with a cry to ""let the lady go."" Asking if she is all right, Claire cries out a warning too late as Rupert knocks Jamie over the head.

In the castle, appropriate clothing for the ceremony is provided to Jamie who tells Rupert he didn't need to hit him so hard, he was willing to come, to which Rupert responds that he didn't want Jamie maiming half the clan while he was making up his mind. Rupert gives him a brooch for his kilt. Claire translates the Latin ""Luceo non oro"" on the brooch as ""I shine, not burn"" and is told it is the MacKenzie clan motto. As the others talk, Claire apologizes to Jamie who was hit while standing up for her. He tells her not to fash herself on his account stating that his sister says his head is hard as an iron pot. Holding the brooch, he tells Claire he cannot wear it because he's not a MacKenzie. Asking if Claire knows his clan motto, which she doesn't because she doesn't even know what clan he is from, he tells her it is ""je suis prest"" and drops the MacKenzie brooch into a bucket of water. Jamie tells Claire to find a place in the hall. As she leaves we again hear her thoughts in voiceover, ""Je suis prest. I am ready. But ready for what?""

Claire enters the hall as the oath-taking continues and we see Angus struggling to stay awake. Approaching Murtagh Claire can see over his shoulder that Jamie is approaching the main entrance. Claire whispers to Murtagh, ""Jamie's here."" Startled, Murtagh turns to look, as do many others in the hall. Claire asks why everyone is so tense and Murtagh shushes her, drawing her aside to explain. He tells her that if Jamie pledges fealty to Colum he becomes part of Clan MacKenzie and would be in line to become laird. He explains that clans are tanist, so if enough clansmen wanted Jamie as laird, they would elect him. Claire says she thinks Mr. McTavish would make a good laird, but Murtagh says that was an honor Dougal had been holding for himself when Colum dies. Should Jamie swear his oath to Colum, Dougal wouldn't let him breathe MacKenzie air for long. Claire asks why Jamie doesn't just refuse to take the oath and Murtagh tells her that while he abides at Leoch and as the laird's nephew and a healthy man of arms, he has no choice. Should he refuse to do so before all, the maids would likely be scrubbing Jamie's blood from the floor at Colum's feet. ""No matter what he decides he winds up dead? Why stay at the castle, why doesn't he just leave if both of his uncles would have his head on a pike?"" ""He's got a price on his head. The only safe place in Scotland is here, at Leoch. Until now. If Jamie had just stayed hidden until the gathering is over, Colum and Dougal wouldn't have pressed the matter any further."" ""Leaving the stables to escort me back. Oh God, this is all my fault!"" Claire says as she turns to see what happens. ""Aye, it tis,"" Murtagh agrees.

As Jamie enters the hall, Dougal appears rubbing the back of his head. They eye one another as both make their way to Colum. Jamie is the last in line and is clearly troubled. He hesitates, then takes a knee before Colum, but continues to look down, saying nothing, trying to decide what to do. At last he rises and faces Colum. As he does so, Dougal's grip on his dirk tightens. ""Colum MacKenzie, I come to you as kinsman and as ally, but I give you no vow, for my oath is pledged to the name that I bear."" At this several clansmen start to unsheathe their dirks. Stepping closer to Colum, Jamie says, ""I give you my obedience as kinsman, and as laird. And I hold myself bound to your word, so long as my feet rest on the lands of the Clan MacKenzie."" Colum stares at Jamie, then turns, picks up the quaich, and, smiling, offers it to Jamie. Jamie smiles in relief and takes the vessel with a quick bow of his head, than proceeds to drain the entire thing to the cheers of the clan. Colum says something loudly in Gaelic and bagpipes and dancing begin immediately. Colum and Dougal exchange a meaningful look as Jamie makes his way through the throng to Murtagh's side, nodding at Claire as he approaches. ""I'm getting too old for this,"" Murtagh states as Jamie reaches him. Jamie and Murtagh take their leave of Claire, who turns away, and Jamie casts one last look at her before exiting through a side door.

The next day is the boar tynchal. Claire approaches Rupert as he sharpens his spear stating that ""this is a quite a show of force for a pig hunt."" ""It's a boar."" ""Oh, of course, twenty men armed with spears and muskets seems about right to me for one hairy pig."" ""You've clearly never seen one then. Get to your mount. Time to go."" The hunt begins as men on foot and horseback advance armed with spears, bows, and muskets, beating on their shields and yelling to drive the herd of boar before them. Suddenly a boar coming from cover startles a horse, unseating its rider who is then gored in the leg. Rupert hearing the man's cry of distress turns and runs to him calling for Mistress Claire as he goes.

We next see Claire bandaging the man's leg and berating him, saying, ""It serves you right, what did you expect the animal to do with you barbarians chasing it? Did you forget their tusks could be lethal?"" Assuring him he would not lose his leg, but would have a limp, she gives Rupert instructions for Mrs. Fitz and instructs him to take the man back to the castle. Suddenly, there is another scream up ahead. Claire tells Rupert to take the man back now and runs toward the cry. As she runs toward danger, a frustrated Rupert exhorts her to wait for him. Hurrying forward, Claire hears another cry and calls ""Where are you?"" Immediately, she hears the loud grunt of the boar and the rustling of the underbrush nearby. Frightened, she continues moving forward while turning in circles looking for the boar. A boar surges from the undergrowth to her right, just as a loud crack from a musket is heard. The boar drops dead mere feet from Claire who sees Dougal a short distance away holding a smoking musket. Another scream is heard ahead and Dougal moves off immediately toward the injured man. Claire takes a few moments to recover from her fright, then follows to find Dougal holding and comforting a clansman with a horrible gash in his thigh. As she applies a tourniquet Claire assures the man, Geordie (Bryan Larkin), that he will not lose his leg. She stops the bleeding, but discovers upon turning back his kilt that his intestines are exposed and we hear in voiceover that the wound to his stomach is fatal, she can stop the bleeding to his leg as it is not arterial, but it will only cause him to linger in agony. Shaking her head at Dougal, he reaches down and, out of sight of Geordie, releases the tourniquet, giving him a better death Claire states in voiceover. As Geordie begins to bleed out, Dougal and he talk of old times and Dougal confesses to having slept with Geordie's sister. Geordie is in great pain, but Claire tells him it will be better soon, the pain will be gone soon. Geordie replies that he can no longer feel his leg or his hands. Claire asks Geordie about his home and he describes it, saying he wishes he were there now. Dougal replies that he soon will be. He asks Dougal to stay with him and both he and Claire reply that they will. Geordie soon dies in Dougal's arms, and Dougal and Claire share a long look over his body.

Returning to the castle with Geordie's body draped over one horse and another dragging the carcass of the boar, they come upon the clansmen playing a rousing game of shinty. Dougal is in a rare mood after the death of Geordie, and, spying Jamie amongst the players, takes up a stick and charges toward him, hitting a man behind the legs and knocking another through a cooking fire as he goes. Jamie has the ball and Dougal hits him from behind. They fight over the ball, Dougal remarking that he taught Jamie this game to which Jamie responds, ""Aye, ye did."" Dougal hits Jamie in the stomach with his stick and steals the ball, then passes it to Angus. Murtagh takes the ball from Angus and, at Jamie's cry, passes it to him. Jamie is fielding the ball when Dougal hits him from behind again and knocks him down, stealing the ball in the process. Claire and Rupert are watching from the sidelines and Claire says to Rupert, ""That doesn't look very fair."" Jamie rises, saying, ""That's twice you've caught me napping"" and charges after Dougal, tackling him. Dougal lands on top and presses Jamie into the ground telling him to ""Yield,"" but Jamie says ""What would you think of me if I did?"" to which Dougal replies, ""Not much."" Dougal is soon up and off after the ball while Murtagh intercepts Angus who was trying to hit Jamie a blow that looked deadly while he was down, hitting Angus between the legs while telling him to ""Play fair, now!"" Jamie and Dougal lock sticks in the middle of the field after Dougal hits him from behind again. Jamie fends Dougal off by crossing their sticks, but Dougal manages to hit him several blows on either side of his body. Everyone stops and watches this little duel. Having finally had enough, Jamie uses the leverage of his stick crossed with Dougal's to heave Dougal over his head, flipping him onto his back. Throwing down his stick, Jamie offers Dougal a hand up with the words ""Ye taught me well."" Dougal says, ""Aye, too well"" and takes the offered hand, but not with good grace. Still locked at the forearm they glare in one another's faces before each throwing off the other's hand. Dougal turns and stalks off and Jamie looks across the field to Claire giving her a quick nod of salutation. Murtagh approaches him and they walk off companionably, Jamie asking ""Did we win?""

Later we see Claire grinding up herbs in her surgery, thinking in voiceover that, her escape plan thwarted, she fears being stuck in this dungeon forever. Not ready to give up, she needs time to come up with another plan. Dougal enters saying, ""You've seen men die before, and by violence."" Claire responds, ""Yes, many of them."" Dougal tells her she is doing a fine job as healer and thanks her for helping Geordie. Claire says that in truth she did nothing for him, but Dougal says she ""took him to a peaceful place which is all that any of us can ask when we pass."" He then tells her that he is going on the road the next day and plans to take her with him. Since Colum does not travel he is going out to visit the tenants who could not come to the gathering and to collect the rents. He thinks it wise to have a healer along who does well under strain as there is a lot of that on the road. Telling her they are leaving at first light he admonishes her not to be late for dinner so as not to anger Mrs. Fitz and then leaves.

The next dawn we see a group led by Dougal and including Jamie, Claire, Angus, Rupert, and Murtagh leaving the castle. In voiceover we hear Claire's thoughts that perhaps this journey will bring her closer to the standing stones of Craigh Na Dun and that, if so, she is determined to reach them, knowing this time, she must not fail."

Absently, she recites, outloud, a poem by John Dunne (1573-1631):

""Absence, hear thou my protestation Against thy strength, distance and length. Do what thou canst for alteration . . .""

She is surprised when Ned Gowan, Dougal's lawyer, quietly joins her and finishes the verse with her, ""For hearts of truest mettle, Absence doth still, and Time doth settle."" Ned confesses that John Dunne is one of his favorites. As the rest of the group is racously roughhousing and shouting merrily in Gaelic, Claire and Ned chat, and Claire asks Ned what they are talking about. Somewhat embarrased, Ned tells her that William is being teased because it is his first time on the road with them, and he is being encouraged to ""have Biblical relations . . . ah, with his sister."" Claire, used to the rough language of Army personnel, isn't shocked, and she and Ned stroll along the shore of lake. Ned tells her that he's along to care care of records and receipts. As he tucks something in to his horse's pack, Claire admires his portable desk. He describes how the rents are collected -- as grain, fowl, even goats, but admits that he has drawn the line this year -- no pigs. His persistent coughing draws Claire's attention, and diagnosing a case of asthma, she gives him some thornapple to smoke in his pipe and calm the coughing. As he begins to inhale, Claire thinks to herself that the thornapple -- also known as jimson-weed -- relieves the asthma symptoms. The treatment works quickly, and Dougal calls for the group to continue on down the road.

As they travel down the road, Ned and Claire continue to get to know each other. He tells her that he studied law in Edinburgh and had a nice office ""with lace curtains in the window and a shiny brass plaque with his name engraved on it,"" but wanted more adventure in his life, so he moved to the Highlands. Claire observes, to his amusement, that he may be a man of the law, but he has the soul of a romantic.

Claire enjoys getting to know Ned, but is still single-minded in her determination to return to the standing stones at Craig na Dun and the 20th century. When they stop to camp for the evening, she is an outsider as the rest of the party speaks only Gaelic -- she knows they are talking about her, and is annoyed that they are using the Gaelic to deliberately exclude her. Disconsolately, she reminds herself not to let it bother her, since she won't be there very long, but she still feels alone. Jamie joins her, and tells her not to let them bother her. ""They hate me,"" she mutters. Jamie acknowledges that they don't trust her. ""Well,"" he says with a wink, ""maybe Angus hates you -- but he hates everyone!"" Claire smiles at his attempt to cheer her. She asks him if he thinks she is a British spy, and he tells her no, but that he thinks that there are things that she isn't telling them, and that she had tried to run away during the Gathering -- and is still thinking about it, ""plain and clear."" Chagrined, Claire cuts the conversation short. ""It's been a long day,"" she says shortly, walking away from him. Jamie reminds her, ""You did ask,"" but she ignores him and goes to her tent.

The next day, at a village, Claire is bored, and watches Ned collect the rents. She notices that some money goes into a different pouch. Dougal is genial with the villagers, knowing most of them and their families by name. As one family brings a live pig for rent payment, Ned is unenthusiastic, and when Claire asks him about his vow of no pigs, he just shakes his head in resignation. With nothing to do, Claire begins to wander around the village, and tries to follow the source of some singing that she hears. She encounters one of the women, who asks if she needs help. Claire admits that the song is new to her, and the woman tells her that it's a working song, as they are working wool. Claire admits that she's not accustomed to be idle, and the woman notes that she has strong hands. ""Idle? We'll see about that . . ."" and invites Claire to follow her. They join a group of women merrily singing at a large worktable, and beating a length of wool. When the woman introduces Claire, the singing stops abruptly and scowls replace their earlier merriment. Uncomfortable, Claire takes a tentative seat, and joins in. As one of the women splash the wool with a liquid, Claire's nose wrinkles: ""That's pungent . . is that . . ?"" ""Aye, it's hot piss -- it sets the dye,"" confirms the woman matter-of-factly. They start another work song in Gaelic, and make room for Claire to sit with them -- Claire tentatively picks up the refrain and joins in with the working of the wool and the song.

After a long spell of working the wool, the women take a break, drinking a strong brew. A baby wakes up, crying, and Claire's new friend explains that the baby is hungry because it is teething, but they had to give the goat to the laird. Claire is disturbed. ""That doesn't seem fair,"" she mutters. Later, she asks if Craig na Dun is nearby, and discovers that it is three days away. One of the women tells a story about a man who swore he saw fairies there, but it turned out to be a sheep, instead. Everyone laughs, and then prepares to go back to work. But more hot piss is needed, and Claire is invited to ""contribute"" to the pot. A bit embarrassed, but willing, she lifts her skirts and squats over the pot -- just as an agitated Angus bursts in. He's been ""looking to hell and back for ye!"" and tells her that they are ready to go. When she protests that they aren't finished, he grabs her roughly and shoves her out the door. When she continues to protest, Angus observes that she's been drinking and smells like piss. ""Well, THAT'S the pot calling the kettle black!"" she retorts, snatching her arm away from him. They are both angry, and Angus threatens to tie her to the wagon. As they walk to the assembled wagons, she spots the goat. She snatches it and begins to lead it back to the women, to the protests of one of the party. They argue, and Angus observes that she's drunk. ""I am no such thing!"" she declares, fighting over the goat. Douglal appears, and asks Angus where he found her, and why is it so hard to keep track of one Sassenach. ""Slippery as an eel, that one!"" Angus protests, as Claire continues her tug-of-war over the goat. She confronts Dougal, asking if the goat is more important than letting the children go hungry, but Dougal is adamant -- the goat is payment, faire and square, and goes with them. Suddenly, a cultured British voice rings out: ""Madam, is everything all right? May I be of service?"" To her surprise, a young man, wearing a work apron, has appeared. Neatly groomed, he does not resemble the other wild-looking Highlanders, and his language is that of a gentleman. Angrily, Angus and Dougal tells him to mind his own business, but he persists, telling them that he is talking to the lady. ""The 'lady' is a guest of Clan MacKenzie,"" declares Dougal pointedly. ""Do you treat all your guests this way?"" the young man inquires. Angus tells him to ""bugger off"", and, after a few more insults and sizing up the unfriendly MacKenzie group, the young man decides the odds are against him and withdraws. Dougal orders her to mount up and get ready to leave -- no one notices that that young man ducks back into his hut and quickly dons a British officer's redcoat and tricorn hat.

That evening, Dougal is talking expansively to the villagers in the local tavern, as everyone laughs and relaxes. As one party leaves, the doors are locked, and the atmosphere changes noticeably. Dougal begins an earnest speech in Gaelic, which rises to a crescendo as he grasps Jamie's shirt and tears it from his back, exposing his scars from his lashing. The crowd gasps in horror, and after a few more words, the crowd starts contributing a few coins, which Ned carefully places in a pouch as Jamie sits in stoic fury. After the crowd leaves, Dougal reviews the take, and pronouces it a good sum for the size of the village. He pats Jamie on the back and chortles that ""with Jamie's back, it's as good as money in the bank!"" as Jamie winces. Gathering up the torn shirt, he tosses it at Claire, demanding that she mend it. Outraged at his actions, she throws the shirt back at him, telling him to mend it himself. Dougal, taking a long drink, sniffs and informs her that he won't be mending it, and Claire relents, stooping to gather the shirt from the floor. Tightly, Jamie declares that he will be mending his own shirt, and grabbing the torn shirt, angrily stomps out.

The next day, Claire sits apart from the group by a stream, and Ned brings her some black pudding, ""an acquired taste,"" and joins her. She accepts the sausage, and then takes him to task, asking him if he thinkgs that Colum would approve of him helping Dougal steal money from his tenants, and using his nephew Jamie to do it. Ned's face is impassive, but he acknowledges that she is a ""canny lassie."" Smugly, she goes on to say that she just wants to know how the system works. ""Two bags of money, obviously -- are there two sets of books as well? One for each brother?"" Ned acknowledges that she seems to have it all sorted out. Claire remarks that she didn't know that they taught common thievery at the University of Edinburgh. Ned tells her that she's got a good head on her shoulders and a tongue for argument. ""You'd make a fine advocate yourself -- it's a pity they don't allow women to practice law!"" ""Not yet,"" Claire says darkly. Ned rises to leave, lightly telling her that ""we have a few centuries before that happens!"" ""Only two,"" Claire says to herself, gazing into the stream. Turning, she sees Dougal gazing at her, unsmiling, and realizes that she has lost whatever small measure of trust that she had managed to acquire from her efforts at healing.

After weeks on the road, watching the same money-gathering routine, Claire's feeling of helplessness grew, knowing she was no closer to Craig na Dun, and may have to reconcile herself to living the rest of her life among strangers. One day, they come upon a family struggling against a band of men as their house is burning, who Murtagh explains is the Watch, a group that extracts fees to protect cattle -- ""or else, they will steal them themselves!"" Claire is disgusted at the extortionist practices, but is surprised when one of their party rides up to the group, talks to them and comes back with a bag of fowl. Claire wonders why they are burning the house, and Murtagh explains that the family is suspected of being British sympathizers. Claire is outraged, and Ned explains that even though the Watch may be criminals, it's considered worse to have British sympathies. As the bag is shown to Dougal, Claire caustically observes that Dougal got his cut, and Ned demures, ""Ah, no, that's just business."" Claire realizes that Jamie is nowhere to be found, and Ned explains that if the Watch caught him, they would turn him in for the price on his head. ""Their loyalty lies where the money lies,"" observes Murtagh matter-of-factly, and their party continues their trip.

At a stop for a meal, the fowl are cooked over a fire, and Claire is offered a portion. She refuses the bird, declaring piously that she has no appetite for stolen food. Angus takes offense, and jumps up to confront her. Heated words are exhanged, and Angus threatens her with his dirk. Jamie tries to deflect the anger, as he cheerfully reminds Angus that it doesn't matter if she doesn't eat, it just leaves more for the rest of them. Angus relents, spitting the ground at Claire's feet contemptuously, and Claire stomps away from the group to settle on a fallen tree. Jamie approaches her, asking what got into her to talk to Angus that way. Angrily, Claire tells him that ""Angus can kiss my British ass!"" Jamie shakes his head a bit at the language, and tries to make her see that her words were ""fighting words"". Claire angrily tells him that ""where she comes from . . ."" but is interrupted by Jamie reminding her that it doesn't matter where she comes from -- she's here. She asks him defiantly if she's just supposed to stand by and watch, but Jamie cautions her that she should not judge things that she doesn't understand, and urges her to stay out of it.

At another village, Dougal is reviewing the subdued villagers' rent payments, and notices that one man, with his hat anxiously crumpled in his hand, isn't paying. The man explains, hesitantly, that the Redcoats had been through two days ago and taken everything. He reminds Dougal that he has always been prompt with his rent, but ""this evening, I can't feed my family."" He gazes anxiously at Dougal, and everyone waits to see what Dougal's decision will be. He thinks for a moment, pats the man on the shoulder reassuringly, and then strides to the wagons, pulling down a bag of food, and hands it to the man, telling him that his family will eat tonight, and later he will join them for a drink. He turns to the villgers and announces that tonight, everyone will eat, and later ""join us for a dram."" As everyone relaxes and begins to gather food, Claire tells Dougal that she knows his motives -- the more he feeds them today, the more money he will collect for himself that evening. Angrily, Dougal advances on her, but Ned jumps up and inserts himself in the argument, warningly telling Dougal that ""the lass can see right through us -- the Scots are not as canny as the British, it's a good thing we aren't doing this in Oxfordshire."" There's an odd note in the warning that Claire is confused by, and though Dougal is obviously irritated by her words, he asks her what she is accusing him of. ""A penny for the laird, a pound for your own pocket,"" she sneers, ""or whatever you want to call it. Dougal takes a deep breath, looks away, and then looks back at her, calmly. ""I call it clan business, and none of yours,"" he tells her, and leaves her standing with Ned, who looks at her with a combination of reproachfulness and ""I told you so.""

In the tavern that even, Claire wearily listened to the same Gaelic speech she had heard dozens of times, and saw the same performance of Jamie's shirt being removed to show his scars. Suddenly, though, she catches a familiar phrase: ""Love live the Stuart!""

In a flashback, she remembers Frank and the Reverend in the Reverend's study explaining the Jacobite rebellions of the early 1700s -- the uprising of 1715, and the most famous one in 1745, with Bonne Prince Charles, a pretender to the British throne who was gathering Scottish sympathizers called Jacobites. Frank is surprised by her questions, and asks what it was that her Uncle Lamb was teacher her in the desert. Smiling, Claire recites that Jacobite comes from the Latin 'Jacobus', which was the Latin for 'James', since they were followers of King James II, the Catholic king who was overthrown by the Protestants. Frank, proud of her command of the history, teasingly calls her a show-off, and as she gazes at an antique early Scottish flag over the fireplace -- blue, with a white cross -- the Reverand goes on to remind her that the Jacobites had devoted themselves to restoring a Catholic king, and that Charles Stuart had used the Highlands to raise money for a Jacobite army . . . ""a lost cause, as it turned out . . .""

Claire, sitting by the fire, suddenly puts all the pieces of Dougal's puzzling behavior together -- it wasn't criminal, it was political. The MacKenzies were raising money for the Stuart uprising. Later that evening, as Claire sits thoughtfully by the campfire, she hears Dougal and Jamie arguing. Silently, she moves to within earshot, and hears Dougal defending the collection of money to Jamie, noting that they are all MacKenzies and are given freely. Jamie, however, is tired of being used as an example, and Dougal challenges him as to his loyalties, since it would seem that Jamie's neck would be safer with a Stuart king. ""My neck is my own concern, and so is my back!"" exclaims Jamie angrily. ""Not while you travel with me, sweet lad,"" Dougal reminds him, leaving him fuming and punching a tree in frustration. Claire carefully asks him if he will continue to allow Dougal to use him, and Jamie admits that he will, saying simply ""he's my uncle,"" and observing that a man has to choose what is worth fighting for.

The next morning, as they are packing up the camp, Claire realizes that she sees them differently -- not as criminals, but as rebels, and wishes that she could tell these proud and passionate men that they are on the losing side of history.

As the party travels, they come upon two bodies strung up on crude crosses -- crucified, with a ""T"" for traitor carved on their bodies -- as a warning from the Redcoats. Dougal orders that the bodies be cut down and given a proper Christian burial. Later that evening, Dougal is passionately decrying the British among the Scots. The crowd is subdued by the executions, but is generous with their donations. Later that night, while in bed, Claire hears a noise outside her door. Curious, she goes to the door and peers out carefuly, and then suddenly trips over a huddle pile by her door -- Jame, curled up asleep at her door. He tells her that the tavern is full of angry Scots and he wanted to make sure they didn't bother her. She thanks him, and invites him to sleep in her room, where it's warmer. He is scandalized, and tells her that it would ruin her reputation. She laughs and reminds him that she sleeps with him and ten other men every night under the stars, but he insists that it's not the same thing at all. She offers him a blanket, at least, to keep warm, and he accepts, assuring her that he will ""be right here,"" outside her door. She goes back to bed, smiling.

The next morning, as she comes down to breakfast, a table of townsmen are glaring at her, and muttering under their breath. She joins her group, and greets Jamie, who quickly greets her and leaves to tend to the horses. As she eats breakfast, the townsmen start chortling and laughing. She sits by Ned and quietly asks him why he let her think they were thieves. ""What makes you think otherwise?"" he asks her, smiling, and she tells him that Dougal's speech convinced her. When Ned is surprised because he didn't think she knew Gaelic, she rolls her eyes and tells him that she has picked up enough to recognize ""Love Live The Stuarts"", at least. Ned warns her that she may know more than she should. She goes on to tell him that the Stuart cause is a futile one, that they can't win against the British army, the best army in the world. ""You talk about it as if the future is already decided,"" he observes, smiling, allowing as he would put the Scots ""fighting hearts"" against the British any day. But Claire is pragmatic, reminding him that fighting hearts stand no chance against a cannon. ""You're going to lose,"" she says, emphatically. ""That's your opinion,"" Ned says mildly. She tries to convince him, but he is undeterred. ""History -- be damned,"" he says confidently. They become aware that the Gaelic conversation of the townsmen have attracted the attention of the MacKenzies. Suddenly, the MacKenzies stand up, and a brawl ensues.

Later, Claire is tending their injuries, fussing over their fighting. ""Any excuse for a fight!"" she fumes, but is taken aback when Murtagh tells her, ""You were the excuse!"" He goes on to tell her that it was her honor they were defending, and that one of the townsmen had called her a whore. Shocked, she looks around at her defenders, who all look down or away, embarrassed. Murtagh explains that she is a guest of The MacKenzie. ""[]We can insult you -- but God help any other man that does!"" he finishes, simply. She stands, abashed.

As they get ready to mount their horses for the morning's ride, Rupert is telling a story about having two girls in bed with him, jealously fighting over which one he will ""swive"" first. The men are listening avidly, with guffaws. ""Can you believe it?!"" he exclams. ""I believe your left hand was jealous of your right -- that's all I believe!"" Claire interjects dryly. After a moment of shocked silence, Rupert breaks out into gales of laughter, and the atmosphere of the party lightens considerably. Jamie, helping Claire with her bridle, says under his breath, with a smile, ""You're the witty one!"" Rupert exclaims that he has never heard the woman make a joke, and Claire tells him that there's a first time for everything, and the rest of the party laugh and relax. Jamie mentions that is going to be a long ride -- three days before they cross Culloden Moor. Claire, startled, remembers her and Frank's visit to Culloden . . .

An engraved stone marks the site of the battle: ""The Battle of Culloden was fought on this moor, 16th April 1746"" Frank and Claire walk the windswept moor, as Frank describes the total devestation of the Jacobite army, all within the space of an hour. He then goes on to descrbe that Culloden was only the beginning of the British devestation of Scotland, and how their rules on no gatherings, no tartans, and the slow dismantling of the clans meant that Culloden was also the beginning of the end for the Highland way of life in Scotland. They stroll by stone markers that commemorate the clans that took part in the uprising -- one of them etched with a simple ""Clan MacKenzie.""

She wonders how many of these men will be alive after Culloden. At a rest stop, Angus unbends enough to carry her packs to the fire, with a friendly smile. She announces that she is going to the river to wash, but no one seems concerned. As she washes, Dougal confronts her, telling her that, for an ""English lady of Oxfordshire"", she seems to have strong political opinions. He observes that she sees things, and if she tells the Redcoats, they'll be hung from crosses just like the men they cut down. She protests that she is not a spy, but he accuses of her sowing the seeds of doubt n their midst,""'working behind the cover of her women's skirts to undermine the Cause."" She tries to tell him that she is just trying to warn him. ""Warn me about what?"" he demands. She thinks, wondering what she can say that will not get her in further trouble, and settles on ""I'm trying to save your life,"" but they are interrupted by the approach of a patrol of Redcoats. One of them greets her: ""It's a pleasure to see you again . . and once more, I'll ask you -- is everything all right?"" Claire, surprised, recognizes the officer as the young British man from the earlier village, and tentatively greets him. He cooly introduces himself as ""Lt. Jeremy Foster, of His Majesty's army,"" and the MacKenzies realize that their camp is surrounded by Redcoats. ""And this time, I do mean to ascertain the lady's wellbeing."" Dougal rises and confront Lt. Foster, telling him that the lady is none of his concern. Uncowed, the Lieutenant asks Dougal who he is, and Dougal proudly tells him ""Dougal MacKenzie, Warchief and brother to Colum, Laird of the MacKenzie clan, and the lands upon which you stand."" Undeterred, Lt. Foster tells him, ""MacKenze or not, if you are holding this English lady against her will, you will be dealt with."" He addresses Claire, and asks her, ""Tell me, madam, are you here by your own choice?""

Dougal turns to stare at her. The lieutenant waits for her to respond. Claire looks back and forth between them, weighing the possible answers . . ."

We are suddenly brought back to 1743 and the priest is pronouncing Claire and Jamie married.

They are given a private room at a tavern upstairs - downstairs, the clan is still celebrating. Jamie comments that they are not likely to go to bed ""until we've made things official."" It is clear that both Jamie and Claire know that they need to have sex for the marriage to be legally recognized, and they are both feeling awkward about it. Jamie tells Claire that she needn't be afraid that he will force himself on her. She asks him why he agreed to marry her. She acknowledges that she did not have a choice, and Jamie admits that he felt that he didn't either. The perspective shifts to Dougal explaining the situation to Jamie - that marriage to Claire is the only way to keep her safe from Randall. Ned explains that the marriage must be consummated right away for it to be legal and that there must be witnesses who were in the building (if not in the room). Jamie is concerned for Claire's feelings, but realizes that it is the only way to protect her from Randall (knowing what he is capable of). Claire is visibly touched by his selflessness. The two nearly kiss, but Claire asks Jamie to tell her about his family. He does so, and the two spend the next several hours getting to know each other better.

They are interrupted by Angus and Rupert who are checking to see if they have slept together yet - obviously not as they are still dressed. Jamie throws them out and he and Claire laugh at the absurdity of the situation. Claire then suggests they go to bed. Jamie helps her undress (to their undergarments) and they kiss passionately. Jamie attempts to make love to her from behind, but Claire, confused, turns him around and they lie on the bed together. They awkwardly make love for about 30 seconds. Claire asks Jamie if it was how he imagined it, and he says, ""Almost,"" then admits that he didn't know that lovemaking was meant to be done face to face. Jamie asks Claire if she liked it, having been told that women generally don't. Claire tells him that she did like it, and her voiceover explores her guilt at enjoying her adultery.

Claire tells Jamie that she is hungry and goes out of the room. Jamie follows her, and the two, clad only in their undergarments, are seen by the clan, who applaud their consummation of the marriage. Claire retreats to the room and Jamie goes to get them some food while warding off lewd comments by his relatives.

Back in the room, Jamie tells Claire that Dougal advised him not to appear too eager to please his bride lest he give her too much power, advice that Jamie immediately disregards, saying that he is happy to be under her power. He speaks in Gaelic, calling her his brown haired lass and romantically describes her beauty.

Claire comments on Jamie's new kilt and the perspective shift to Jamie and Murtagh, who borrowed a Fraser kilt for Jamie, despite the risks of his wearing the tartan of his family. Claire expresses surprise that Dougal allowed all the pomp and circumstance of their wedding, and Jamie explains that he had three conditions to marry Claire.

The first condition is that they be married properly in a church before a priest. The scene shifts to Dougal and Willie attempting to gain the services of the only priest in the village. The priest is unwilling at first, but Dougal eventually convinces him.

The second condition is that Clare have a proper wedding ring. Angus and Rupert go to a blacksmith and ask him to have a wedding ring made. They give him an iron key to use for the ring, explaining that he is to keep the ends of the key intact (the ""blade and bow"") and use the middle part for the ring. Claire asks what the key was for and Jamie doesn't explain.

Jamie's third condition is that Claire have a proper wedding gown. For this, Ned has to visit a brothel where the madame sells him a gown that a lord bought for his wife and used in payment for their ""services."" It was never worn. Ned buys the dress before indulging in the services offered.

Jamie asks what Claire did all day before the wedding and she admits she spent most of it drinking. She remembers removing her gold wedding ring (for Frank) and storing it in her bodice. Jamie remembers every moment of the wedding perfectly. The scene shows them meeting each other in front of the church. Claire protests that she can't marry Jamie because she doesn't know his real name. He tells her it's Fraser. ""James Alexander Malcolm MacKensie Fraser."" The two exchange vows both in English and in Gaelic, and Dougal cuts both of their wrists, which are bound together in a symbol of their union. Their first kiss as man and wife is passionate, and makes Jamie think that Claire doesn't regret marrying him.

Claire asks Jamie to take off his shirt. Even though they have made love, they still have not seen each other naked. They do so, and Claire asks him if he has ever seen a naked women before. He says yes, ""But not one so close... and not one that's mine."" They make love again, much more satisfactorily. Jamie admits that he didn't know that women could enjoy it so much, and Claire tells him that it only happens when the man is a very good lover. She then tells him to keep still and pleasures him in other ways, much to his enjoyment.

Jamie goes to sleep and Claire goes downstairs to find something to drink. The wedding party has dispersed, but she is accosted by Dougal who tells her that he gave the news to Captain Randall. He assures her that Randall won't be bothering her anymore. He makes a move on Claire who rebuffs him, saying that she is Jamie's wife. They are interrupted by Rupert, whom Claire thanks for obtaining the ring. She goes back to the room and Rupert makes a lewd comment about her to Dougal, who punches him in the face.

Jamie wakes up and takes a pearl necklace from a leather bag. He puts it around Claire's neck and tells her that it belonged to his mother and that now it belongs to his wife. He tells her that it is precious to him, ""as are you, Claire."" The two make love for a third time.

The next morning, Jamie dresses and kisses Claire before going to breakfast. Claire picks up her discarded wedding gown, and her gold wedding ring falls out of it. Claire puts it back on her left hand (customary for a 20th century bride) and looks at the iron ring on her right hand (customary for an 18th century bride), and contemplates her two marriages."

He caresses her hand as he asks, curious if what he is feeling is ordinary or something special. Claire gently returns the caress, and admits that the feelings are unusual. As they smile at each other, they are startled by an arrow that lands a few feet away. Both Jamie and Claire throw themselves to the ground, and Jamie crawls over to examine the arrow. Laughing, he straightens and beckons his friend, Hugh Munro, who has spotted them on the cliff, and greets him with a hearty hug.

Hugh joins them, and Jamie proudly introduces Claire, his wife of two days. After Hugh makes an elaborate bow, he offers a celebratory drink and gifts Claire with a piece of amber, in which a dragonfly is embedded. Jamie goes on to explain that Hugh lost his tongue and was badly burned by the Turks in Algiers when he was captured at sea and refused to convert to the ""Musulman religion"". In return, several parishes have given Hugh permission to beg within the borders of their parish, as is evidenced by the gaberlunzes, or small metal tags, hanging about his neck like dog tags. Claire is silent in sympathy, and Jamie breaks the momentary silence by asking Hugh what his news is. In a combination of rough sign language and grunts, Hugh tells Jamie that a man named Horrocks wants to meet Jamie and has information that can prove Jamie is innocent of killing one of the guards. Hugh doesn't think Jamie should trust him, but Jamie is anxious to clear his name and return to his home, Lallybroch, with his bride, his Lady Lallybroch.

At the Reverend's house, Frank is despondent. They have a theory that Claire may have gotten lost returning from Craigh na Dun that day, fell in a river, and been swept twenty miles downstream, but even Frank is skeptical. As the Reverend insists that she could have been swept ashore and could be taking refuge in a cave, surviving on fish and frogs, Frank is unconvinced and recognizes it as a very, very unlikely occurance, but the Reverend insists that's possible, since she's had Army survival training. Mrs. Graham and a small boy, Roger, enter the library with tea and biscuits, and the little boy carefully offers the plate of biscuits to the Reverend, then politely asks if he might have one. Indulgently, the Reverend allows him one, laughing and chasing him, as Frank gazes at newspaper clippings describing Claire's disappearance that the Reverend has tacked to a poster. Frank turns down the offer of tea, and leaves in search of something stronger. In the bar, a woman approaches him and calls him Mr. Randall, and says that he can call her Sally. Sally says that she knows a man that has information on Claire's disappearance.

Around the campfire, the men are telling stories, when suddenly the men become aware of the horses stirring uneasily. Quietly, they signal each other that someone else is near. Jamie whispers to Claire not to look around, and then tells her that when he gives her a signal, she should take a knife and run and hide behind a tree. The group nonchalantly makes stealthy preparations, and suddenly, Jamie shouts to Claire to ""Run!"". The MacKenzies are attacked and fight back in a brief scuffle. Jamie finds Claire safe afterwards, and explains it was another clan, the Grants, who have only taken a horse and a few supplies.

Eagerly, Frank follows Sally to a meeting site, but finds himself attacked by muggers who have lured him there with the intention of robbing him. and demand the reward he has offered for Claire. As an ex-Army officer, he quickly dispatches the muggers, and continues to beat a hapless mugger in frustration until Sally screeches for him to stop. He turns and grabs her by the throat, demanding if there was ever any information on Claire, and she shakes her head. Later, the Reverend gently urges a despairing Frank to leave Inverness and take up the threads of his life. Claire has left him . . . he must now leave Claire. When Frank asks the Reverend if he believes that Claire has run away with a Highlander, the Reverend quotes Sherlock Holmes and observes that ""when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains -- however improbable -- must be the truth.""

The next morning, the MacKenzies are looking for the knife that Claire dropped during the scuffle the evening before. They find it, and Rupert returns it to Claire, who protests that ""it's too long and heavy for me!"" Rupert chuckles and tells her that the ""lasses say that to me all the time,"" which earns a smile, but Ned Gowan points out that it was foolish to give Claire a knife without teaching her how to use it. The MacKenzies agree that she needs a sgian-dubh, a small hidden knife, and a lesson on wielding it follows, as Angus demonstrates the most effective places to stab a man. Claire listens closely.

Frank is packing, preparing to return to Oxford. He sees Clare's suitcase, and opening it, he looks over the neatly folded clothes, and gazes at a small framed picture of Frank and Claire on their wedding day.

Claire and Jamie have found a quiet spot, and are eager to make love. However, in the midst of their lovemaking, they are startled by the unmistakable click of a gun. Frozen, they find themselves captured at gunpoint by two Redcoat deserters. As one of them holds a gun on Jamie, the other prepares to rape Claire. Terrified, she still remembers her knife lessons, and pulling her hidden knife free, she stabs the deserter in the back as he falls on her. The distraction is enough for Jamie to surprise the other deserter, and in short order, both Redcoats are dead, Jamie has scooped Claire up and is dashing away.

As he is taking his leave, Frank overhears an argument between Mrs. Graham and the Reverend. Mrs. Graham is determined that Frank should be made aware of the legends surrounding the circle of stones, but the Reverend doesn't want Frank distressed by these ""fantasies"" of hers and possibly raise false hope. Frank observes mildly that it's an old house, and their conversation carried. Mrs. Graham tells him about the legends of people who travel through the stones, because the circle of stones mark a place on the earth when the powers of the earth are focused, and for ""certain people, on certain days, it allows them to pierce the veil of time."" Mrs. Graham believes that Claire traveled to some other time. Frank asks when -- or where -- that might be, but Mrs. Graham says it depends on the individual, and that the legends say that the travelers often return. Frank reflects for a moment, and then announces that he is returning to Oxford. ""Did you not hear me? They often return!"" insists Mrs. Graham. ""I heard you -- but I do not share your beliefs,"" Frank says, tiredly, and turns to go. As he leaves the bedroom where he has been staying, he gently closes the door -- and leaves Claire's suitcase behind, alone on the bed.

Jamie is distraught with guilt as he holds a shattered Claire, apologizing over and over again for bringng her to that spot without proper guarding. When he notes that her hands are cold, she realizes that she is going into shock. The MacKenzies have heard the shot, and come running to investigate, finding the deserters. Claire desperately tries to rein in her scattered feelings, afraid that if she starts telling Jamie her feelings, she won't be able to keep from telling him the truth about herself. The MacKenzies are grim at the discovery of the bodies, and Dougal declares that ""this is what becomes of a man who forsakes his King and country!"" They are worried about Jamie meeting Horrocks alone, and declare they will accompany him.

Claire is still in shock from the attack, and doesn't remember riding away from the campsite, but as the MacKenzies make their way through the woods, she realizes that she in angry, and doesn't know why. As the men stop, Jamie explains that it may be dangerous meeting Horrocks, and wants Claire to stay behind, safe, with Willy. Claire tells him to just leave her alone and take Willy and bitterly adds, ""I can take care of myself -- I think I've proven that."" Jamie grimaces at the tone in her voice, and mutters, ""But you needn't prove it again."" He promises Claire that he will be back, and she looks at him skeptically, telling him that he shouldn't make promises that he can't keep. He declares that he will return, and extracts a promise from her, in return, that she will stay there. Reluctantly, she promises, and as the men ride away, she suddenly realizes that she's not angry with Jamie or the would-be rapists. Instead, she is angry with herself for forgetting her true purpose -- to return to the stones and to Frank.

Frank's car is racing down the road and he is listening to a radio report on the dealth of George Patton that morning (21 Dec 1945). He passes a sign pointing to the turn to Craigh na Dun, and a few yards down the road, he stops, considering . . . and then reverses to make the turn . . .

Claire and Willy are waiting in the woods, when Willy announces that he needs to take care of some ""personal business."" Claire dismisses him casually, telling him to go ""fifty yards away and downwind."" As Claire idly wanders around the clearning, she tries not to think of the attack. Suddenly, she looks up and sees Craigh na Dun a short distance away -- the place where it all began. She reflects -- she has been Claire Randall, Claire Beauchamp, and Claire Fraser -- and asks herself, ""Who do I want to be?"" She begins running eagerly across the meadow to the stones . . .

Frank climbs the small hill to the stones, wandering around the circle, half-hoping to find Claire returned to him. Sobbing, he cries out, ""Claire . . . where are you!? Claire?!"" . . .

Claire, racing to the stones, hears Frank's voice, and cries out ""Frank! Wait for me!"" Eagerly, she runs up to the large stone, reaching out to the stone and crying Frank's name . . .

Frank hears a faint voice . . . or it could be just the screech of a passing bird . . . but alert, he gazes around. ""Claire . . "" he whispers, and walks away.

. . . distraught, Claire begins screaming as Redcoats ruthlessly appear and drag her away from the large center stone . . .

Bound, she is tossed in a wagon and taken to Fort Willliam. As the wagon jolts along she plans her upcoming encounter with Black Jack Randall. As they sit in his office, he offers her a drink and congratulates her on her marriage. He tells her he doesn't care if she considers herself English or Scots, notes that she is wearing both of her wedding rings, and wonders why Dougal MacKenzie values her so much that he would bring her into his clan to keep her from talking to him (Randall). Claire shrugs, and they toast ""The King."" Randall looks at her speculatively, and then observes that he is glad she still acknowledges herself a subject of the king. Piously, Claire declares that the MacKenzies are all loyal subjects, but Randall snorts in disbelief, convinced that they are devoted Jacobites. He draws up a chair, and tells her that he intends to discover her true nature by any means possible. Calmly, Claire sips her wine. ""Perhaps you should ask the Duke of Sandringham,"" she says significantly, earning a surprised sputtering cough from Randall. Innocently, she looks at Randall, but Randall is disbelieving that Claire, too, is a Sandringham agent. Claire has played a desperate hand, remembering Frank and the Reverend's speculation about Black Jack's secret patron, and based on his violent reaction, she sees that they were correct. As Randall tears off his stained neckcloth, he asks Claire if she knows the Duke. She laughs lightly. ""Really, Captain, must you be so obtuse? Is it not clear by now that you and I are both in the employ of the same great and powerful man?"" Black Jack does not believe her, sure that Sandringham would have told him, but Claire mocks him gently, asking if he really knows all of the Duke's secrets. He threatens to send a message to the Duke, and Claire amiably agrees, noting that either the Duke will be pleased that Randall has ferretted out his agent . . . or very displeased that Randall has upset his carefully laid plans. She casually reties the neckcloth, spinning a tale that the Duke may retaliate against Black Jack, and withdraw his support, and suggests that Black Jack simply let her go and continue her mission, without the Duke discovering how close he has come to disrupting his efforts on behalf of the King. Black Jack corrects her and suggests that she means ""his wife's efforts"", and asks if she has met the Duchess. Claire says she has never had the pleasure, but Randall professes skepticism that one of the Duke's agents doesn't know the Duchess. Claire implies that she is in communication with the Duchess by messenger . . . which causes Randall to withdraw a length of rope from his desk and tells her, with a triumphant smile, that there is no Duchess. Claire realizes that she has been caught in a lie. Tying her up, Randall tells his orderly to stand outside the room and not to respond to any cries that he may hear. Terrified, Claire begins to struggle, but Randall is determined to get the truth out of her. Ripping her bodice open and throwing her face down on the desk, he throws up her skirts in a prelude to rape, but stops to threaten her with his knife, playing the edge of the blade along her breast.

Suddenly, a voice from the window threatens, ""I'll thank you to remove your hands from my wife."" Startled, both Randall and Claire look up to find Jamie perched in the window -- with a gun trained on Randall."

Down below, we see Jamie lying on his stomach on a cot in the prison cell with his hand bloodied and wounded. As the camera pans, Jack Randall is shown laying next to Jamie on his back. He is awakened by the sound of music and rises from the cot, naked, and dresses to join the guard. Jamie hoarsely states that Randall owes him a debt. Randall grabs his dagger and starts toward Jamie but is interrupted by a strange sound. As he goes to investigate, Jamie grunts and groans. In the hallway, Randall hears the sound even louder and it sounds like a stampede. He looks out the window of a door and is subsequently trampled by a stampede of cattle. He has blood emanating from his head and is presumed dead by Murtagh, Angus, and Rufus, who have come to save Jamie. They go to Jamie's cell and find him lying on the ground, having turned himself over while trying to get Randall's attention. He is in pain. Murtagh grabs his kilt from a nearby heap, wraps Jamie's naked body and lifts him over his shoulder to carry him out the back door that Claire left open. Meanwhile, the guard is busy trying to get the cattle under control.

Far down the road, Claire is standing watch and waiting for Jamie's kinsmen to bring him to safety. She sees Rufus driving the wagon and, as he stops, she climbs aboard to assess Jamie's condition. Apparently, Jamie has already been tended as he smells of lavender oil, which is used to relieve pain. As Claire rouses him from his stupor, he mistakes her for Randall and tries to strangle her. She escapes his clutches and Murtagh shouts that it's only Claire. Jamie is in a daze and is distant from reality, having been been put into a trance by both pain and emotional trauma. Rufus races Jamie to a monastery where Willie has made temporary preparations. Fr. Anselm greets her and they bring Jamie inside so Claire can tend his wounds.

Br. Paul tries to give him food but Jamie knocks the food out of his hand. Br. Paul leaves and Claire tries to talk some sense into Jamie but he doesn't want to be touched. Claire asks what Randall did, to which Jamie replies, ""too much and not enough.""

Back in the prison cell, Jamie's hand is still nailed to the table. Randall, having escorted Claire from the prison, has returned and is drinking out of a flask. He offers the flask to Jamie who willingly takes it and tries to drink the remaining contents but is stopped by Randall. Randall offers to make Jamie more comfortable and grabs his dagger. Randall warns Jamie that this will cause pain, as he slowly releases the nail from Jamie's hand. Jamie falls to the floor and vomits. Grabbing a nearby bucket of water, Randall takes Jamie in his embrace in a misguided attempt to comfort him. Randall places drops of water on Jamie's brow and exclaims that Jamie is a ""magnificent creature"" while looking him over. As he clutches Jamie, they look like a perverse version of Michelangelo's ""Pieta."" Randall attempts to kiss Jamie but gets an unwelcome response, especially when he tries to open Jamie's mouth with his tongue. He claims that kissing Jamie is like ""kissing a corpse"" and says he knows he can do better. He threatens to have his men bring Claire back within the hour. Jamie remarks that he said he would not resist but Randall is not happy that he only wants to submit ""like Christ on the cross"" and says he will see about that. Lifting Jamie up, he places him on a stool and spread Jamie's legs. He reaches underneath Jamie's kilt and begins to stroke. He asks Jamie if he likes this before ducking down and attempting to arouse him orally. Jamie, though trying to resist, begins to feel pleasure. Randall notices his hesitance and warns him not to ""play the worm with me"" and states he wants to ""make this a pleasant experience for them both."" He continues to stimulate Jamie with his hand (we see nothing). Jamie exclaims to Randall to do ""take his pleasure and be done with it"" as he spits on Randall's face. Taken aback by this exclamation, Randall asks whether Jamie believes Randall cannot ""control the darkness he inhabits."" Seeing Jamie's terror, he drops Jamie's kilt and bends him over the table, stating he will get a response out of Jamie - one way or another. He proceeds to brutally rape Jamie from behind and tells Jamie to scream.

As Claire begins her work, Br. Paul tries to convince Jamie to take the laudanum that Claire is attempting to administer so he can sleep through the pain. Claire must set 9 bones in his hand and is worried about his well-being. Jamie tells her that Randall made him crawl and beg to the point that Jamie wished for death. Claire states that he is not dead and she will not let him go through life as a cripple. He states he does not care and grabs the vial away from Claire and tries to harm himself rather than take the dosage Claire measured out. She grabs the vial away from him and he falls asleep. Claire sets to work - first, setting the bone sticking out of Jamie's ring finger on his left hand. It is not an easy task and requires considerable force. Claire narrates that the wounds she tended as a nurse in the war were horrific, but none of them were her husband, however, she forgets anything outside of what she is doing and we see her stitch Jamie's hand and splint it. Claire is afraid of infection and paralysis but does the best she can. Br. Paul suggests that Claire get some sleep and he will wake her if anything should happen. As Claire leaves the room, she feels sick and vomits in the hallway.

As the friars are called in from their daily duties, Claire seeks solace in the chapel but is interrupted by Fr. Anselm lighting the candles on the altar for the evening vigil. He apologizes for interrupting her prayer and asks if she would like him to hear her confession. Its been years since Claire has confessed and tells him that it probably won't make sense. Nevertheless, Fr. Anselm beckons her to sit and she opens up about everything - the fact that she has another husband, her travel through time, her marriage to Jamie, etc. Rather than show unbelief, Fr. Anselm claims that Claire's travel through time has been a miracle and, whatever her sins may be, she should trust they will be forgiven. He absolves her and she goes on her way.

The next morning, she goes to see Jamie and asks Br. Paul how he is doing. Jamie is refusing food and drink. As Claire assesses his current condition, she realizes he is running a fever but the wounds are healing nicely. Claire requests that Br. Paul bring her a bucket of the coldest water he can find so she can relieve his fever and plenty of clean cloth. Jamie states that Claire cannot save a man ""who does not want saving.""

Meanwhile, Jamie's kinsmen are conversing amongst themselves. Murtagh is worried that Jamie is refusing food. Willie is worried as well as he states that his uncle, who lost his arm in a tree accident, lost his life in the same manner - by refusing bread and starving himself to death. This upsets Murtagh and he goes to see Jamie. They talk in Gaelic but Murtagh is obviously upset over something Jamie says and and shouts at Jamie.

In another flashback, Jamie crawls on the ground and tries to get away from Randall who is sitting in the corner, amused by Jamie's attempts. Jamie vomits again and tries, unsuccessfully, to get up. Randall goes over to him and stands over Jamie. As he is talking, Jamie hallucinates that Claire, not Randall, is talking and he reaches for her. Randall uses this in an attempt to manipulate Jamie further, asking if Jamie is his. Jamie responds ""you, yes, only you."" Randall grabs his letter signet and heats it in the nearby lamp. He lifts Jamie up and gives him the signet, telling him to put Randall's mark on him. Confused, Jamie does as he is told and cries out in pain.

In the present time, Claire and Jamie's kinsmen are worried about Jamie's well-being (and the Redcoats) and make plans to head to France. They state Jamie has two relatives in Paris - Fraser and McKenzie. Willie also remembers that Claire said she had relatives in France, but she states they were relatives of her late husband and would not be supportive of her marriage to Jamie. She believes Jamie should be with relatives of the Fraser clan and Murtagh makes plans to find ship for passage.

Willie goes to Jamie's bedside, determined to talk some sense into him. Jamie, on the other hand, wants Willie's blade to put him out of ""this black misery."" Horrified, Willie runs away and tells Claire of Jamie's suicidal thoughts. Claire confronts Murtagh (who just got passage on a ship to France) about Jamie's request but Murtagh states that Jamie told him in confidence. Teary-eyed, Claire wonders aloud why Jamie wants to die so badly. Murtagh reminds her that Jamie has been through torture and rape and ""isn't that reason enough?"" Claire disagrees. Murtagh warns her that he will not allow Jamie to die like an animal with his ""foot caught in a trap"" and, if Jamie shows signs of death, he will put Jamie out of his misery. Claire faints in Murtagh's arms. She is roused by Br. Paul who states that Jamie's physical wounds are still healing but his soul is tormented. Murtagh suggests that Claire join Jamie in the darkness in order to bring him to the light.

Later, Claire picks lavender in the monastery garden and makes an oil from the herb. Using the potion, she attempts to wake Jamie and shock him back into reality. Jamie hallucinates that Claire is Randall again and tries to attack her when she rubs the oil on him. Claire defends herself but discovers what Jamie has been hiding - the mark of ""JR"" on his side. He tells her that Randall did not brand him - he did it himself. Reluctantly, he gives up his secret and tells Claire that Randall did not just use force to get what he wanted - he made love to Jamie.

Back in the prison cell, Randall pours the bucket of water over himself and turns to Jamie with a smile. He holds out a bottle of lavender oil and tells Jamie to smell it. He rubs the oil on Jamie's wound and tells Jamie to think of Claire's hands. Using Claire as bait, Randall manipulates Jamie into masturbating. He rubs them both with the lavender oil and proceeds to join Jamie on the cot. Randall removes his hair tie and holds his hair above Jamie's nose. Jamie is still confused and thinks this is Claire's hair. Randall seizes this opportunity and enters Jamie from behind. Randall tells Jamie to call him Claire, which Jamie does. He experiences arousal while Randall makes perverse love to him. Realizing what has just happened, Randall tells Jamie that Claire will never be able to forgive him. Jamie feels incredibly guilty over the shameful incident. Recalling this to Claire, he tells her that it was the first time he wasn't in pain and he couldn't help himself. Claire tells him there is nothing to forgive but Jamie doesn't believe her. He tell her he cannot be her husband any longer and he won't be anything less. Claire states that he did what he promised - to use his body as protection - and what was necessary to survive. Jamie believes Randall broke him and he now belongs solely to Randall because of the brand. He wants Claire to touch him, but at the same time, he wants to ""vomit with shame."" Determined to change his mind, Claire grabs hold of Jamie and tearfully states that she believes Jamie is the only reason for all that has happened and if he wants to die, she will die right there with him. Suddenly realizing that he is causing Claire pain, he reaches for her but pulls away. As she weeps, Jamie wonders how could she love him like the way he is but she says she will ""have him any way she can always."" They embrace, at last.

Later, Claire attempts to give Jamie laudanum but he refuses, stating that he wants to be awake when the brand is cut out of his skin. Murtagh grabs the sterilized knife and quickly inserts it, removing the branded flesh. He holds it in his hand for a few seconds before tossing it into the flames and Jamie spits on it. They watch it burn away.

Jamie's kinsmen say goodbye while Jamie waits for Claire and Murtagh in a small boat. Angus asks Claire if he can kiss her and she agrees, but he takes advantage of the situation by grabbing her forcefully. He then claims he lost his head and apologizes. Rufus takes Claire's hand gently and kisses it and Willie hugs Claire goodbye. Claire and Murtagh then join Jamie on the Cristabel. Claire soon feels ill and Jamie is amused that she is ill, not him. Claire is glad that Jamie is regaining his sense of humor and hopes everything will be alright. Jamie promises it will but they are both headed into an unknown future in France. He also promises that they will return to Scotland. Claire reminds him of the rising, Culloden, and the end of Highland culture but wonders if they can stop it from happening. She also, reluctantly, announces that she is pregnant and is worried about Jamie's reaction since she told him she was unable to bear children. However, he is very happy about the news and embraces her as they head out into open waters to France, full of hope and a fresh start. Murtagh joins them, glad that Claire has brought hope back into Jamie's life."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0553263/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,"When Pam reveals that she is pregnant, the Ewings try in vain to mend fences with Digger Barnes at the family barbecue.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Robert Day'],[''],[],[],[],"Jock (Jim Davis) is organizing the yearly barbecue at SouthFork, the ranch of the Ewings. Robert ""Bobby"" Ewing (Patrick Duffy) thinks it will be a great opportunity for him to bury the hatchet with his arch-enemy, Willard ""Digger"" Barnes (David Wayne); after all, Willard is Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal)'s father. Willard is not happy about the situation either, as he resents Jock for having stolen his fortune. Cliff Barnes, (Ken Kercheval), Pam's brother, wonders why their father is going to the barbecue at all. Willard just wants to make his daughter happy. Cousin Jimmy Barnes (James Canning) will pick them up.

Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray) is organizing the barbecue. She asks Pam to move over her car to let the grocery's van out. Lucy (Charlene Tilton) is interested in knowing young sweet nineteen cousing Jimmy. Pam agrees but she just enters the manor house. Pam phones his doctor and she learns that she is pregnant from Bobby. She is overjoyed about it. Bobby is having a shower while she starts looking at her body and touching her belly.

Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly), the ranchhand who used to shag Lucy all the time, takes Maureen (Jo McDonnell) to the barbecue. Jimmy is one of the first to congratulate Pam on her pregnancy.

One of the new party-goers is J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman)'s new secretary, cute brunette Susan (Lisa Lemole). Lucy makes her worried with a sarcastic reply when Susan admits that it was J.R. who hired her. That leaves Susan wondering.

Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes) is the first to spot Willard Barnes arriving to the party. She at least tries to be civil to him. Sam (Haskel Craver) and Tilly (Irma P. Hall) are there to serve the drinks. Sam tells Bobby that he should tell the good news to Jock and Miss Ellie soon, as everybody is talking to it. Ray and Maureen dance in front of Lucy, who is a bit jealous and makes small conversation with them by telling them about Bobby and Pam's news.

Tilly and Sam bet on who's gonna be first to start a fight when they learn the news. They also mention an old love affaire Miss Ellie and Willard had when they were young and single. Willard is getting drunk by the minute. Miss Ellie is telling Willard that all the family loves the ranch, and that she has not got a single regret because Jock and her love each other so much.

Lucy tells Sue Ellen the good news. She goes to tell Pam how excited she is. Sue Ellen drinks two square cups of wine, and she tells J.R. Sue Ellen knows that Jock is crazy about having a grandson. She blames her childless state on J.R.'s disinterest in making love to her. Lucy tries to start a conversation with Jimmy, only interested in eating. Jimmy looks really dumb.

Sue Ellen drinks and drinks. She talks to a table of elderly ladies about her conjugal problems. She daydreams about her past, when she was Miss Texas. As a present for the baby, Pam and Miss Ellie force Jock and Digger to shake hands; albeit coldly, this is done. ---But five minutes afterwards, Digger is accusing Jock of stealing the oil company and now of stealing his daughter and grandson. Digger gets drunk, although Pam tries to take him home.

Digger makes a spectacle out of himself. Jock mocks him. Digger sings and dances to a popular Texan tune. Bobby also argues with Jock. J.R. is also tipsy, and he sits down to drink some more with Digger. Pam finds Jimmy and Lucy frolicking, as she usually does with all the boys. Pam tells Jimmy to take her father home.

Sue Ellen rides a horse drunk. J.R. insults her some more, also drunk. Bobby punches J.R. when he insults Ray Krebbs and the fact that he was an ex-boyfriend of Pam. Sue Ellen prevents Bobby to go on beating on drunk weak J.R., and she asks him to take her far away from there. Back to the barbecue, J.R. notices Pam still on the haystack. He goes up and talks to her. Pam wants to leave. Pam falls to the floor and loses the baby.

Afterwards, Jock, Miss Ellie and Bobby are distraught. J.R. is still drunk and says that he never meant to hurt Pam. Bobby asks why he went to the stable. Jock has to remind Bobby that J.R. is his brother. Bobby wants to leave South Fork as soon as Pam can walk. Jock says that it'll be a mistake, and that he wants to keep his family together.

Finally, it's Pam who wants to stay living in the ranch.

Sue Ellen asks J.R about the event. He is as cold as a fish with her."

A giant many-legged monster with sharp tentacles bursts out of the water, thrashing with a large white-haired armored man. They fight ferociously, the man's eyes are blackened with magic, and he chops off one of the arms of the monster; black oily fluid sprays everywhere, and he stabs the monster, finally killing it. The man looks sympathetically at the mortally wounded animal by the lake, speaking to it quietly of fate.

In a small village he enters a pub, his horse tied up outside with the monster under a blanket, and he asks directions to the Alderman's house. The barman threatens him - a Witcher - to leave the bar or be killed. A patron comes along and threatens him as well, then his henchmen join in a bully bunch. A woman shuts them all down, promising the Witcher *her* men will improve their manners before the market on the morrow. They apologize to her, naming her Renfri. Renfri demands of the barman he give the Witcher beer, but the Witcher declines breakfast - he's full of venison.

Renfri asks the Witcher why is he there, he tells her of his fight with the monster and now he wants to be paid for killing it; she makes sardonic comments his need for new clothing. A girl comes in from the alley, interrupting them, she wants to know how much the warrior wants for the kikimora, the monster on the back of his horse. He leaves the bar with the girl, she tells him a tale of how she killed a rat, and leads him not to the Alderman (it seems the Witcher killed the wrong kind of monster), but to the wizard Irion, he'll probably buy the kikimora. The girl - Marilka - tells him - Geralt of Rivia - another tale how she killed a dog she sold to Irion for 15 crowns. She gabs about monsters, asking Geralt what he has fought, what is his experience. She also makes comments about his clothing - she used her 15 crowns to buy a new dress. They approach Irion's doorway, and the Witcher enters a peaceful and colorful garden full of naked maidens, whilst leaving a delighted Marilka to guard his horse, Roach. Stregobor, the wizard who has lived in the tower 200 years under the alias Irion, tries to employ the Witcher to kill Renfri, he says she is a demon, one of 60 women who will destroy the world.

In a large city, a group of boys play Knucklebones in the square. The Queen's horsemen approach and the boys scatter, leaving behind Princess Cirilla, dressed as boy, and the guards tell her she must return. She joins King Eist and Queen Calanthe as Calanthe grants benediction to her knights; the princess and her Grandfather, Eist, banter behind the Queen, who is trying hard to keep a straight face while continuing the ceremony.

In the tower, Stregobor tells the Witcher Renfri was born under an eclipse, he delivered her himself. As she grew, she did ""shocking"" things, and he tried to have her killed when she was a teenager. Now Renfri has found Stregobor, but the Witcher is unimpressed, Geralt leaves the tower without making a promise either way to Stregobor, but he is clearly not interested in killing the beautiful Refri.

In the castle the royal family enjoys a party, happy guests dance to lively music: Eist and Calanthe bicker about Nilfgaard, a possible invading force. The Princess listens surreptitiously, but when she asks questions, the Queen tries to brush it off, she believes the Princess is too young, but Eist disagrees. The Queen tells her granddaughter it is not possible to predict the future, she should always be prepared: then she is interrupted by a nobleman approaching with his son, Martin, asking the Princess to dance. Cirilla joins the festivities while the King tells his Queen how happy he is to be married to her... and then the Queen learns that Nilfgaard has invaded.

Renfri approaches Geralt by a stream, telling him Stregobor is a monster, and tries to employ Geralt to help her kill him. She tells him Stregobor sent a thug to have her killed, the man raped her, and Renfri killed him with her mother's broach. She continues was forced to become an outlaw, to fight, to steal, she says the men she employs saved her. Geralt tells Renfri she does have a choice, though she says she does not, but Geralt insists: she has to choice to move on with her life, leaving Stregobor behind in her wake.

A giant battle rages on the hills outside Cintra; the King and Queen, both experienced warriors, join the fray. Princess Cirilla sulks in the castle with the wizard Mousesack and her guard, Lazlo, who declares he is honored to protect her. Mousesack tells Cirilla a tale of wizards killing young princesses, which sounds like the tale Stregobor told Geralt, but Cirilla is dismissive of his attempts to quell her. In battle, King Eist is killed and Queen Calanthe wails, throwing herself wildly into the clash after his loss.

In the castle, Cirilla wanders the halls, encountering guests trapped inside by the invasion, and she hears the commotion as her grandmother is returned, fatally wounded. Calanthe tries to comfort her granddaughter, but tells her everything, Eist is dead, and their subjects will be killed horribly by Nilfgaard; she asks the guard, Danek, about the guests from the party; she tells him to check if there are enough supplies, and he leaves the room. Calanthe reminds a terrified Cirilla she will one day rule Cintra. Mousesack opens the window of Calanthe's bedchamber and casts a spell to repel the Nilfgaard forces: he tells Cirilla he will hold it as long as he can.

Geralt has a conversation with Roach about the first monster he killed - a horrible man who tried to rape a young girl. Renfri listens from behind a tree. She tells Geralt she has decided he was right, she should leave. Gently, she reaches out to him, and they make love.

The battle rages as Mousesack's defenses fail and Nilfgaard breaches the gates. Calanthe whispers to Mousesack, ""He is in the gate keep,"" and Mousesack looks hopeful as he leaves. Calanthe tells Danek, ""It's time."" Danek leaves again. Calanthe labors to speak with Cirilla about another lesson in being a good ruler, but also describes the horrors of war. Mousesack returns and tells Calanthe ""he"" is gone, and Calanthe tells Cirilla to remember good leaders always choose mercy. Then she orders Lazlo and Mousesack to take Cirilla. Cirilla throws a shrieking fit, and Mousesack and Calanthe look askance as a bedside table laden with dishes rattles following her outburst. Mousesack and Lazlo cautiously dress Cirilla in her cloak, and Calanthe tells Cirilla, ""Find Geralt of Rivia, he is your destiny."" Lazlo leads her away. Mousesack and Calanthe part somberly. While the battle rages outside, Danek distributes small corked bottles of poison to all the guests still in their rooms as Mousesack hastens to follow the Princess and her escort. Rather than face the atrocities Nilfgaard will invite upon them, the guests have been given the poison so they can commit suicide, which they do.

Calanthe pushes herself up from her bed and walks to the window, using the last of her strength to observe Cintra being destroyed. Lifeless, her body falls to the ground.

Lazlo and Mousesack find horses outside, but they are sighted by Nilfgaard forces. Mousesack orders Lazlo to run with Cirilla, remaining to defend them to the last. While galloping away, Cirilla demands of Lazlo he tell her what's going on, but Lazlo is killed with an arrow in the throat before he can answer. They fall off the horse, Ciri tries to escape but is nabbed by the bowman with the feather in his hat who killed Lazlo.

Geralt dreams of his night with Renfri. He hears her voice as she tells him he will be stoned by people in the market. Geralt awakens, realizing Renfri is going to market, not leaving as she said she would until she kills Stregobor. Geralt meets her men in the market, they tell her Renfri is going to find Marilka, and her men attack, but Geralt butchers them all. Marilka screams, Renfri has captured her, Geralt tries to reason with her, but Renfri tells him his magic is useless, only silver will work on her - silver works on monsters, and she is one, created just as Geralt was created. They fight, Renfri is highly skilled, but Geralt matches her. He tries to spare her, but her final attack leaves him without a choice, and he kills her. As she dies, she tells him, ""The girl in the woods will be with you always, she is your destiny.""

Racing away over the hills, Cirilla shrieks as she did in the castle, and the bowman and his horse fall, Ciri escapes him with her screams which cause a rock formation to fall and it opens a wide chasm between them.

Stregobor finds a bloodied Renfri in the market, and calls out to Marilka to bring a cart so he can autopsy her, ""proving"" she is a demon as he has done with other women in the past. Geralt threatens him, and Stregobor enchants the people in the market, calling Geralt a butcher for killing Renfri and her men. People begin to throw stones, and Marilka sadly warns Geralt to leave. Geralt takes Renfri's broach before he walks away.

Ciri runs into the woods."

She is disdainful, tossing it aside, but lets him kiss her, anyway. She glances back and asks where is her daisy, it's not where she threw it, a humpbacked girl has picked it up. The couple torments the young girl, tossing her to the ground, but she suddenly finds herself in a cave, alone except for a young man who tells her she ""portalled"" into the cave, the Tower of the Gull, Aretuza. He suddenly declares her a virgin and she slaps him reflexively. He tells her she has performed magic; he digs in a bag for a flower, and eats a piece of a petal to create a new portal so she can escape. He warns her someone will be searching for her; she asks his name, Istredd, but runs before he can learn hers. Back on the farm she carries food to the pigs. The farmer is abusive, tossing her to the ground, splashing her with slop. A finely dressed woman arrives on a buggy and asks about buying a pig. The man says they're ten marks. She glances at the girl and asks how much for her? She offers him four marks. Her mother protests, the woman is a witch, but the man says she's not his daughter, he accepts the four marks, the child is sold. The girl glares at the witch, refusing to go with her.

The girl is locked in a room somewhere far away; screaming to be released, she breaks the mirror on the wall, and cries softly she was sold for less than a pig. She breaks the mirror, and stares at the shards...

Cirilla hides from Nilfgaard troops searching for her in the snowy woods. She blackens her hair with mud, and continues to elude them. Finding a bush with berries, she tries to pluck some to eat, but is stopped by a young boy who signals the berries are poisonous. He beckons her to his hiding place where he's trapping rats to eat. Ciri refuses at first, but his fire is warm and the rats are food. She asks the boy who he is, where he comes from, but he is silent. She tells him her troubles. Walking in the woods with him, Ciri realizes his hands are cold, and she offers him one of her gloves which he takes with a look of wonder. They find a camp of Cintrans, and she runs toward them, but the boy disappears.

In a Posada pub, Jasker the Bard sings a bawdy song to the patrons. They heckle him, but he takes it in stride, then he notices Geralt sitting in the corner, silent. He teases the Witcher, but Geralt has no interest in banter. Jasker recognizes Geralt; a patron overhears their conversation, offers to hire Geralt to rid him of ""a devil"" stealing grain. The man pays him, and Geralt goes in search, trailing Jasker who is annoying him: Jasker is determined to follow, he thinks learning of Geralt's experiences and adventures will help him write creative music and he offers to help Geralt fix his reputation.

In Aretuza, Rectoress Tissaia DeVries sits by Yennefer's bedside. She calls her Piglet, and orders her to the greenhouse, where Yennefer attends her first lesson in Chaos and spell casting. All the girls are potential witches. One wants to go home, but the Rectoress tells her she's in a new home. The lectures the girls on lifting a rock on each of their desks. There is also a flower, but it is not explained, but all the girls are to practice. Fringilla lifts the rock as instructed, but her hand begins to shrivel, to her horror. The Rectoress congratulates the hysterical girl, explaining the flower should have powered her attempt to lift the rock, and she demonstrates: the Rectoress uses the flower, it withers, she do not. ""Sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die."" All the girls lift their flowers and begin lifting their rocks, but Yennefer is unable; the Rectoress is sympathetic, she's weakened by her suicide attempt.

Wandering down into the Tower of the Gull, Yennefer introduces herself to Istredd.

Cirilla enters the camp, observing the people who have escaped Nilfgaard in an aloof manner. She sees a soup cauldron and tries to serve herself food, but is pushed out of the way by a woman who has been waiting in line. The woman curses the Queen, shocking Ciri, then a young man approaches her, saying his late father made the fine cloak she wears. He explains his brother died in the elf uprising and now he kills elves and cuts off their ears and wears them on his belt. He takes her to his tent and introduces her to his mother; she, too, curses the Queen. She offers Ciri - who has introduced herself as Fiona - a fresh pair of shoes, and the dwarf servant, Abbott, brings her a pair: when Ciri hesitates, the woman tells her, ""Don't worry, he's one of the clean ones.""

Jasker continues to follow Geralt, trying to convince the Witcher he will be useful. He tells Geralt the place they're traveling is Dol Blathana, given to humans by the elves before they ""retreated into their Golden Palaces."" Geralt hunts for the Devil, while Jasker continues to chatter nervously. An iron ball is thrown at them, and Jasker excitedly tries to look at the Devil, but he's knocked out with another iron ball. The Devil is Torque, the Sylvan, he says humans filled food they left out for him with iron balls in an attempt to make him sick. Geralt warns Torque he cannot remain where he is, and Torque tells Geralt he can't remain either, then someone knocks the Witcher out from behind.

Tissaia quietly lectures the girls in reading minds, they're partnered up and are expected to find out one another's ""greatest fear"". The class quietly continues into the night, and Yennefer speaks up, her partner Annika's greatest fear is snakes. Tissaia calls Yennefer forward, criticizes her inability to perform tasks menial or magical, then disdains now Yennefer has the temerity to lie? She scoffs that the Piglet's fear she will never be loved is likely correct.

In the cave, Yennefer complains to Istredd, and he tells her his thought transference lesson took him three days. Yennefer is irritated, good for him, but she can't do anything. He offers to help her read his mind. She refuses, but then stares at him, sees the moon jellyfish in the water, hears the sound of cicadas, tastes and smells warm bread. She asks are these things Istredd loves, and he replies these are things he thought she would love. She smiles tremulously, recognizing his feelings.

Lying down in the tent, Ciri lies awake, the mother of the family who has taken her in reassures her she will take care of her. Ciri says she's looking for Geralt of Rivia, and the woman asks, is he a knight? Ciri does not know. She explains her parents died when she was a baby, and her grandmother died in the Nilfgaard attack. The woman is sympathetic; Ciri is also sympathetic, her remorse is real, she had never known this sort of thing before, she had always been protected.

Thunder crashes and Tissaia opens Yennefer's door, telling her to get up. The girls follow Tissaia into the Tower of the Gull, standing beneath an opening to the sky: they're going to capture lightning in a bottle. Doralis is first, but she is knocked out by the lightning strike. Annika captures the lightning, but she can't control it, and it explodes in her face. Yennefer is knocked aside by the next strike. Sabrina captures it, she is the first to hold it without incident. Angered by her error, Yennefer tries to hit Tissaia with another lightning strike, but Tissaia deflects it. As they exit the cave, Tissaia stops Yennefer, what she did was foolish, and dangerous, and she has to consider that others have different strengths, Sabrina controls her emotions, but Yennefer, like Tissaia, is consumed by her emotions. This admission surprises Yennefer. Tissaia tells her she cannot succumb to weakness, and muses does Yennefer actually has what it takes to Ascend?

Jasker and Geralt are tied up in a mountain cave. An elven woman abuses them. Jasker rails at her about the elven palaces and the woman scoffs, do they like her palace? Geralt head butts her, and she coughs uncontrollably. Jasker asks what is the problem, and Torque explains she is ill. Jasker asks Filavandril about why they left Dol Blathana, and Filavandril asks Jasker if he really believes anyone would voluntarily leave their home and starve in the wilderness? He rebukes the woman, Teruvial, she wasn't supposed to hurt anyone, but she is non-plussed, what does it matter if two humans die? Geralt corrects her, he's not human; he says to let Jasker go. Filavandril says he has no choice but to kill them, he says Chaos was even polluted so humans could use it against them. Geralt says Chaos is as it always was, Filavandril is simply choosing to starve. Filavandril says the humans called the massacre of the elves, ""The Great Cleansing,"" and explains to the Witcher he does not want to kill, but he feels cornered. Geralt says they can leave, stop trying to live where they are, rebuild their people, prove they're more than humans say they are. Teruvial offers there are elves who will gladly fight, and Filavandril unsheathes his knife, but Torque defends the Witcher. Geralt offers his throat if that's what Filavandril really wants.

Yennefer approaches Istredd in the cave, Tissaia is going to send her away, she knows about them. Istredd cannot share the magic he has learned to make the portal, it's not the same magic they are taught, and Yennefer cries that he still does not love her enough. He shows her the skulls all over the cave, they're elf skulls from centuries ago, he tells her elves built Aretuza before humans invaded the continent. He tells her after the Conjunction of the Spheres, elves taught humans magic, but then humans killed them and took over. He says he knows the truth, and wants to honor the elves, not lie about them. Gently embracing Yennefer, he shows her a flower like the one he used the first time they met, Yennefer eats a small piece as he did, and he tells her the elven incantation. Speaking it, she opens a portal, and Istredd is stunned, it's huge and how did she learn to do it so fast? Yennefer tells him her real father - not the farmer who married her mother - was half-elf. He was killed in The Great Cleansing. Yennefer has grown up believing she is hunchbacked because she is cursed by her elven blood, and this is also why no one could ever love her. Istredd kisses her.

Yennefer sits in the Rectoress' office, she has brought the flower Istredd gave her, Tissaia says she just wanted to see if Yennefer could keep control of her emotions and get the flower from the boy. Yennefer asks if she can Ascend, and Tissaia says, ""Listen for the knock."" In another office, Stregobor says to Istredd he's been working on her for months, what has he learned from Yennefer? And Istredd reluctantly admits he has learned she is part elf.

Nilfgaard has found the Cintran camp and attacks. The mother tells Abbott to find her sons, and then hands him a big bag of possessions which he drops. She calls him stupid, and he takes a knife and kills her which Cirilla backs up against the wall of the tent. She is pulled through the tent wall by the boy who joined her before and they run.

Yennefer sits in her room, she hears Tissaia knock on Annika and Doralis' doors. Yennefer follows them and another girl to a grotto deep in the bottom of the Tower of the Gull, and as Tissaia enchants the girls, Yennefer watches her turn the girls into eels. Tissaia orders Yennefer to push them into the pool. Yennefer realizes the girls still have power to generate for Aretuza. ""Sometimes the best thing a flower can do is die,"" says Tissaia.

Jasker admires his new lute - given to him by Filavandril - while he walks with Geralt, amazed that Filavandril just let them go. He starts singing a song he promises will change public opinion of Geralt.

Ciri and the boy drink water from a stream, and Ciri sees he has taken off his hat - he's an elf! He introduces himself as Dara, while Cirilla tells him honestly she is Ciri.

Jasker continues his tune, and Geralt realizes he's changing facts of their meeting with Filavandril; he berates Jasker for being disrespectful, but Jasker replies, ""Respect doesn't make history."" Geralt groans as he rides on without the Bard.

Yennefer pushes the eels into the pool and smiles at Tissaia, who smiles in return."

At a brutal cost, Yennefer forges a magical new future.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Alex Garcia Lopez'],"['', '', '']",[],"['body double in sex scene', 'female rear nudity', 'female nudity', 'king']",[],"A pained young voice talks of a monster which comes out on a full moon. The young man speaking is mortally wounded, mauled by the monster he describes to the Witcher, a wolf who crosses a maiden's grave who dies before her baby is born, the baby continues to grow and becomes a monster. The Witcher is a black-haired and grizzled warrior, another Witcher; he demands a high price to find the Vukadluk, the beast which hunts on the full moon. The young man dies, his father inconsolable by his bedside.

The black-haired Witcher follows a blood trail into the village butcher shop, hunting his quarry. He unsheathes his sword, but too late - he's taken by surprise...

Geralt lies sweaty and thirsty after three days with a prostitute. She explores his scars, singing Jasker's songs as she recognizes each one. Geralt isn't greatly responsive to her attempts to draw him into conversation. Frustrated by his lack of interest, she talks of another Witcher who just last month stopped with her on his way to Temeria. Geralt is now alert, what was the other Witcher's reason for going? She says the other man took the miners' coin, then ran instead of taking care of their ""pest problem"". Her pimp interrupts, demanding Geralt pay up or leave, Geralt leaves Roach with the man after getting directions to Temeria.

The miners assemble to talk about their problem. The grieving father talks about Nilfgaard, ""The Usurper"" rallied the people to take back their country, and he suggests the Temerians do the same. Geralt is listening, he scoffs: they can't kill the monster, so they'll kill the King? He offers to help for 1/3 of the price his compatriot demanded, and only after he does the job will he exact payment. Fatalistically, he offers he will die if he cannot kill the Vukadluk, so they won't lose money this time.

King Foltest's troops arrive to break up the miners' meeting. They try to rally, but then they submit. The leader, Lord Ostrit, orders Geralt to leave. At the border the guards following Geralt pass out, and a sorceress, Triss Merigold, steps out of the shadows. Geralt is dubious, she's employed by King Foltest, they exile Geralt, but then try to enlist him into saving the beast, not kill it? Triss explains she thinks the beast is not a Vukadluk, and she asks Geralt to help. In her examination room where she has the victims (including the Witcher whom no one knows was killed), Geralt confirms the baby is a Striga, a child born after Princess Ada was cursed: the curse turned her daughter into the monster ravaging the countryside. Geralt is resigned, it's another princess he may have to kill.

In the Tower of the Gull, Yennefer and Istredd make love before an audience of mages. Istredd is disturbed by the illusion Yennefer has created, especially when she makes them applaud Istredd's orgasm. He ponders how many more times they'll be able to be together this before they Ascend. Yennefer teases Istredd about being a ""dashing explorer"", and he returns the favor: her appointment will be at the court of Aedirn and King Virfuril is supposed to be a very handsome man. Yennefer suggests maybe she'll be able, as King's Mage, to convince Virfuril to let Istredd explore Aedirn's ruins. Then she broods: all the other girls are so certain what they want for their enchantments. Istredd tries to encourage her, but she is derisive, HE does not have to change anything about himself, meanwhile the girls' enchantments are cosmetic. Istredd asks, ""What do you want?"" She responds she wants to return to Aedirn and never be who she was again.

In the studio, the Mage Giltine tells Yennefer he'll turn her into a ""Living Work of Art"". She is delighted by the fancy dresses and all the baubles he shows her. She selects a dress, and Tissaia enters - she dismisses Giltine and tells Yennefer she sees only her flaws, but she amends: everyone sees only their own flaws. Mages, however, are flawless, free, no longer victims of their own weakness. She helps Yennefer see herself as the strong and stunning woman she is.

Lord Ostrit berates Triss in the King's chambers while his Majesty eats distractedly. Triss defends Geralt, Lord Segelin, another member of the Guard, reminds Triss they've been calling the Striga the daughter of Ada, that makes her a Princess. He and Ostrit trade words, and Geralt suggests Ada's lover may have been the one to curse her and subsequently her child. This further incenses Segelin, and in the escalating argument, Foltest interrupts, dismissing everyone from his presence. They file out, but at the last moment Geralt pushes the door shut behind the others and bolts it. Foltest is sanguine, he is a King, he's unimpressed, but Geralt pushes, he's mentioned Princess Ada was murdered, but now that there's a question of her baby's father... why has the King never married? Why is he allowing this revolt to even occur? Who is the Striga's father? Foltest does not respond, instead he tries to get a rise out of Geralt.

Ostrit and Segelin finally break in, but the king merely banishes Geralt.

Tissaia meets with the other council leaders at Aretuza to discuss the political situation in the surrounding kingdoms around the Continent. They talk of King Dagored of Cintra, who may be dying, and his young daughter Calanthe, who by all accounts is even more stubborn - and mistrusting of mages - than her father. They speak of Nilfgaard, where Fringilla will go and help calm the situation. Stregobor has little faith in Fringilla, he suggests Yennefer should go, not Fringilla, but Tissaia reminds the council they had already appointed Yennefer to Aedirn. Stregobor brings up her part elf ancestry, saying it will be an insult to other nobles who are offended at the thought of elven blood. Learning of Yennefer's blood line, the others start to yield to Stregobor - Tissaia finds herself overruled by Stregobor's machinations.

Yennefer fantasizes in front of a mirror. Giltine brings her a new dress, a red one from King Fergus of Nilfgaard. Yennefer barges into Tissaia's office, demanding an audience with the council. She derides Tissaia's lack of power, but Tissaia is blunt, the council knows Yennefer is part elf. Yennefer feels betrayed, but Tissaia tells her it was not she who told them, it was Stregobor, ""divine the rest.""

Geralt sits outside an abandoned palace, watching the guards on the ramparts. Triss finds and confronts him, why hasn't Geralt left, she's sure he has a purpose in still being there, she'll help. Together they frighten the guards off and walk through the crumbling building. Passing a painting of Foltest and Ada as children, Geralt tells Triss he believes Foltest to be the father of Ada's daughter. They locate Ada's bedroom, Triss asks Geralt if Foltest is the one who cursed Ada? Geralt is unsure. He smells something in the girl's bed. Triss digs through an old music box and finds a compartment with letters from Queen Sancia to her daughter, demanding she get rid of her baby. They show the letters to Ostrit who is shocked to learn the Queen may have cursed her daughter! Ostrit is distraught that Ada, who confided in him, didn't tell him any of this. He wonders if Foltest actually raped his sister; but Geralt thinks there's something more to Ostrit, he recognizes the scent of Ostrit from Ada's sheets, old smells and new - Ostrit is having sexual fantasies about a dead girl decades after her death. Ostrit becomes outraged, he admits he hates Foltest, he wants the people to revolt and destroy the King. Geralt knocks him out.

Sabrina Ascends, making her pledge to Aretuza. Istredd telepathically asks the others where is Yennefer? Fringilla asks if he hadn't heard? After the ceremony, Istredd finds Yennefer in the cave writing a letter she will make her ""father"" sign declaring she is his REAL daughter. She and Istredd argue, she knows he betrayed her, he offers he will take her away with him, but she's disdainful, she never wanted a life picking up the dust behind him. Istredd is devastated to realize Yennefer never cared as deeply for him as he does for her. His parting shot to her is that she's lost her chance to be beautiful, but Yennefer retorts she wanted to be *powerful*.

The graduates dance at a party following their Ascension. Queen Sancia scolds her young children, Foltest and Ada, for not being properly respectful to Rectoress DeVries, who compliments the queen on the wonderful pair. Tissaia approaches King Virfuril who is less than impressed by Fringilla: he complains she's not a graceful dancer. Yennefer blasts into Giltine's studio, challenging him to prove he's an Artist. He tries to refuse, he needs to prepare the herbs, she refuses them, she says she can stay awake, she doesn't need to be anesthetized.

At night, Geralt crosses the bridge to the abandoned palace, and is met by the guards - led by Foltest who asks if the Witcher will be able to save his daughter? Geralt gives Foltest Renfri's broach, he asks Foltest to give it to his daughter if he perishes, Foltest realizes Geralt is willing to die trying to save his cursed child. Geralt admits to Foltest he had to kill Renfri. Foltest admits to Geralt he had an affair with his sister. He leaves with his guards, and Geralt enters Ada's bedchamber - where Foltest has apparently tied up Lord Ostrit. Geralt demands Ostrit tell him how to lift the curse. Ostrit is defiant, but eventually tells the Witcher he found a witch in the woods, she sold him a lamb, he had to recite a chant and then bathe in the lamb's blood until sunrise. He can't fully remember the chant, but he realizes Geralt will have to fight the Striga until sunrise to lift the curse. Geralt leaves Ostrit tied up, and drinks a potion from his saddle bags.

Yennefer is strapped in, stripped and ready for Giltane to perform his enchantments. She tells him not to change her eyes or remove her suicide scars on her wrists. He tells her the price for her enchantment: she will never have children. She agrees.

The Striga exits Ada's sarcophagus, and Geralt abandons Ostrit in the chamber where the Striga finds him and kills him. She goes on the hunt for Geralt... and he hunts for her. He drops a long silver rope, and he lassos her with it, but she's able to break free, much to his consternation...

Giltane operates on Yennefer, removing her uterus and ovaries as she begins to groan in building agony, while Geralt and the Striga battle: as they struggle, Geralt breaks the floor from beneath them to gain a little momentum...

Giltane removes Yennefer's now-cooked organs from a pot on the fire, grinding them up to make a potion, while the Striga continues her search for Geralt, while he has found the room with the sarcophagus and enchants a doorway...

Giltane recites a spell in elder while he paints the potion on Yennefer's spine and around the deformity on her face, while Geralt waits in the sarcophagus' chamber for the Striga to return...

Giltane intensifies his recitation while the Striga jumps Geralt from behind and they clash spectacularly...

Giltane repeats the elder chant, Yennefer begins to respond to the pain of her metamorphoses, and the Striga throws Geralt against a column...

Yennefer screams in mounting pain, struggling against her bonds. Geralt gains the upper hand as Yennefer breaks the bindings, and Giltane tries to lend her comfort as her agony increases: her body glows everywhere Giltane has painted her with the enchanted potion...

Geralt throws the Striga across the chamber while Giltane holds Yennefer, but in her anguish she throws him off and falls to the floor...

Geralt is thrown across the chamber while Yennefer's body re-forms itself...

The sun is rising, and the Striga, unable to kill Geralt, tries to escape the dawn into the sarcophagus. Geralt throws her aside, climbs in himself, sealing it shut so the Striga cannot gain entrance, while Yennefer howls in excruciating pain...

The rooster crows, the chamber is silent, and Geralt opens the sarcophagus. Groaning, he sees the princess transformed into a human, naked, wet with mud and detritus from her chamber, he checks to see if she's alive, and discovers she isn't totally transformed back quite yet: she attacks him, biting his throat, and he retaliates, tearing at her as well. Wounded, they stare at one another, she is animalistic only because she knows nothing else, but she remains human...

The graduates continue their celebration at Aretuza, and a fully transformed Yennefer enters, she is truly stunning, straight-backed, her face is flawless, she approaches King Virfuril, introduces herself as one of his subjects, and he tosses Fringilla aside despite Tissaia's attempts to intervene on her behalf. Fringilla is heartbroken as the King leads Yennefer to the dance floor - and then tries to fondle her.

Triss tends Geralt's wounds while he whispers Renfri 's name feverishly.

Yennefer tries to protect her charges.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Alex Garcia Lopez'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Ciri continues her sojourn into the woods, hearing the voice calling her name. She sees a glow before her, her trance fades, and she's surrounded by women warriors. The leader tells the others to watch her, she looks Ciri over and tells the others to kill her if she tries to escape. Ciri asks where Dara is, and a tall and commanding woman approaches. Ciri introduces herself as Fiona, again.

In a tavern, a man recounts the tale of how the Witcher was killed by a giant Selkimore which consumed a whole village. But Jasker, at a nearby table, and over the man's protestations says Geralt isn't dead, he's more interested in the details. Again the man protests that the Witcher is dead, then Geralt enters: he stinks, he wants his money, and Jasker sings his song, ""Toss a Coin to Your Witcher."" Jasker tells Geralt because he's made him famous, the Witcher owes him a favor. He invites Geralt to a party with wine, women, and food, and Geralt is distrustful, how many of the nobles at the party want to kill Jasker? Jasker admits he does not know how many, he offers the Lioness of Cintra (Calanthe) will be glad to have him there. Geralt relents and bathes. Jasker tries to talk with the Witcher about his future, but Geralt is adamant, he wants no one in his life. Then he realizes - Jasker has sent his clothes away for cleaning. To the Witcher's disgust, the Bard dresses him in fancy clothes.

At the party, Jasker wants Geralt to blend in, but Mousesack recognizes him immediately - they're old friends, apparently. Mousesack is happy to see him, but is confused by his clothing. Nobles try to toast Mousesack, and he confides to Geralt he's been advising the Skellig court for years - they're all apparently there for Princess Pavetta's betrothal to whomever can plead his case to Queen Calanthe. Mousesack confides the young Prince of Skellig has the inside track: Eist has proposed to Calanthe numerous times since her husband Roegner died, she keeps refusing but she seems to enjoy his attention, Mousesack believes the young man will help strengthen the bond between Skellig and Cintra. Geralt sees Jasker being accosted by a nobleman who thinks he recognizes the Bard, Geralt intervenes, convincing the man Jasker actually is a eunuch. Geralt tries to leave, but Calanthe arrives, covered in blood from a skirmish. Eist is amused, and Calanthe demands the suitors make their proposals, she's bored already. Pavetta is resolute, her mother's behavior seems to disgust her. Calanthe alludes that Crack an Craite, from Skellig, is the front-runner.

In the forest, Ciri is questioned, how did she come to be in Brokilon forest, where was she headed? The leader tells Ciri she is Queen of the dryads, there were many forests like Brokilon before, now only Brokilon exists. Dara cries out in pain as an arrow is pulled from his arm. As they cleanse his wound, the Queen explains the waters of Brokilon will not only heal wounds, but making a stranger drink it will prove if they have ill-intent: it will kill them when they drink it. As she speaks, it's obvious: she does not trust Ciri's tale (or her name), and she asks if Ciri and Dara will drink?

Crack an Craite fights with another young nobleman about manticores they claim to have defeated. Calanthe calls upon Geralt to declare the veracity of their tales, but Jasker hints silently to Geralt to not start a fight. Calanthe is amused, she asks Geralt to recount the tale of how he defeated Filavandril, as the song says, and Geralt denies the story for the facts: he had his ass kicked. But he didn't shit his pants, and suggests perhaps that's what everyone should hope for, ""... a shitless death... But I doubt it."" Calanthe loves his response and invites him to sit at the Queen's table.

Dara asks Ciri why she lied about her name? Ciri tells Dara she's a princess, something she hadn't yet told him. Dara is dismayed, he tells her Calanthe killed his family, but Ciri says it's not possible, she says she wouldn't do it. Dara remembers it all too well, he remembers hiding beneath the dead. He says he would like to forget all of it.

Calanthe complains about wearing a dress, she'd rather be wearing armor. She tells Geralt she's glad he's there, but he says he's not there to be anyone's bodyguard. Calanthe tries to push the envelope with him, but Geralt continues he won't be bought. Lord Peregrine of Nilfgaard approaches for his turn to propose to Pavetta, but the Cintran court overall is derisive. Calanthe insults Peregrine until he retreats. Another man approaches, while Pavetta is mournful.

Queen Kalis holds her new daughter as she rides in her carriage with Yennefer. She complains she is nothing more than a womb to the King - which produces daughters, not sons. She hands Yennefer the baby, and tries to entice Yennefer to stay and keep her company, but Yennefer says she must return. Kalis takes back the baby, and invites Yennefer to speak freely. Yennefer has been with the court for three decades, and expresses disgust with her role, cleaning up stupid messes created by the crown she serves. Kalis says HER plight is worse, she makes a salient point that Yennefer is respected for who she is, not for what she can give anyone. The horses whine, the carriage stops abruptly, and wicked knives penetrate the walls; peering outside, Yennefer watches the guards be slaughtered. Only one is left, and he is staring at the assassin who chases them with a horrid beast at his side. Yennefer makes a portal and the four of them escape to a vast desert. Kalis is shocked when Yennefer explains the assassin was there to kill Kalis, she's run out of chances to produce a male heir. The assassin finds them, kills the guard, and Yennefer opens another portal to a rainy alleyway. Yennefer throws away Kalis' jewelry, something she is wearing can be tracked, and the assassin appears again. Opening another portal to another wilderness, Yennefer says they're still being tracked, and Kalis throws her hair ornaments and everything else she can find, but after they've escaped once more, she tries to lay blame on Yennefer for not predicting this. When the assassin appears again, Yennefer, irate at the accusations, leaves Kalis and the baby behind.

Jasker sings a bawdy song at the betrothal feast, while Calanthe bemoans male tradition. She and Geralt trade good-natured barbs, and Calanthe asks why there are so few Witchers? Geralt tells her it's no longer possible to create more of them since the sacking of Kaer Morhen. Geralt asks why Calanthe continues to fight on the battlefield, and she tells him there's a simplicity in killing ""monsters"". Eist tells Crack an Craite it is his turn to make his entreaty, but a commotion in the back brings Lord Urcheon of Erlenwald who asks for Pavetta's hand. Calanthe is unmoved, Erlenwald is a backwater hamlet, and Urcheon has no glory to his name, and why is he hiding his face? He responds that he has taken an oath not to remove his helmet before midnight. Eist will have none of it, he knocks Urcheon's helmet off and reveals the knight has the face of a hedgehog! Calanthe tries to get Geralt to kill him, but Geralt says the knight has been cursed, he refuses and as some guests attack, Urcheon beats them back and yells at Calanthe he was promised Pavetta by The Law of Surprise. He is attacked again, and Geralt now moves to defend him. Calanthe demands everyone try to kill Urcheon, then Eist lends his support - Law of Surprise has been called, it must be honored. Calanthe joins, but she, too, appears to be defending Urcheon until she tells everyone to STOP.

Kalis pleads with the assassin, she can have a boy, she offers the killer her daughter as sacrifice. The assassin throws a knife and slits her throat, releasing his beast to kill the baby, but Yennefer has returned and she kills the beast. Opening another portal, she escapes to a beach, but not before the assassin throws another knife at her back - and when she looks, the baby was killed by the blade which passed through her body.

Pavetta embraces Lord Urcheon, calling him Duny, and her mother is stunned, what is going on? Urcheon surrenders to Calanthe, he was cursed as a child, but one day he saved King Roegner's life. He claimed the Law of Surprise by tradition, as the Law could mean anything - something that would be a surprise when he returned home. As it happened, his surprise was Calanthe's pregnancy. Then Calanthe reveals she knew of Roegner's ""stupid"" bargain, but Eist defends Urcheon. Urcheon continues his story: never meant to collect, but fate intervened, he found Pavetta by chance, and when it was after midnight she saw him, they fell in love, they made love, and in the morning, she awoke beside the cursed man, his hedgehog appearance returned. Eist tells Calanthe there is no rhyme or reason to the Law of Surprise, it could have been anything a litter of puppies or a bumper crop, but destiny made it: Pavetta. He tells Calanthe she must accept Urcheon's claim. When Mousesack joins in, Calanthe is infuriated by all the men around her who will not fight destiny. Pavetta declares she loves Urcheon, she will marry him, she has decided. Calanthe, defeated, hands her sword to Eist, accepting him, finally. She approaches Urcheon, but instead of embracing him, she tries to stab him. Pavetta shrieks, blasting her mother and all the court aside, and she and Urcheon embrace while a tornado rages around them. Geralt and Mousesack join their magic together to stop the wind, and Pavetta realizes what she is doing will kill everyone. She stops, and Eist asks Calanthe if she finally believes in Destiny? Calanthe approaches her daughter, admitting she had thought her Mother's gift had skipped Pavetta as it had skipped her, Calanthe. She declares her daughter has made her choice. Eist threatens the company that if anyone objects to the marriage of Pavetta and Urcheon, they'll be fighting him and Skellig - because Calanthe has accepted his proposal. Calanthe proclaims there will be TWO vows tonight!

Ciri hears the echoing cry of Pavetta and sees the invading force of Nilfgaard. Gasping, she awakens from her nightmare. Dara has been drinking the waters of Brokilon, he is calm, and Ciri takes the gourd from the Dryad Queen - but the water has no effect, for good or ill. The Queen tells Ciri she needs to drink the water from Shankayan, the source.

On the beach Yennefer watches a hawk lazily circling, and she speaks a eulogy for the dead infant, including her cynical view of the world. Finally, she buries the baby in the sand.

Calanthe wraps her sash around the hands of Pavetta and Duny, binding them in marriage. When the ceremony ends, Duny coughs and transforms back into a human - but it is not yet midnight? Mousesack says it's probably Calanthe's blessing of the marriage has fulfilled Duny's destiny. Jasker is thrilled, and Geralt starts to leave, but Duny demands Geralt must take something, anything. Geralt says he's fine, he wants nothing, but Duny insists, so Geralt says he'll take the Law of Surprise, and Calanthe flips out, NO! Geralt says he's not worried about getting a litter of pups or a new crop, and then Pavetta vomits: she's pregnant. Everyone stares at the Witcher, who then truly turns to leave. Mousesack follows Geralt and tries to get the Witcher to remain, but he refuses, he doesn't want any part of Destiny. Geralt warns Mousesack to be careful.

The Nilfgaard army ransacks Cintra, and Calanthe's body is found by one of the mages led by Fringilla. He cuts a piece of Calanthe's skin from her arm and chews on it. As he dies, Fringilla tears open his guts, and searching them tells the man in the feathered helmet Ciri is in Brokilon forest. One of his men offers up they can spare 10-12 thousand men to take Brokilon, but the helmeted man shuts him up, Brokilon cannot be defeated that way. They leave, dragging Mousesack by a chain, and he falls on Calanthe's body. He retrieves her sash, hiding it in his coat before letting himself be yanked away.

The Dryad Queen cuts into a tree and tells Ciri she must drink from the source. Cupping her hands, Ciri collects some of the mythical water and she awakens in a desert at night, and hears the tree, Shankayan, call to her."

He's dressed superbly in expensive but understated clothing, and carries a long knife and something in a cloth bag. Unwrapping it, he takes out an odd piece of skin - possibly a knee? - and using the knife soaks in in a jar of viscous liquid, puts on the lid and places it delicately on a tier of shelves holding other preserving jars of body parts. He admires them, then disrobes, examining his flawless body in a mirror. He fails at first to notice his visitor who hides in the shadows, then says aloud, ""Love surprises. Love visitors. A surprise visitor even more."" His visitor is the bowman in the feathered helmet, and he holds up a piece of silver which makes the young man recoil. The bowman tells him he knows he is a Doppler, he can become anyone he wishes, but unlike other Dopplers who are kind and ""become"" others for any number of reasons - to comfort someone grieving, or to play roles - this Doppler apparently is not benevolent: and the bowman wants to exploit that. He offers a bag of coins (not silver) to the monster to commit an assassination, but the Doppler laments he had planned to use this body for awhile. Still, he agrees.

A large prison cart stops in the dark and Mousesack is dragged out. He vomits, and Fringilla admires the cell of demiritium - which neutralizes magic - where the wizard has been confined. Mousesack knows she came from Aretuza, he is dismayed by her even as he tries to make sense of what she's been doing with Nilfgaard. She tells him, ""The White Flame has given her a higher purpose"". The bowman approaches, he has the Doppler who is disappointed he has to become Mousesack. The bowman releases Mousesack, telling him to run, and Mousesack, disbelieving, starts to take off, but he's chased by an excited Doppler who apparently enjoys the hunt. His eyes and face change, and as the approaching bowman watches, he becomes the physical image of Mousesack all the way down to his clothing. He tells Mousesack it's not just his appearance: he knows everything Mousesack has ever known, ever felt, ever debated, even just that morning when the wizard contemplated suicide. Slowly, enjoying the sight of what he does, he lazily and deliberately stabs Mousesack, thrilled by the man dying in inescapable horror. With his last dying breath, Mousesack tells both Doppler and bowman they don't know what Ciri is, but the bowman is unfazed, he says, ""She will end up where she belongs,"" and he apparently believes her fate is to be with him. As the monster takes Calanthe's sash from Mousesack's coat, the bowman warns the Doppler to bring Ciri back alive; the Doppler is annoyed, ""Children are our favorite,"" but he agrees.

A man counts Yennefer's coin: she's been undergoing his ""treatments"", but his rates have increased, he wants her to pay more. He muses upon their chosen lives, he's also a mage who has left the service of Aretuza, he tells Yennefer they're very much alike, and offers to go into business with her, but she is wholly uninterested. He reflects on the town where they're both currently in residence is somewhat lawless, if she can drum up business, maybe she can make up the difference in his fees.

Yennefer posts a bill outside her door, ""Correctives quite effective, whatever your objective,"" and quickly gathers a long line of chattering customers anticipating her help. A couple describe their problem (the man cannot get an erection), but Yennefer puffs a magical smoke in his face, immediately correcting his problem. Yen holds out her hand for the fee they readily pay, but they are interrupted by the Mayor, Beau Berrant, and his guardsman: it's not that anyone objects to her charging a fee, he just wants his cut. Yennefer offers to be taken away in chains rather than pay up.

In Brokilon, the warrior general argues in Elder with her Queen, Ciri deceived everyone, they don't know her intent, but the Queen is defensive of the princess, she hopes to guide her. They are interrupted by a scout who has brought the heads of two Nilfgaard soldiers. The Queen says perhaps Ciri is there to help them overcome the potential invading force. Speaking in the common tongue, the Queen says Ciri will be allowed to remain. The general assents and leaves to patrol. Ciri observes that she doesn't seem to be welcome, but the Queen says the general only wishes to protect Brokilon. She tells Ciri Destiny is a two-edged sword: the girl can make a choice, stay or go, but it is time for her to decide.

Jasker sings dejectedly as he wanders by a remote forest pond and encounters Geralt. It's been awhile (several months if not a year or more) since they saw one another, he says he had heard Geralt was in town, and asks the Witcher playfully if he's been following him? Geralt seems to be fishing, and Jasker starts naming fish, what kind is Geralt after? Annoyed, the Witcher tells him he can't sleep, and he's searching for a djinn who should be in the pond. Jasker is thrilled, now, a real djinn? But he also thinks perhaps Geralt is having problems sleeping because he feels the weight of his Destiny tied up with the Law of Surprise. Geralt declines the notion, but Jasker bickers with him until the Witcher hauls in his net, taking out an amphora with a wizard's seal. Jasker wrestles with him for possession, Geralt pulls off the stopper, and the Bard starts eagerly making wishes. The djinn makes some form of aggressive move, and Geralt pitches a spell at it, Jasker is saying it's weird the Witcher is going to such extremes just to take a nap, and Geralt yells at him, ""I just want some damned peace!"" Jasker tosses the vessel to the ground, shattering it, Geralt moves to pick up the pieces, slicing his arm on one of the shards, then he realizes Jasker is gasping for breath and spitting up blood, possibly attacked by the recently freed djinn.

Geralt gallops Roach into a campsite with Jasker hanging on behind him, seeking a healer, and he's directed to Chiraeden, the elf. The elf is amazed, he says it's like a fairy tale, a djinn in a bottle, but warns the Witcher he can only hold the spell Jasker has endured at bay, he is not a magician, he suggests Geralt find someone more skilled, and soon, because Jasker may die. Geralt asks if this town, Rinde, has a mage and Chiraeden reluctantly admits he was employed by the Mayor to bring the local mage to justice, but was unable to do so. Chiraeden says the Mayor has captured the mage himself. Geralt growls why didn't the healer say that in the first place?

Yennefer carefully paints her lips red while Tissaia comments on Yen's life. She tells her protege King Virfuril of Aedirn has died and Demavend rules, now. She tells her Fringilla has thrived in Nilfgaard and Yennefer demands, WHY is Tissaia there? As Yennefer continues to dress in her seductive clothing, Tissaia tells her when she abandoned her post, they let her go, but now she's getting sloppy, trying to find a cure. She warns the younger woman she's going to become as irrelevant as the magicians she's trying to enlist into helping her. And WHY does Yennefer want a baby? She knew the cost of enchantment, why is she trying to reverse it now? She tries to get her to return to Aretuza, offers she'll be forgiven, she tries to take hold of Yennefer, but the younger sorceress pushes her away and tells her to leave. Tissaia steps through a portal.

Geralt races Jasker to the Mayor Beau Berrant's house in the dark and is met by the guard who helped arrest Yennefer: now he is demanding money from the Witcher for entry. Geralt knocks him out and carries Jasker in through a torchlit hallway until he reaches the kitchen where he finds the Mayor naked and under the influence of *something*, seeking apple juice for ""her"". Sitting on a bench, the Mayor falls asleep, and Geralt carries Jasker on one side and the apple juice in the other and goes through a door... into an orgy. Jennifer sits, dozing and oblivious to the naked people around her. At first she hopes Geralt is there for the party but she realizes he's unaffected by the enchantment. When he puts Jasker down amidst the revelers and offers Yennefer the apple juice. She observes his heartbeat is slow, he's apparently a mutant, then she recognizes him as The Famous White Wolf she's heard about, and she asks what kind of magic can a Witcher do? Geralt asks her to please help him with his friend, and if she does, he'll answer any questions, do anything she wants ""all night"" if that's her desire. He tells Yennefer Jasker was attacked by the djinn. After pondering for a moment, she calls out, ""Ragamuffin!"" and everyone in the room is now awake and astonished to find themselves there.

Yennefer emerges from a room and says Jasker will recover, now it's time for Geralt to bathe and she deposits new clothes for him on a table. While he soaks in a hot tub, Yennefer asks why Geralt was fishing for a djinn? She stares at his scars and then undresses, prosaically telling the Witcher to turn his head aside. She sits back to back with him in the tub and flirts obliquely while questioning him about his life as a Witcher. He replies in kind, commenting on her suicide scars and asks about her enchantment. Geralt tells Yennefer once he pays for her services, he'll be on his way, but she says his company has proven to be payment enough, which makes him that much more mistrustful. Dressed in the clothes she provided, Geralt looks in on Jasker, then notices the wizard's symbol from the seal on the floor of the bedchamber - Yennefer is trying to call the djinn! The Witcher tries to take the Bard, tells her the djinn is gone, but she wants to know how many wishes Jasker made before he was attacked, and Geralt realizes he can smell lilac and gooseberries - she's been trying to distract him all along, and now... Geralt is finally well and truly trapped by her.

He awakens in a jail cell with Chiraeden who tells him Yennefer had the Witcher enact revenge on the apothecary and the local pawn broker on her behalf. Both are on the village council and are meeting to discuss Geralt's possible execution. Chiraeden is there because he tried to stop Geralt. After some talk, Geralt realizes the healer is in love with Yennefer, and Chiraeden expresses his opinion Geralt may be as well. The Mayor's guard enters, gleeful at the opportunity to persecute Geralt.

In the Mayor's bedchamber, Jasker awakens to see a naked Yennefer at the end of the bed drawing an amphora on her belly. Yennefer terrifies Jasker.

As the guard beats Geralt, he asks what does the Witcher want, Geralt yells, ""I want you to burst, you son of a whore!"" and the guard's head explodes. A second cut on the Witcher's arm appears, and Chiraeden and Geralt stare at one another - GERALT has been the djinn's master all along!

Tossing him around the bedchamber, Yennefer demands of Jasker he make his third wish, which he screams out he would like to leave the house! As Jasker runs, Yennefer works to capture the djinn into the abdominal prison she's decorated herself with.

Jasker emerges from the house to find Geralt looking for him. After a few words, Geralt heads into the house to save Yennefer, although Jasker and Chiraeden try to convince him otherwise. Geralt finds Yennefer in the bedchamber fighting the djinn, and Geralt tells her HE has the wishes. Yennefer screams at him to make his wish, and he says he'll make the wish FOR her, but release the djinn before it kills her! She screams she doesn't want him to make a wish for her, she wants him to make a wish for himself and then let her take control. Outside the Mayor races away from his house, while inside Geralt makes a silent wish, a third cut appears on his arm, the wizard's seal disintegrates, and the roof of the house collapses.

Outside Chiraeden asks Jasker if he's sure they were inside? And inside, Yennefer has opened a portal into the hall where she held the orgy. Yennefer comes to, and starts arguing with Geralt. Impassioned, they both give in. Outside, Jasker says he'll sing more songs of Geralt, telling Chiraeden how Geralt was his best friend, and the elf is wandering around the house - and he sees the Witcher and the Sorceress inside. Beckoning Jasker, they watch for a few moments before Chiraeden drags the Bard away. When they're finished, Geralt nods off to sleep, finally.

In Brokilon, ""Mousesack"" arrives looking for Cirilla. The general brings him in, Ciri is thrilled to see her friend, she takes leave of the Queen, then leaves with the Doppler, taking a reluctant Dara along."

One man is impatient and suggests to the other it's time to make off with Roach and the saddlebags. An older man with two women warriors arrives, telling the two men they need to stop trying to steal the Witcher's possessions. One of the women breaks the neck of one of the thieves. Geralt tosses the head of the beast he has just killed down the hillside, and tells the other man to drop his saddlebags. Borch Three Jack Daws introduces himself and his companions, Tea and Vea. He takes them to a tavern and feeds the Witcher and the Bard. He wants them to join him in a dragon hunt - one just terrorized a nearby kingdom and the one who succeeds in hunting it down will be granted a vassal state as reward. There are four teams, The Reavers, a group of Dwarves, Borch's team, and a fourth: Yennefer and the Noble Sir Eyck of Denesle. Her entry in the contest convinces Geralt to join, but makes Jasker nervous and afraid.

Geralt introduces himself to the Dwarf leader, Yarpen Zigrin, at the sunrise start of the hunt. Yennefer speaks to Geralt for the first time, and trades barbs with Jasker. It's been awhile, she and Geralt are unchanged, but Jasker is showing marks of age. Eyck, her escort, starts blathering on about Kingdom and Glory. Geralt ties up Roach next to the other teams' mounts and the company sets off on foot.

Ciri and Dara walk to the border of Brokilon forest with Mousesack, and she asks him questions about the Law of Surprise, Mousesack tells her Geralt saved her father, but it's obvious the Doppler is losing patience with her.

Jasker walks with Tea and Vea, trying to determine their relationship with Borch; Tea tells a confounded Jasker Borch ""is the most beautiful"". Behind Yennefer and Eyck, Borch observes Geralt is in love with Yennefer. As they climb, they come to the place the dragon first attacked the kingdom, Geralt doesn't understand why the dragon attacked? Borch says their species is dwindling, they're becoming desperate. Jasker tries to find berries or something to eat in the surrounding woods, he finds some kind of animal and calls out to Geralt, then becomes horrified when it stands up on hind legs. Geralt calls it a hirrika, fairly benign and probably just starving but Eyck steps in and butchers the creature, crying out his victory, and Geralt is disgusted, it wasn't necessary to kill it, they could have just fed it and it would have gone away.

Eyck barbecues the hirrika, but Borch demurs, it's probably not a healthy choice to eat. Boholt approaches their fire and leers at Yennefer. Eyck, sickened by the rancid meat, excuses himself, while the others discuss the local political situation between Nilfgaard and the surrounding kingdoms. Geralt and the others educate Jasker on dragons, green, red, and black, and Borch says there are also gold dragons, which Geralt thinks are a myth. Borch, Tea, Vea, and Jasker laugh about Eyck.

In the snowy forest outside Brokilon, the Doppler is leading Ciri and Dara, while Dara asks questions. ""Mousesack"" spins a tale that Geralt sent him in search of Ciri, while Ciri talks to Dara about his questioning Mousesack. Dara reminds her the Dryad Queen told them to ""ask the right questions,"" and he tells Ciri his mind is clear, now. ""Mousesack"" takes Calanthe's sash from his coat, distracting Ciri from listening to Dara any further.

Yennefer emerges from her tent, seeking Sir Eyck who has disappeared in the night. Yarpen has found the knight down a ridge, his throat slit while he was trying to unburden himself of hirrika - now Yennefer hunts solo. The company walk together, and Tea says this hunt is becoming more dangerous, the Dwarf leader agrees. He tells them the dwarves mined these mountains, they know of a short cut which could cut half a day from the journey ahead, and the others make a pact to go along. As they head in the new direction, Geralt excuses himself to talk with Yennefer. He asks her if she killed Eyck, and she tells him the Reavers did it. Geralt asks why she is hunting the dragon, she says there are healing properties to it, and Geralt is disbelieving, is she trying for another made-up fertility cure? He talks to her seriously, there's a reason she, other mages, and Witchers, as well, are sterile: they cannot raise children whey they live the lives they do. Yennefer rails at him, and as their argument escalates, he lets slip that he has a Child of Surprise, which further infuriates the Sorceress. Trying to calm the situation, Geralt says the dwarves have a shortcut, he asks her to come along, and she relents.

Cirilla asks ""Mousesack"" if he misses Skellig, and the Doppler says yes, of course; Ciri reminisces about Skellig and ice-skating, and she catches the imposter in his lie. Dara attacks him with a knife which turns out to be silver, and as he and Ciri join in beating the monster, the Doppler changes back into its natural form. They nearly overpower it, but then it knocks Dara out and Ciri runs.

As rocks tumble down the cavern, Yarpen laughs about skree and wind before bringing the others out to a small wooden ledge the dwarves have precariously set up on the cliff. He goads Jasker and the others to follow. Borch, Tea and Vea take up the rear, and they trudge along until a plank breaks under Borch: the three of them hang to the chains, but Borch tells Geralt he has to let them go; the older man and his companions fall out of sight. On the other side of the cliff, they set up camp, Geralt staring blindly into the distance. Jasker tries to cheer him up, but the Witcher is not receptive. He goes to Yennefer's tent, it's small outside, but spacious inside, warm and inviting, and he and Yen talk about their relationship which has been going on for some time, brief encounters which always end abruptly as they move on with their lives. At first Geralt rebuffs her, and they have a deep but oblique conversation about their relationship before they make love. Afterward, Yennefer asks him if Witchers really do not feel anything? They discuss who they are, what they could have been, what they want to be. Geralt asks Yennefer if she always wanted to be a mother? She says she always dreamed of being important to someone. As he falls asleep, Geralt tells Yennefer before he met her, his life was empty, but now... she's important to him.

In the morning (probably the first time they've ever spent an entire night), they argue again about the cure Yennefer thinks the dragon can offer, but after realizing the dwarves have left, the two go after them.

Running alone, Ciri is captured by a Nilfgaard scout. She awakens in a kitchen with the feather-helmeted bowman, he tries to give her a drink of water, but she refuses while he tells her how the White Flame has brought them together. Her manner alerts him - he was holding a silver cup, and he realizes ""she"" may be the Doppler, and sure enough it transforms into his duplicate! The Doppler is outraged, he was not told ""what she is,"" and they fight ferociously, matching move for move, as the Doppler points out he knows all the same tricks, he can't beat himself! He taunts, ""Do you really believe all this nonsense in your head? This prophecy? We think you're insane!"" As they struggle the Doppler gains the upper hand and runs from the bakery, followed by the desperate bowman with a sword in his hand frightening the people in the store front.

Yennefer catches up with the dwarves on the trail and freezes them in place, racing up the hill toward the dragon's lair ahead of them. Entering the cave, she finds the dragon already dead, clutching an egg. Tea and Vea appear, surprising Yennefer, and then Geralt catches up, asking how they are still alive. From overhead a golden dragon appears and speaks: they realize it's Borch, he's been in disguise. Tea and Vea tell them the green dragon had been injured, she cried out to Villentretenmerth, but by the time they arrived, she was dead, the egg could not be moved, it was the reason the dragon attacked. Realizing she was protecting her baby, Yennefer lowers her knife. Tea continues after they found her, they heard about the king's hunt, so the trio searched for Geralt, the white haired Witcher, the knight who had been raised not to kill arbitrarily. The Reavers arrive and go on the offensive, but the quartet fight cohesively. When Geralt is overwhelmed, Yennefer casts a spell linking her power with his, and they chase the Reavers out of the cave, slicing them all into ribbons. While Yennefer draws swords with the worst of the fighters, Geralt clashes with Boholt, and one last man left behind in the cave tries to steal the egg, but Borch sets him aflame. Boholt gains the upper hand by throwing dirt in Geralt's face, but Yennefer comes to his rescue, viciously slitting the Reaver's throat.

Jasker wakes up, alone in the campsite. He follows everyone's trail up the mountain, passes the dwarves who are slowly moving as they break the spell, and finds Geralt and Yennefer before being frightened by the arrival of Tea and Vea. The dwarves arrive, too, annoyed they missed all the excitement, and Borch, in his disguise once more, tells the dwarves to take dragon teeth to the king as proof the beast is dead. The dwarves are satisfied.

Ciri is tied with Calanthe's sash to a tree, and Daras free her. She tries to get him to run with her, but he's angered, he wanted remain in Brokilon. They argue, he tells her she's just like her grandmother, leaving terror and death in her wake. Ciri tries to defend herself and then decides she's tired of apologizing. They part company.

Borch talks with Yennefer and Geralt about raising the new dragonet alone, his ""final first"" in this life. He thanks Yennefer for staying to help, he knows why Geralt is afraid of losing her, and Yennefer inquires what does he mean? Geralt admits his third wish in Rinde was something about her, and she becomes enraged, their love isn't real, it's just a wish he made. He yells at her at her behavior just so she can have a baby, and she points out he has a Child of Surprise. Borch interrupts them both: he tells Yennefer she will never have a child, and Geralt will lose her, and she leaves in a huff, Geralt watching dolefully as she goes. Borch reminds him of his Destiny, too, before parting. Jasker tries to step in a little too soon, and Geralt nearly bites his head off. Jasker makes a dejected departure, leaving his friend alone, again.

In the bakery, Fringilla tells the bowman, Cahir, he didn't have to kill everyone, he could have simply used silver to find the Doppler. She cleans his wounds while he pouts, and talks of his leading Nilfgaard, she is even more fanatic about his role as King of Nilfgaard than he is. Cahir tells her to gather the army again, it's time for them to keep moving forward."

The man who runs it startles her when he asks her where she's heading. Nervously she tells him she's going to Skellig. She asks how far to the coast, he tells her it will take a week on a horse, but she's on foot. A woman overhears, she warns Ciri to be careful, it's not safe.

Geralt overlooks the Nilfgaard troops heading to Cintra, he contacts Mousesack in the capital, the wizard is aghast, the Witcher been gone so long they thought he was dead. Geralt wants to know the child is fine, he's surprised to learn Ciri is a girl, that Pavetta and Duny are long dead. He warns Mousesack he saw the army at the Amell Pass. Mousesack says since the night of the betrothal feast, Calanthe has fortified Cintra, but Geralt hears soldiers' footsteps, he realizes Calanthe heard he was there, she's sent assassins - the Witcher grabs Mousesack, using him as a shield; when they're attacked, the wizard opens a portal for them to escape.

Danek wanders the forge with Calanthe, inspecting weapons, and they talk of Eist's return. She tells her soldiers she wants reports from the Amell Pass, but then she sees Geralt and Mousesack - Geralt tells the Queen he was planning to stay away until she sent assassins. Calanthe is irate, she'll pay him whatever he wants, just leave! He tells her the Law of Surprise cannot be bought off, Mousesack echoes him. Calanthe laments Ciri is all she has left of Pavetta, and Geralt reassures her Ciri's survival means Pavetta lives on. Cornered, the Queen declares the Law of Surprise has been called.

In the market a Punch and Judy show makes children laugh at the mockery of Cintra's fall. Ciri approaches a stall and buys new gloves with a silver ring in her pouch. The woman who saw her earlier offers her a room at her farm, she'll finish her shopping and take Ciri with her on the horses she has tied up. Ciri swipes one of the animals and takes off.

Geralt walks toward the royal chambers and hears Calanthe telling her granddaughter it is her Destiny to go with Geralt. The girl - who is NOT Cirilla - looks apprehensively at Geralt. She asks Calanthe (dressed for the knights' benediction) if she can say goodbye to her friends and Calanthe assents, then the Queen sends the Witcher away, she'll summon him when it's time for them to go. Mousesack stands by silently, and Geralt continues down the hall, hears a door echoing and a predilection sends him out to the square where Ciri plays knucklebones with her friends. The stand-in princess bows to Cirilla, calling her Highness, and the Witcher knows he was lied to. He confronts Calanthe as she's heading for the ceremony, and she defiantly refuses to send Ciri with him. She tells Eist to escort him away. Geralt reminds Eist he had honored the Law of Surprise, and argues it's dangerous for everyone if he leaves without the Princess. He stops Geralt in the gateway, asking him to promise not to return, which Geralt refuses, and Eist lowers the gates, imprisoning the Witcher.

Yennefer approaches a huge archaeological dig in Nazair, she offers a Letter of Safe Conduct to the guards who ask how long will she be staying? She says, ""That has yet to be determined,"" as Istredd approaches warily. He happily shows her around and recounts tales about his work to his old lover; as she listens, Yennefer drinks beer she is offered. He laughs at her expression, it's apparently not very tasty, but he says the people of Nilfgaard aren't starving, and they appreciate everything they get. Yennefer says it sounds like he capitulated, but Istredd hesitates, disappointing her attempt to draw him in again. He takes her to a mess hall and says she could have anyone she wants, she agrees, and she has had many, but she ""might be missing him"". She tries to persuade him she would go away with him, that he is the only one who offered her true love and she kisses him; Istredd responds, but he's still doubtful. Slowly, he tells her how he tried to go to Aedirn, but it was she who always refused his requests. Stregobor snapped him out of his heartbreak, forget Yennefer, get work, and Istredd says it was the work that saved him. He still loves her, she has opened fresh wounds, even after decades. He says sadly, ""At least you kept your eyes,"" and leaves.

Vilgefortz of Roggeveen sits down in Istredd's empty chair, Yennefer thinks at first he's just trying to pick her up, but he's from Aretuza, he says he has no Letter of Safe Conduct, and hers is fake, so they need to GO. Vilgefortz tells her Nilfgaard has been picking up stray mages who have left Aretuza, putting them in service. He says Tissaia told him Yennefer was her best student: he convinces her to return with him.

In the halls of Aretuza, Yennefer watches novice students wander the halls, while Vanielle and Vilgefortz try to catch her up on everything at once. But Yennefer is interested only in Tissaia, and she is irritated to learn Tissaia did in fact NOT request her, she had only told Vilgefortz of her talents. Disgusted, Yennefer walks away from the mages and heads to the student dormitory, hearing echoes of her past. She barges into her former room, startling the new occupant giggling with her friends. They try to make excuses they were working on botany, but Yennefer tells them their work is pitiful, she should turn them all in, then amends her rebuke, she says Tissaia is an Old Bag, making the girls giggle. She tempts them into mixing herbs, but they've been cautioned not to experiment, and Yennefer tells them to think for themselves; then she mixes a potion and gets the girls high. They tell her their families bought them places in Aretuza, and Yennefer is truly shocked the school is being paid, no longer just bringing in students who are magical. One of the girls is lucid enough to argue with Yennefer, she's worried they'll be punished for following the sorceress' directives, the other girls start to worry about being expelled, but Yennefer tells them there are worse things. She takes them into the grotto beneath the Tower of the Gull, tells them how becoming mages means they won't be able to bear children, and then she shows them her friends, transformed into eels powering the Tower. The girls try to leave, while Yennefer scoffs at their lack of talent.

Tissaia interrupts and shoos the frightened girls away. Yennefer starts to follow her old teacher back to her office, but other mages arrive, and Yennefer sees Triss who tells her Nilfgaard has taken Marnadel and now they're after Cintra. In the council chamber many raise their concerns Nilfgaard will attack the kingdoms they support. Artorius tries to justify the actions Fringilla (his niece) has taken in Nilfgard, while Stregobor is his typical pompous self, loyal only to himself. He criticizes Vilgefortz and his military experience, but Vilgefortz and Vanielle try to persuade everyone to convince their kingdoms to fight Nilfgaard, to gather in Sodden to fight off the invasion. Stregobor continues to argue for letting Nilfgaard take Cintra, and Fringilla suddenly enters, praising Emperor Emyr, noting Nilfgaard supports their people, while Cintra does not. Tissaia accuses Fringilla of rejecting all the teaching at Aretuza and Ban Ard and their practices, and Fringilla says no, she's modified it, she has taken students who flunked out of the academies, she's teaching them anew. When Sabrina brings up the conditions she's imposed on them, Fringilla says they're treated like soldiers while they learn. When Sabrina tries to argue, she quips there is no such thing as dark or light magic, these are ghost stories made up to frighten students. She further says if Nilfgaard takes Cintra, they won't destroy the continent, they'll be saving it. She warns the school to stay out of their way.

Stregobor and Artorius demand a vote, and Vilgefortz is amazed, first Artorius installs his niece at Nilfgaard and now he wants a vote on them taking over? Fringilla says she owes her thanks to Yennefer for refusing the post at Nilfgaard, and Artorius concurs, if they'd sent Yennefer to Nilfgaard it would still be useless and ungoverned. Yennefer pipes up, but Stregobor says she has no voice, no vote, she abandoned her post, and Yennefer is further snubbed when she rashly says she'd vote to burn it all down, and Stregobor capitalizes on her assertion. Tissaia agrees Cintra is proud and smart and difficult, but they're scared, and she is critical that Aretuza also abandoned Cintra, she thinks the academies owe it to Cintra to try again. Silence takes the chamber, and then Stregobor urges the vote once more. The majority agrees not to support Cintra. Tissaia follows Yennefer out of the chamber, she tells the younger woman yes, Aretuza is all she has, secretly she tells her former student Vilgefortz and all the other dissenters are going to fight, anyway - she asks Yennefer to join them. Please. Yennefer smiles ironically: has Tissaia ever used that word before?

Back in Cintra, while everyone is in Calanthe's chambers, Geralt escapes the gate keep where he'd been imprisoned. He fights one-on-one with Nilfgaardian forces he encounters, while Mousesack and Lazlo try to take Ciri away. Before he leaves, Mousesack and Calanthe note Ciri's scream which rattled the table; while Geralt sneaks around the courtyard, he hears Calanthe fall from her window. Re-entering the castle, Geralt finds a Cintran guard who admits his traitorous behavior. Geralt kills him messily.

Cirilla sits in a swampy wilderness building a small fire, talking with the stolen horse, wishing she'd bought food instead of gloves. One of the boys she played with in the square, Anton, approaches with another man, they are there to kidnap her and turn her in to Nilfgaard for a hefty reward. Ciri fights, in a trance she warns them of the impending war, and again shrieks in the dark with her power."

A shaken Ciri depends on the kindness of a stranger.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Marc Jobst'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"As Cintra burns, Geralt wanders the castle of the dead, having just dispatched the traitor, he is searching... for what? He sees the last dress Calanthe wore before donning her armor, hears the echoing promise he made her to protect Cirilla. He shuts his eyes against the sights around him, saddened.

In the forest he comes upon the Cintran camp and tells a man piling corpses grave robbers come to no good. The man responds a robber would be taking their belongings, and he calls Geralt a butcher; Geralt retorts if he were a butcher, the man would be dead already. Staring at one another, the man says he's trying to bury the refugees, he asks for help, but the Witcher hears a buzzing, he warns the man to leave - and quickly. The man complains, these people are dead so Nilfgaard can have more land? He continues to work as Geralt leaves, then something pops up out of the ground. The ghoul chases the man, but Geralt, his eyes blackened with his power, kills it, warning the man again to leave before he's given a deadly bitten by the scavengers underground. As the man makes his retreat, several ghouls emerge, all attacking the Witcher, and he dispatches them, but more are coming - and the Witcher been bitten...

Ciri awakens in the aftermath of her scream, the woman from the marketplace has found her, the sun has risen, Anton and the other man are dead, as well as the horse. She asks what happened and when Ciri tells her, the woman responds they got what they deserved - she takes Ciri home with her.

Sixty mages arrive on a beach, Vilgefortz says the only way north is through the elven Keep at Sodden Hill, where kingdoms Temeria and Kaedwen have pledged to support the effort and are expected to arrive two days hence. Yennefer says this is only military strategy, what are the mages going to do? Triss asks if Nilfgaard really thinks they can defeat the whole continent, and Yen tells her Istredd had told her Fringilla has been snapping up mages no longer connected to the academies. Sabrina asks Yennefer saw Istredd? Yennefer tells them she saw it all in Nazair, Nilfgaard takes everything, then gives back sops which now-desperate people are willing to accept rather than starve and die. Tissaia justifies: it's why they've come to help.

Walking down the beach with Vilgefortz, Yennefer asks why Nilfgaard made such a public attack on Cintra, why not sneak in the back way through Sodden? Vilgefortz muses she's thinking like she's military, and asks what is her real reason for coming? As they approach Sodden, she is dismayed by the sight of the run down Keep. Tissaia explains Sodden has been the stronghold for years despite its apparent decrepitude. A local leader tells them all the refugees in the Keep have lost everything, and Yennefer asks why the children aren't being taken somewhere safe? But the man responds there is nowhere else to go, so they're going to fight. Triss asks if he thinks there's any possibility of saving the world? Hopeful at the side of the mages, he says yes.

Everyone works: arrows are made, potions are brewed, explosives prepared, while the sounds of the approaching Nilfgaard troops echo through the mountain. At night, while some try to find cheer around the fires with music and ale, Yennefer listens to a local woman who tells the sorceress her husband is dead, she was pushed off her farm, her animals were stolen or slaughtered, and now all she can do is help make arrows - but she has no more feathers for fletching. Yennefer conjures more for the awed woman. As Yen walks through the camp, Triss catches up, teasing about Tissaia and Vilgefortz who seem to be dallying. Yennefer asks about Temeria, and Triss tells her Geralt helped save Foltest's cursed daughter: she wonders sometimes where he is. Yennefer scoffs Witchers are unreliable. Tissaia overhears and beckons Yennefer to come have some NOT disappointing ale. Yennefer observes Tissaia's interest in Vilgefortz, and they share a smile. Tissaia asks if Yennefer is ready to die? She replies yes, she's already lived 2-3 lifetimes, but she has no legacy, no family, she's never been satisfied, and life has nothing left to give her. Tissaia admonishes her Yennefer has a great deal yet to live for.

Cahir is short with his field Marshall, he tells Fringilla to explain to the man he doesn't understand the big picture, but she responds The Brotherhood has been sighted and she needs to test them. She reminds Cahir there's a report from the trading post where Cirilla has crossed the Aruga River, it is time for them to ""honor the White Flame."" Cahir accedes, test them, he cannot lose Ciri.

A boy brushes the horse (Clip? Clop? Which one of them perished?) and tells Cirilla his mother is a bleeding heart offering the Princess shelter. The woman enters the stable and asks Ciri to teach her son manners. They hear an explosion in the distance, and a fireball flies in the sky - it's Nilfgaard attacking Sodden.

In the Keep, Yennefer awakens just in time to deflect the weapon. In the Nilfgaard encampment Fringilla orders, ""Again,"" to a training sorceress who looks askance at a pile of robes beside her. Forming the next projectile, she begins to wither and as she drops it in the catapult, she, too, falls to dust. The next fireball is released, again blown away by the Sodden defenders. Fringilla conjures a small metal box she gives to a third training wizard, telling him to draw the mages out.

At dawn, Vilgefortz leads the remaining mages through the Keep - there are now only 22, many fled after the last night's attack. Sabrina queries how has Nilfgaard arrived two days ahead of schedule? A young-looking wizard says he has lived long enough. They watch a billowing fog emanate from the Nilfgaard encampment - it is the training wizard, he emits the eerie mist which spreads through the trees as he makes his way toward the Keep. Vilgefortz takes ten mages into the field, Tissaia directs Sabrina to her archers, she tells Yennefer to keep watch from the tower, ""Reserve your Chaos,"" Yen will oversee everyone, and the Rectoress takes Triss with her.

The man from the graveyard has rescued Geralt, Roach is trotting along behind his wagon, he cautions the Witcher to stay awake as they travel through the forest filling with the mystical mist. The Witcher is delirious, he recalls his childhood, wearing a bucket for a helmet he play-fights a dragon and promises his mother he'll make her a necklace of dragon teeth, but she says no, they must live and let live. She serves him a feast, and he sees a small golden Borch on the hearth telling the boy it's all magic, nothing is real.

Boys hand archers arrows, Sabrina takes the lead as Yennefer observes from above. The mist has covered the whole forest, now, while the troops' marching continues to reverberate. Yennefer rallies the mages telepathically; Tissaia tells an uneasy Triss, ""It's time,"" as the younger woman kneels. Removing her gloves, Triss communes with the earth, and strange mushrooms grow underfoot of the Nilfgaard forces - as they're crush them beneath the marching boots, the troops are poisoned by the gas the fungi emit. Yennefer directs Coral to stop more troops and she squeezes a fist, crushing the hearts of the approaching soldiers. Sabrina's forces toss explosives in the air and detonate them with arrows making more of the approaching troops fall.

Fringilla and Cahir lead a force, but the field Marshall is disdainful. Cahir directs the others to leave while he remains behind with a small contingent. Yennefer sees and directs Vilgefortz - he opens a portal and attacks the Nilfgaard fanatic, killing his backup. He and Cahir are well-matched, Vilgefortz can toss his weapon and have it ""re-appear"" in his sheath; Yennefer warns him to slow down, he's letting Chaos take over his attack, and Cahir abruptly removes the sword from the mage's hand so Vilgefortz' weapon does not magically return; wiping his nose, he finds it bloody. He presses Cahir what he really wants, what is he after, and Cahir responds cryptically, ""To get to the center of it all."" He attacks and tosses Vilgefortz down a hill before leaving after the other troops. Yennefer sees and she sighs heavily, disheartened.

Fringilla gathers a group of archers and opens a whirlpool of leaves in the forest floor. ""Break!"" She says telepathically, and the gates of the Keep burst open: mist flows in, and Yennefer warns everyone to take cover! Another whirlpool opens in the Keep, and the Nilfgaard archers fire through the local hole Fringilla has opened, their arrows covering the distance, anonymously killing defenders inside. Yennefer sees Vanielle among the fallen, she calls to Tissaia, frightened, meanwhile Fringilla's training wizard comes through the gate, withered as his compatriots, and as he turns to dust, the box Fringilla had given him falls to the ground.

Tissaia walks through the forest to Fringilla who tells the Rectoress she was warned to stay away. She spins a tale how Cintra was defeated because 50 ships carrying Skelligan forces were destroyed in a magical storm she conjured. Tissaia is horrified, but she tries to reason with her former student - and Fringilla reaches into her coat and tosses a black cloud of dimeritium at Tissaia. Fringilla mocks the faltering Rectoress before strolling away. She casts yet another spell to open the strange box, and slimy worms slither out.

Geralt is lurching over the side of the cart, but the man stops him, trying to keep him still. Geralt seeks his saddle bags, he takes out a healing potion and drinks half of it, then pours the rest on the bite wound - steam rises and he groans. The man says the Witcher needs a healer, and Geralt says take him to the Blue Mountains on the other side of Sodden; the man refuses, they can't get there, he'll die before they get there. Geralt feverishly says, ""He'll save me,"" and the man scrambles back on the cart, hurrying to find help. Geralt's reverie returns, his mother tricks him into taking a bucket to fetch water, but when he returns to the road they were traveling she has left him alone where Vesemir can find him.

Yennefer is recalling everyone, they're losing the fight, Atlan and Coral are killed horribly while she watches, she entreats Triss to try to block the gate while she locates Tissaia. Triss joins with the earth again, creating a weave of roots, but cannot complete it before Nilfgaard forces arrive - it's ""alive,"" attacking soldiers who try to infiltrate the Keep, but it's still not solid enough to keep them completely out. Sabrina, meanwhile, appears bewitched, as are a couple of boys who have been doing their part to help. Grabbing some of the magical explosives they climb the tower. Triss is attacked by soldiers with torches, they can't break down the gate, but they can burn the sorceress through openings in the root wall. Yennefer calls desperately for Tissaia from the tower. The boys and Sabrina have ascended the stairs, Sabrina stabs Yennefer in the belly with an arrow, but Yennefer spies one of the slimy worms poking out of Sabrina's ear. The boys drop the explosives they carried onto the stores below and the detonation causes the tower to collapse, throwing the two women down. Sabrina is lucid again, she weakly apologizes to Yennefer who assures her she knows it wasn't her fault. Yennefer tries to reach out telepathically once more, but is devastated by the sight of the dead, including the woman she had helped with arrow fletchings. Triss is alive, barely, being tended, and Yennefer calls out to whoever remains to return to the Keep. Fringilla calls to her telepathically, offering Yennefer sanctuary in Nilfgaard, trying to tempt her with unlimited power.

Vilgefortz regains consciousness in the woods, and finds another mage suffering from his wounds. Insane, he crushes the man's head with a mace and Yennefer is appalled by what she sees him do. His face is inscrutable. Tissaia regains consciousness alone where Fringilla left her in the woods.

A woman tells Geralt he is not dead, she gives him water, and he says it tastes juniper and burdock; he sees Renfri, she tells him gangrene was setting in, but she's neutralized the toxins. He feels magic in the air, and now Yennefer tells him she's tended his wound, he'll heal. He weakly asks she knows his name? And his mother is there, she says she's a sorceress - but he knew that already, didn't he? She tells him his slowed pulse saved him, and he acknowledges he is a Witcher, but SHE knew that already, too, didn't she? He thanks her, she says she heard the merchant calling for help. She tells him people linked by Destiny will always find each other, and Geralt is now fully awake and fully agitated, he realizes this healer is his mother, Vissena. He asks does she like his eyes? They're changed because of his mutation, he demands she tell him she did NOT know that only three out of ten boys sent to Kaer Mohren survive the trials - he's truly upset, nearly on the verge of tears. She tells him to sleep, there's nothing she can say that will ever satisfy him, tells him to find Cirilla, and she soothes him, ""I was just a dream."" Geralt pleads with her not to leave.

He awakens on the ground, and asks where is the woman? The merchant laughs, Geralt called out for so many, which one? He tells Geralt he does not have much to pay the Witcher who saved his life, but he can offer the Law of Surprise. Not to be caught in THAT trap again, Geralt says just give him an ale, now can they just GO right now?

The battle rages, the Nilfgaard force are winning, and Yennefer finds Tissaia, finally. She tries to bring the Rectoress back with her, but the older woman is too weak to go the distance. Yennefer tells her she'll never forget Tissaia saved her, but the Rectoress tells Yennefer HER legacy is to save everyone. ""Forget the bottle, let your Chaos explode."" Yennefer climbs a boulder and recalls every hurt she has ever experienced: flames shoot from her hands, and Tissaia braces herself to die, but Yennefer has control, she has shielded her teacher from the conflagration. Screaming, the magical fire envelops the entire forest, destroying the invading forces, but Tissaia is protected. Cahir watches, resolute. Foltest arrives with his army and watches the carnage.

In the farmhouse the woman tucks Cirilla in, offering comfort. She reassures the girl the battle is close, but they'll be OK, Nilfgaard has no reason to come to them here. She intimates to Ciri her life is simple, but she has everything she could ever have wanted, health, a roof overhead, a son she loves, a good husband, and now - perhaps she has a daughter? She says she was meant to find Ciri, and she blows out the candle as Ciri drifts off to sleep.

Tissaia is surrounded by the ruin of the forest, she calls for Yennefer, and Geralt, in his dream, echoes the Rectoress' cries. Cirilla wakes up, she has heard them both call, and then she hears Calanthe repeat Geralt is her Destiny. She sneaks out of the farmhouse in the early morning light, just before the merchant, Yurga, returns with Geralt. The woman is his wife, and she assures him their son, Natbor is safe. Yurga asks her for ale for the Witcher, he has much to tell her, and she says she's got a surprise for him, too, a girl she found in the woods: hearing the echo of Renfri's prediction, Geralt jumps off the cart and heads into the woods, seeking the Princess. They see one another through the trees, and Cirilla runs toward the Witcher - he embraces her protectively, repeating to her they are linked by Destiny, and she looks up at him inquiringly, ""Who is Yennefer?"""

To complicate things, an ea... Read all",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Alan J. Levi'],"['', '']",[],['animal in episode title'],[],"A rocket is sent up with a scene change to the control room where a man named Bogard is briefing some other men on the mission of the satellite that the rocket is taking up. Essentially, the satellite is going to scan the southwest with high-res photography in order to find Airwolf's hiding place. Archangel warns Hawke that Bogard is doing this as he is headed to Washington to answer inquiry of a Senate Committee.

Hawke and Santini are working with the military filming aerial sequences for a film. Using information that Archangel provided him, he hides Airwolf in an aircraft boneyard in one of the few gaps in the satellite scan. As Hawke and Santini continue to prepare for the next photography run, another pilot is aided after she hails a mayday trying to get to Santini in order to potentially gain employment.

After Hawke and Santini find a homing device inside the Santini Air Jet Ranger and notice a tailing chopper, they think that the woman they helped is actually part of the plot to locate Airwolf. Hawke talks with Dominic about the ""coincidences"" going on and how there is no such thing.

Back at Hawke's cabin, he receives a visit from Bogard who basically threatens Hawke to give up Airwolf. After Bogard departs, Hawke radios Dom to prepare for an early wake-up so that they can get to their photoshoot early. Dom goes in the Jet Ranger to pick up Toni Donatelli (Mayday pilot) to help with shooting the military footage. As they head out, Dom has buttoned up the biplane with Hawke in it so that he can head to the boneyard to pick up Airwolf.

Bogard, though, has a ground based radar that picks up the Jet Ranger and the biplane. Bogard and his posse move to intercept Airwolf and do a decent job of surprising Hawke. As Hawke contemplates what to do, he decides to set Airwolf down. But not without pointing his nose down the runway and then hitting the turbos. He zooms down enough runway to get under the intercept choppers and then lift off.

As Hawke heads to the bombing range where a flight of about 12 B-52's are about to unload a very large amount of ordnance for a video shoot, Bogard continues his pursuit. As his posse nears the range, they break off as the high altitude F-4's continue pursuit. As the bombers enter final run for bomb release, all aircraft break off. Dominic is on the ground trying to convince the Colonel in charge of the photoshoot to call off the bombers. MSgt Nash happens to be an employee of Bogards and overrides the Colonel's attempt to abort the bombers. Bogard lands on site where Nash and Santini are at to oversee the bomb drop as Hawke flies through it.

Bombs explode everywhere around Hawke as he continues his low-level flight through the range. By the time the last bomb goes off, Dom is convinced that Hawke is dead. Bogard claims that he will take full responsibility as the Colonel orders Nash and Bogard to be placed under arrest. Suddenly you hear ""Briar Rabbit to Briar Fox."" Hawke made it. Bogard is taken into custody as Archangel debriefs Hawke on the results of the Senate hearing.

In the end, Airwolf is still safe, Archangel is clear and Toni is offered a job with Santini Air and The FIRM."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0558720/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"Mary Alice takes her own life, taking us into the lives of her family, friends and neighbors; At Mary Alice's funeral, Susan meets Mike, a new neighbour.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Charles McDougall'],[''],[],"['15 year old', 'unaired tv series pilot']",[],"Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) seems to have the perfect suburban life. At least, that's what she tells us in a voiceover. So it's a bit shocking when she steps inside her house and shoots herself in the head. Mary Alice may be dead, but we soon realize her voiceovers will live on as narration from beyond the grave.

Mary Alice's suicide rattles the other residents of Wisteria Lane, including her closest friends. There's former high-powered businesswoman Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), who is unable to manage her three unruly boys. There's klutzy single mom Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher). There's model-turned-trophy-wife Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria Parker). And, finally, we have the perfect homemaker, Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross). These four ladies were Mary Alice's best friends. And not a single one of them has a clue as to why she killed herself.

At Mary Alice's wake, Susan meets plumber/hunky new neighbor Mike Delfino (James Denton). Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), urges her mom to make the first move. So, Susan brings Mike a housewarming gift. But she's not the only one interested in Mike; Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan), the most predatory divorcee on the block wants him to come by and ""take a look at her pipes."" When Susan goes to invite Mike over for dinner, she's alarmed to see Edie is already there. So she lies about having a clogged drain. We admire Susan's initiative as a hot, prowling divorcee, but we question her commitment to her daughter's education once we see her stuff Julie's school project down the drain to create the aforementioned clog.

Nosy neighbor Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook) tells Susan that Edie is having a man over that night. Susan assumes it's Mike. She goes over, measuring cup in hand, to ""borrow a cup of sugar."" It's all very neighborly until Susan sneaks into Edie's house through the back door. While Edie is busy with her gentleman caller, Susan accidentally knocks over one of the many candles burning in the living room. The room erupts in flames and Susan bolts, leaving her measuring cup behind. Gathering with the rest of the neighbors to watch the raging fire, Susan is relieved to see Mike stroll by. He wasn't the one with Edie after all. You know, Susan never did get that cup of sugar.

Lynette is mortified when her three sons jump into the pool at Mary Alice's wake. She wades in, fully dressed, to get them out. When she runs into an old work colleague at the grocery store, a frazzled Lynette lies and says she's happy being a stay-at-home mom. Husband, Tom (Doug Savant), arrives home early from a business trip, much to Lynette's relief. But when Tom wants to have unprotected sex -- and risk getting her pregnant again -- Lynette socks him in the jaw. Tom may want to think again about getting some protection.

Gabrielle doesn't want to attend a party with her hubby, Carlos (Ricardo Chavira). It's being thrown by Carlos' boss, who is always trying to grope her. As soon as Carlos is gone, Gabrielle falls into the arms of her teenage gardener, John (Jesse Metcalfe), with whom she's been having a secret affair. Heading out for the boss' party, Carlos notices the yard hasn't been mowed. Rather than risk having John fired, Gabrielle sneaks away from the party and mows the lawn -- in her long dress and high heels. Landscaping never looked so good!

Bree's children bemoan her stuffy, formal dinners. So the family dines out at the Saddle Ranch Chop House, where Bree's husband Rex (Steven Culp) shocks her by saying he wants a divorce. Instead of answering him, Bree fixes him a salad from the salad bar, where she accidentally piles on onions, which Rex is deathly allergic to. At the hospital, Rex tells her he's sick of her being so perfect all the time. Her response is to disappear into the bathroom to water his flowers, where she wipes away the tears before coming back out.

Mary Alice's teenage son, Zach (Cody Kasch), wakes up in the middle of the night to find his father, Paul (Mark Moses), excavating something buried underneath the pool. We're not sure what is going on, but we do know that midnight pool excavations are rarely a good thing.

As Mary Alice's friends clear out her clothes, they find a handwritten note that arrived the day she killed herself. It reads, ""I know what you did. It makes me sick. I'm going to tell."" Susan asks, ""Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?"" Now that we're hooked on these housewives, we're pretty desperate to know what Mary Alice did, too."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0558699/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"Gabrielle goes to great lengths to hide her affair with her gardener, John; Lynette tries to discipline her twin boys with tough love; Bree and Rex try marriage counseling.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Larry Shaw'],"['', '']",[],"['close up of lips', 'close up of mouth']",[],"Gabrielle (Eva Longoria Parker) and her young lover, John (Jesse Metcalfe), are surprised when her husband Carlos (Ricardo Chavira) comes home unexpectedly. John jumps out of a window, but fortunately Carlos doesn't see that he's naked from the waist down, only that he's trimming the hedges as usual. Carlos surprises her with an expensive necklace but she is blase. He asks her what's bothering her and she says their marriage isn't exciting enough anymore and that she wants him to surprise her more often. She shows up at John's after deciding it's too dangerous for them to keep meeting at her house. After they have sex, he presents her with a single red rose. ""It's perfect, just like you,"" he says, and she realizes he's in love with her. Carlos surprises Gabrielle with a brand new sports car. When he asks her if it's the best gift she's ever gotten, she lies and says, ""Yes,"" even though John's gift clearly meant more to her.

Susan (Teri Hatcher) and the other women try to decide what to do about the blackmail note they found in Mary Alice's things. When Susan stops by to see her husband, Paul (Mark Moses), he tells her he doesn't care what Mary Alice's reasons were, so she hangs on to the note. Meanwhile, Paul has dug up a trunk that was buried beneath the pool. He wraps it in plastic and dumps it in a local lake, but it surfaces almost as soon as he's gone.

Bree (Marcia Cross) asks Rex (Steven Culp) if he'll cancel the meeting with the divorce lawyer and start going to a counselor instead. At Dr. Goldfine's (Sam Lloyd) office, Rex says Bree doesn't like to talk about her feelings, and that he doubts she even has any. But Bree's too distracted by a loose button on the doctor's jacket to listen. When Rex is delayed for their next meeting, Bree meets with the doctor alone and instead of telling him her problems, she insists he let her mend his button.

Mrs. Huber (Christine Estabrook) helps Edie (Nicollette Sheridan) go through the ruins of her house and gets suspicious when Edie denies that a still salvageable measuring cup is hers. Mrs. Huber finds out from Julie (Andrea Bowen) that Susan had lost her measuring cup and puts two and two together.

Lynette's (Felicity Huffman) rambunctious boys won't buckle up in her minivan and she is pulled over by a cop. But when the officer criticizes her mothering, she snaps and he is so intimidated, he lets her off with a warning. Mrs. Huber gives Lynette advice on how her mother dealt with her: she would leave her by the side of the road and drive off. In desperation, Lynette tries the tactic. But when she comes back for her boys, they're nowhere to be found. A neighbor has taken them in, and is threatening to call social services on Lynette. But the boys attack the woman, coming to their mother's defense. They may not be perfect, but at least they're loyal.

Susan is horrified when she runs into Mike (James Denton) while she's throwing out the garbage in her bathrobe, sans makeup. She asks him to dinner anyway, but since she's a terrible cook, he offers to host. Edie stops by as Mike and Susan are unloading groceries and Susan has no choice but to invite her. Susan is discouraged when Mike's dog, Bongo, doesn't seem to like Susan, but adores Edie. To get Bongo to like her, Susan dabs gravy on her ear. All goes well, until Bongo starts choking -- he's swallowed her long, dangly earring! The evening is over as Mike rushes Bongo to the vet. Mike tells Susan he was so upset because Bongo was his late wife's dog. Susan is relieved Mike isn't mad, but she realizes he's still not over his wife. What she doesn't know yet is that he's keeping a gun, a pile of money, and a map of Wisteria Lane in his kitchen cabinet."

She then sabotages the springs of the sleeper sofa.

Susan (Teri Hatcher) convinces the other women to go through with a dinner Mary Alice had planned. Bree agrees to host. Susan despairs at being the only single woman there, but then Mike (James Denton) jogs by. The men of Wisteria Lane are less enthusiastic about the dinner -- Carlos (Ricardo Chavira) is busy and Tom (Doug Savant) says he's too tired from traveling and begs Lynette to cancel the sitter. Rex is tired of keeping up appearances about his and Bree's marriage. She informs him that their cover story for therapy is they're taking tennis lessons.

After arguing with her ex-husband Karl (Richard Burgi), Susan feels bad and asks him to come over, intending to apologize to him. When he stops by, he catches her just out of the shower, wearing only a towel. During their ensuing argument, she slams his car door angrily -- right on her towel, which he takes with him as he drives off. She's naked in her front yard! And she's accidentally locked herself out! She's hiding in the bushes when Mike happens by and says he'd love to go to dinner. ""I assume the dress is casual,"" he jokes at her expense.

Zach (Cody Kasch) finds the gun Mary Alice used to kill herself and demands to know why his father kept it and why he won't talk about her at all. Just then Bree stops by to invite them to dinner, but Paul (Mark Moses) declines. Zach is disappointed but thanks Bree for remembering his mother.

Gabrielle (Eva Longoria Parker) is making out with John (Jesse Metcalfe) in her foyer when a neighbor girl looking for her lost ball sees them through the glass door. Gabrielle decides the best bet is to bribe her with a doll. But what she really wants is a bike. When Gabrielle buys her one, she assumes that's the end of the blackmail, except now she has to teach her how to ride it!

Lynette (Felicity Huffman) blows her top when she sees photos from Tom's business trip of him downing margaritas with the guys at a Mexican restaurant. He says they can go to the dinner party, but she's already canceled the sitter, so he agrees to babysit. Irked when Tom is dismissive of the difficulties of taking care of the boys, Lynette urges the kids to load up on sugar.

At the dinner party, when Carlos peppers Rex with questions about tennis, Rex admits that he and Bree are in marriage counseling. Everyone is shocked but Bree plasters on a fake smile and says ""Dinner is served."" The mood is tense until Susan breaks the ice with her humiliating experience earlier that day. Lynette and Gabrielle both admit similarly embarrassing incidents. But the laughter stops when Bree blurts out, ""Rex cries when he ejaculates."" A furious Rex grabs his keys and leaves.

After dinner, Susan thanks Mike for being a perfect gentleman and he admits he snuck a peek. ""And for what it's worth, wow!"" he says. When Karl shows up with his new girlfriend, Brandy (Anne Dudek), the next day, Susan apologizes to both of them, even if they won't do the same for her. And then it's Brandy, not Karl, who offers the long-awaited apology.

Lynette tells Tom about the dinner fiasco and then asks him ""Are we happy?"" He reassures her by putting on a sombrero and making margaritas.

Rex is moving to a hotel while Bree cheerfully packs for him. When she asks him why this is happening, he says it's because she can't even let him pack his own suitcase.

A distressed Bree stops by Dr. Goldfine's office to ask him what Rex said in his private session. While he delays his next client, she notices audiotapes of his sessions and decides to take Rex's. Instead, she only has time to grab a tape marked ""Mary Alice."""

Munsch says that she's going to take Kappa down this year, starting by revoking their charter. Just then, Gigi Caldwell, president of the national chapter of Kappa Kappa Tau and a lawyer, walks in and says that she's not allowed to revoke their charter. Chanel then threatens Cathy and exits. The dean then tells Gigi that Kappa won't have it easy this year and Gigi tells Cathy she has a suggestion.

It's Grace Gardner's first day at college, and her father, Wes takes her in his car to the university. It is revealed that Grace's mom died when she was two. Wes begs Grace to not join a sorority, but she wants to feel closer to her mother who was part of Kappa. She convinces her roommate and new best friend Zayday to join to the Kappa sorority with her.

At the ""Rush Kappa"" party, Cathy makes the announcement that Kappa will be required to accept anyone who wants to become a pledge. Shocked at the news, everybody leaves except for a few. Chanel is beyond mad to see the new pledges left. She then introduces Hester, Tiffany, and Sam. Dean Munsch then introduces The Chanels to Jennifer, another new pledge who terrifies Chanel with her candle vlogging hobby.

The next day, Chanel goes to talk with her boyfriend Chad Radwell, president of the Dickie Dollar Scholars fraternity, about what happened at the party. He tells her that he is going to break up with her if her popularity decreases for having misfits in her sorority, and his best friend Boone supports his decision. This makes Chanel to make plan to scare the other girls so they quit the Kappa sorority.

Chanel tells Kappa's housekeeper Ms. Bean that she will burn Ms. Bean's face off by drowning her in a fryer. Chanel then explains that it won't be for real, only pretend and that oil won't be hot because they will turn off the machine. At a coffee shop at the campus, Pete Martinez, the barista, meets Grace and warns her about Kappa, saying that it's a dangerous house. Chanel interrupts their conversation and says to Grace that Pete got a little too obsessed with her last year and that she had to get a restraining order against him. Pete explains that he was a freshman with a huge crush on her, then accuses Chanel of intentionally leading him on.

After Chanel #2, Chanel #3, and Chanel #5 find a ""creepy collage"" of Chanel's face in Ms. Bean's room, Chanel decides that it's time to scare the pledges. Unaware that the fryer's on, Chanel burns Ms. Bean's face for real, causing her death. Everyone starts screaming and Grace storms out of the kitchen, intending to call the police. Chanel blackmails the other girls, except Zayday, with a trip to Cancun, Mexico, to say that Grace was the one who killed Ms. Bean if she says a word to the police. The girls then hide the dead body in a freezer, unaware that Pete is following and tracing them.

Dean Munsch is in bed with Chad after having sex, and she explains that she blackmailed him to have sex with her with academic probation and confesses that her husband left her for a 19-year-old two years ago. Chad says that he is in love with her, but she kicks him out of the room.

Grace later confesses to Pete what Chanel did, but Pete already admits that he saw them take the body and that he is the reporter of the school newspaper The Sentinel. Grace offers to be his eyes and ears inside the house so they can destroy Chanel and expose what she did. They then go to the freezer to examine the body, however Chanel and her boyfriend Chad Radwell arrive and discover the body is missing.

The Chanels are having a blood oath to promise to not say what they witnessed earlier, but Chanel #2 says she can't stay silent and goes to her room to pack her things and leave the university, but she is interrupted by Red Devil and becomes her first victim, stabbing her in the shoulder and back head. After the other Chanels discover the body, they decide to keep the body in that room until they know what to do with it.

The ""Hell Week"" at Kappa house begins, a week where the new pledges will prove that they are Kappa worthy by submitting themselves in terrible tasks made by The Chanels. Before their first task, Chanel and Grace leave to take a coffee to make peace between them, but nothing gets solved ultimately. Meanwhile, Chanel #3 and Chanel #5 bury the girls up to the head in the house garden and leave them alone so they can spend the night buried, but while the Chanel #3 and #5 are away, Tiffany gets decapitated by the Red Devil in a lawn mower, leaving the other girls screaming horrified."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4381312/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"As Chanel hazes the new pledges, the murders continues; Gigi hires security to protect the sisters; Grace learns a dark secret about Kappa house.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Brad Falchuk'],"['', '', '']",[],['faked death'],[],"Kappa Kappa Tau's ""hell week"" continues, as it welcomes Detective Chisolm and Denise Hemphill, a security guard who has rather odd methods in protecting the girls from the killer. The Chanels still don't know what to do with Chanel #2's body, who was killed by Red Devil in the previous episode. After Hester suggests to put her in food processor or boning her, Chanel decides to put the body in the same freezer where they put Ms. Bean's body. Hester promises to keep the secret of #2's death.

Grace goes to the house basement, where she founds a mysterious locked door and tries to open it. Chanel #5 catches her and says that only Chanel has the key of that door. Grace tells about the secret door to Pete, who says that people has been whispering for years that the Kappa house has a really dark secret. This makes him think that Dean Munsch's office may have some archives that can explain that secret, so they both think at the same time that they will have to break in.

They start kissing passionately but Grace stops him, saying that they can't kiss if there is a killer in the campus of Wallace University. They both agree that she will break into that secret door at Kappa house and he will break into the dean's office.

Media attention descends on Wallace University after the murder of a Kappa pledge, so Cathy's job is in risk. This problem increases when Grace's father, Wes Gardner, wants unsubscribe Grace from the school, because he fears that something could happen to her. A really flirty Munsch convinces him to keep his daughter at school, but Wes demands to be hired as a professor so that he can keep an eye on her. She says that she finds good parenting attractive.

After Grace breaks into the secret room at basement of the Kappa house, Chanel interrumpts her and tells her that room keeps Kappa's darkest secrest. Chanel proceeds to tell that a legend says 20 years ago a girl died in a bathtub that is in that basement, but was before in one of the bathrooms, giving birth. She also reveals that Cathy knew about the story but decided to cover it up so no one could find out. After Chanel leaves, Grace asks herself who the baby is. After having sex, Chanel realizes that her boyfriend Chad doesn't really love her so breaks up ith him. He return to his dormitory, with his roommate Boone.

Boone says that he is scared for the killer, so Chad, as his best friend, let him sleep with him, but clarifies that Boone will not try touch him at night like past times and will respect Chad's heterosexuality. Chanel, regretful, enters to the room to she can fix her relationship with Chad, but walks in on them sharing a bed together and believes that Chad is gay. After he explains the situation, that Boone was scared and nobody knows that he, Boone, is gay, Chad breaks up with her for being an ""spoiled, homophobic little girl.""

Pete breaks into Munsch's office, and finds an archive with some names that can be related with Kappa's past, so he writes them on a sheet. Unaware that Red Devil is behind him, the killer hits him in the head. Pete wakes up tied outside of building with a note that says ""MYOB"" (Mind Your Own Business). At his dormitory, Grace tells him about the Kappa legend and he, shirtless, shows her the names that he wrote on the sheet. Grace opens the closet to give him something to put on, but discovers the Red Devil costume, which happens to be the mascot of the university. Grace freaks out and asks Pete about his age, he answers that he will turn 20 in a month. Scares, Grace leaves the room because that is the exact same year that the baby would have, and thinks that Pete might be the killer.

Boone goes to talk to The Chanels to tell Chanel that there is no need for her to tell everyone about his sexuality, because he wants to come out in his own way soon. He proposes that after he comes out, they accept him in Kappa, and Chanel likes the idea because that would give her a good reputation as the first girl who accepts a gay man in his sorority. Chanel #5 disagrees, but Boone leaves knowing that they will consider his idea.

At night, after Denise and her friend Shondell fall asleep outside of the Kappa house and Gigi goes on a date with Grace's father, Chanel survives an attack by the Red Devil. Denise hears her scream and goes into the house, leaving Shondell sleeping in the car. The girls want to go upstairs to see if the killer is still there, but the truth is that he now inside of Denise's car killing Shondell. Denise tell them to not go upstairs but they do, so she returns to the car and finds Shondell dead, while the girls find a note written on the wall that says ""SLUTS WILL DIE"". Inside the Dickie Dollar Scholars house, its members find a dead Boone laying on the dinner table with his throat cut.

Chad and Denise interrumpt the last dinner of ""hell week"" at Kappa, to announce that Shondell's body has desappeared and that Boone is dead. At the end of the episode, Red Devil goes to the mortuary and opens a drawer where Boone's body is in. Boone later opens his eyes and the episode ends with him saying to the Red Devil ""What took you so long?"" taking his throat slashing make-up off, revealing that he is Red Devil's ally."

When checking to see if the other driver is all right, she finds a trail of blood leading into the forest. Following it, she encounters a deformed, psychotic serial killer known as Moonface (John DeSantis), dragging the driver of the other vehicle. Narrowly escaping him, Ellen flees into the forest, with Moonface following her trail.

Through flashbacks spread throughout, Ellen is shown receiving training from her survivalist husband Bruce (Ethan Embry), training her with both weapons and guerrilla tactics. She attempts to use these skills several times, but despite her best efforts is still captured by the killer, taken to his workshop deep in the forest on a ridge overlooking a large waterfall.

After awakening in the basement, filled with the corpses of Moonface's previous victims, she encounters the delusional man Buddy (Angus Scrimm), apparently insane but seemingly unharmed by Moonface. He speaks cryptically of the killer's methods and intent. Shortly thereafter the killer comes downstairs, turning on a generator. Police sirens begin sounding as various lights around the room begin flashing. Lifting the other woman onto a large table, he uses a drill press to remove both of her eyes.

After Moonface leaves, Buddy talks Ellen into picking the lock on the chains binding her with a sharp object that had been jabbed into her shoulder. Buddy, who seemed to be tied up, suddenly stands up and began shouting that Ellen is free. Moonface returns, and Ellen attacks Moonface and Buddy with a piece of wood. She runs upstairs where she is again attacked, but this time manages to overpower Moonface and knock him out a window. Looking out, she sees him dangling by a blanket several meters below, hanging above the waterfall. She watches as the fabric rips, turning away as he finally falls. Finding a gun, belt and boots, she leaves.

Returning to her car, she opens her trunk to reveal the body of her dead husband Bruce. In another flashback it is revealed that Bruce had raped Ellen during a brutal fight, shortly after which she strangled him with his own belt.

When Spivey intervenes, the man tells Spivey that he doesn't know what she is. Spivey shoots the man before he kills her. As he begins to console her he first notices that although she has an amazingly hot body, she has a horrifically disfigured face. Despite his initial revulsion she cuddles into his arms and he finds himself affectionately drawn to her. Spivey discovers that her name is Jenifer and that she is mute and most likely severely retarded.

That night he goes home and his wife Ruby (Brenda James) attempts to console him after learning of the shooting. As they begin to make love, he keeps picturing Jenifer and begins to anally rape his wife. She eventually forces him off her as he has lost himself in his fantasy of Jenifer.

The next day he visits Jenifer at the mental hospital to check on her. A male orderly comments that she has been freaking out the male staff. When he enters her room she is still in the shower and runs to embrace him completely nude. Spivey takes her to his home because he can find nowhere else that will take her.

Bush) is running for reelection during a divisive war, and one of his speech writers, David Murch (Jon Tenney), goes on TV to speak with talk show host Marty Clark (Terry David Mulligan) and strident right-wing sexpot (and Ann Coulter-like) Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill). Another guest is Janet Hofstader (Beverly Breuer), the Cindy Sheehan-like mother of a dead soldier, who demands to know what her son died for. Murch gets a bit teary-eyed and explains that he lost his older brother Philip (Ryan McDonnell) in Vietnam.

""Believe me,"" he tells the grieving mom, ""if I had one wish, I would wish for your son to come back, because I know he would tell us how important this struggle is."" Cleaver is so impressed with Murch's handling of the situation that she takes him out for a drink later, picks his brain, and eventually seduces him. The Karl Rove-like Kurt Rand (Robert Picardo) interrupts their tryst, calling to let Murch know that the president plans to make his line part of his stump speech.

Soon, the soldiers killed in Iraq do start returning from the dead, and it doesn't go the way Murch predicted. They are not back to feast on the living, but unhappily for the president and his supporters, they just want a chance to vote in the upcoming election. ""We'll vote for anyone who ends this war,"" one explains. The spin machine goes into overdrive, but the dead are determined to make their voice heard even going as far as one soldier killing Kurt Rand by acting out the zombie stereotype (gouging his eye and slamming his head into the table) when Rand tried to force him to sign an unwanted document by threatening the soldier's mother.

While voting results are being counted during the election, people within the current administration decide to skew the results so the current administration remains in power. After the election results are broadcast, more soldiers begin to return from the dead - but not just ones from Iraq: Soldiers begin to return from World War I and II, the Vietnam War, the Civil War, and etc. Eventually all of the people who died during war time to protect the United States of America have returned from the dead to seek their revenge.

The progress of the movie also reveals a shadowy mistake from Murch's past. He believed that his brother Philip was murdered in the Vietnam War only to discover that it was he who unintentionally killed him long ago with a gun in a game of ""friend or foe"". After Cleaver attacks the soldiers with her shotgun, Murch kills her and fails to kill himself. Murch is countered by a soldier that asks him to join them, saying ""We're looking for a few good men."" Philip is among those returning from the grave, saying he forgives Murch for killing him, and then snaps Murch's neck.

Now one of the zombies, Murch announces that he will show anyone who sends their brothers and sisters to die for a lie the true face of hell."

One of these truckers leaves the lodge to urinate and overhears a fellow trucker screaming in pain inside one of trucks. Curiosity piqued, the drunk trucker checks the truck out but walks away after it goes quiet. Moments later, the door is kicked out.

The next morning, Detective Dwight Faraday (Brian Benben), a burned-out detective whose main priority is dealing with animal attacks arrives at the lodge. He and his partner, Officer Jacob Reed (Anthony Griffith), are sent out on a call to investigate a strange call about a possible animal attack/murder. Upon arriving, the officers are shown the truck from the opening sequence, and determine that the door to the truck was kicked out by something extremely powerful.

Detective Faraday enters the truck with the formerly drunk trucker from last night, and determines from a jaw bone that the unrecognizable mass of blood and pulp was human. Faraday then questions the locals as to what happened and determines that the now pile of pulp was seen with a beautiful, Native American woman before he died who had the ""eyes of a deer caught in headlights"". Then, Detective Patterson (Alex Zahara) takes over the investigation and after a verbal battle with Faraday sends Faraday back to the station to deal with a ""royal rumble"" between a woman whose dog was bitten by a monkey and the man who owned the monkey.

Back at the station, Faraday is nonplussed by the monkey-dog case before him and obviously distracted by the mystery of the dead trucker, and comes to the realization that the victim was trampled from the groin upwards, leaving the dog-monkey case people in a state of comedic confusion.

Faraday then goes to see the body and exchanges banter with Dana (Sonja Bennett), the attending coroner, and determines that the man died in a state of arousal and has hoof prints on what is left of his body.

Elsewhere, a business man encounters a beautiful, albeit silent Native-American woman (Cinthia Moura) who takes the man to a hotel and proceeds to give him fellatio with the man leaning back, saying ""Today is my lucky day."" His statement is proven ironic, as he is later labeled the second victim of this murder mystery. Afterward, Dana and Faraday ponder how the murder occurred; thinking about having a deer in the cabin, or even that a woman used a deer leg as a weapon.

Faraday goes home and tries to figure out the possible cause of the event, and his opinion on the probability. First, he considers the two going to the truck, at which time the woman pulls out a deer leg and beats the trucker with it. This is decided to be ""stupid."" Second, he considers the two walking to the truck, the girl hearing something moving around. When the two get in the truck, they hear something. When they look out, the two start to scream out in terror at a small deer with one point antlers. This is decided to be ""retarded."" Finally, he imagines the two walking out to the truck, the trucker states he did not leave the door unlocked. The two go in, when an anthro deer man is noticed in the front seat. The deer, dressed in jeans and red and black flannel, beats the trucker to death, kicks the door off, carries the woman off, then comes back and puts the door back in place.

Elsewhere, the same mysterious Native American woman walks into the shop of a blond Southern man and uses her charm to seduce this man. This is the first time when the Deer Woman is alluded to directly as the camera captures her standing in front of a deer head, making it seem that she has antlers.

In the morning, Reed confronts Faraday about finding a new dead body and tries to ask Faraday why he seems so burned out and listless. Faraday dismisses the possibility of opening up to Reed, and the audience learns that he is divorced and still traumatized by some occurrence in his life. Then, Faraday and Reed go down to the morgue to examine the new cadaver. The cadaver is that of the business man, and Dana shows him the same markings that she found on the previous victim are noted: state of arousal, trampled, deer hooves. However, small deer hairs are found and the team makes the perpetrator out to be a deer. In addition, they determine that the same beautiful mysterious woman was seen before the crime occurred. Then the body of the Southern shopkeeper is carted in, without an arm, and in a brief awkward comedic moment, Reed and Faraday head off the new crime scene.

Upon arriving, they discover the arm of the dead shopkeeper on the roof and are confronted by other investigators about their presence at the scene. While Reed and Patterson are fighting about Faraday's right to be there, Faraday measures the distance between the bloody hoof prints left at the scene. The two are quickly kicked out of the scene and leave for home. Faraday decides to walk home. As he passes the Native American mural, seen in the beginning of the episode, he stops at several places where the Deer Woman image is portrayed. A mugger attempts to attack the detective, which he foils, and in anger at the stupidity of the criminal, stabs the would-be mugger in the arm with his own knife. In the background watching the entire scene, the Deer Woman watches in cautious awe and disappears into the shadows.

Faraday tries to convince his skeptical boss about the presence of a so-called 'deer creature' living within the city, mentioning a mutant wolf-like creature that was shot dead in Piccadilly Circus, London in 1981, (a reference to the film An American Werewolf in London). The police chief is skeptical, but can't come up with a better explanation and gives Faraday the case.

Faraday and Reed travel to a casino on a local Indian reservation where they learn from the casino pit boss about a Native American legend about the 'Deer Woman'; a spirit who takes the form of a beautiful young woman, but with her legs in the form of deer legs, who emerges from the forest to sexually arouse and kill men just for the ultimate thrill of it. The open-minded Faraday believes the story, but the skeptic Reed doesn't and wanders off. Faraday travels back to the police station to look up more history about the Deer Woman. Reed then unknowingly runs into the Deer Woman right at the casino, and offers to play the game of craps to impress her.

Later that evening, Reed returns to his apartment with the Deer Woman when Faraday calls from the station and informs Reed that he's found old news reports that happened over a hundred years ago when eleven loggers in the woods were found trampled to death. Reed tells Faraday that he's got a woman with him and asks to call him tomorrow. Suspicious, Faraday asks Reed if he knows the woman and if he's seen her feet or legs. Reed suddenly realizes that the woman is the Deer Woman and yells to Faraday to send backup. The Deer Woman overhears the conversation and attacks Reed.

Faraday races to Reed's apartment, but is too late, as Reed already dead, bludgeoned to death on his living room floor. The Deer Woman approaches Faraday, who instinctively shoots her in the shoulder. Examining the Deer Woman's body, Faraday pulls up her long skirt to reveal..... deer legs. Reviving, the wounded and angry Deer Woman kicks Faraday across the room with her powerful legs and flees. Faraday runs to his car and gives chase which leads to a lonely road into the woods.

Faraday catches up to the Deer Woman and rams his car into her, pinning her to a tree. Incredibly, the Deer Woman tries lifting Faraday's car off her, in which he shoots her several times, until she suddenly disappears without a trace. With the unexplained disappearance of the Deer Woman, Faraday ends up laughing hysterically at the irony of his being assigned to ""animal attack,"" the statement he keeps repeating."

He is hired by an old cinephile, Mr. Bellinger (Udo Kier) to find the only existing print of a rare thirty-year old movie, La Fin Absolue du Monde (French: The Absolute End of the World). The film supposedly led to a homicidal riot at its first screening at a small Catalan film festival. Following this, it was apparently destroyed. Bellinger, however, is convinced that the original cinematic print still exists.

Sweetman initially suggests that the film is an urban legend. Bellinger leads Sweetman to a hidden room in his mansion, which contains an emaciated, pale man (Christopher Redman) in chains. The man has wounds on each of his shoulder blades; strange bones protrude from the wounds and appear to be the source of a pair of angelic wings suspended from Bellinger's wall that, Bellinger explains, are props from the film. The chained man explains that his existence is bound to the existence of the film. Bellinger then offers Sweetman $100,000 dollars to find the film, which Sweetman forces him to increase to $200,000.

Sweetman begins his research with the riot that occurred after the film's original screening. He finds that according to contemporary records, the theater burned to the ground. Four audience members died, and the rest were driven insane. He also finds his first lead: a critic who wrote a review of the film, now living in Carthage, New York (director Carpenter's hometown). Sweetman flies there and finds the critic typing furiously at a typewriter. The man claims to be writing a second review, which he insists is ""the real review."" He is surrounded by tens of thousands of pages of typed paper, all part of his review. He begs to see the film again, and offers Sweetman an audio tape of an interview with the film's director.

Sweetman flies to France, and listens to the tape in his hotel room. He begins to experience flashes in his vision that resemble the cue marks (the so-called ""cigarette burns"" of the title) on cinematic film. Sweetman has a hallucination in which he sees his late wife in the same state he had found her in upon her suicide. He then wakes up.

Sweetman then goes to see an acquaintance in the rare film business. His friend reluctantly tells him that he was the projectionist at a secret screening of the film a number of years earlier. He was spared death and insanity because he turned away from the film as it played. Eventually, he tried to stop the film, but blacked out, only to wake up with his left hand horribly burned. Sweetman learns that the cinematographer and director are the only two survivors of the original screening, but the friend explains that the director is certainly dead, and the cinematographer has gone blind and will attack anyone who asks him about the film. Sweetman's friend begs him to stop searching for the film, but Sweetman dismisses his pleas.

His friend eventually sends him to a warehouse, where Sweetman meets a deranged filmmaker. He is invited inside, and notices that the windows are covered in what appears to be human skin. In the room is a box marked La Fin Absolue du Monde, which holds several production stills from the film. After viewing the stills, Sweetman is seized by the filmmaker's bodyguards, injected with an anesthetic, and blacks out.

Waking up, Sweetman discovers that he and the cab driver who brought him to the warehouse are tied up in chairs. The filmmaker enters the room wielding a machete. He kills the cab driver while his bodyguards film the murder. He explains to Sweetman that he believes the act of murder has become an art form, and La Fin Absolue du Monde is the apex of that art form. He says that an angel was mutilated in the film, and the evil of that horror affects all who view the film. Sweetman experiences another vision of ""cigarette burns."" When he comes to he finds himself holding the machete. The bodyguards are dead and the filmmaker is on the floor before him with his throat slashed. Before the man dies, Sweetman tortures him to force him to reveal the film's location. The filmmaker replies, ""Katja.""

Sweetman flies to Vancouver, Canada to speak with Katja, the director's widow (Gwynyth Walsh). She confirms that the director is dead. When he asks about the producers of the film, she says that her husband never revealed their identity, only their interests""chaos, sorrow, suffering, and famine."" The widow gives Sweetman the film, claiming it was a curse upon her home from the moment her husband brought it there. When he asks how the director died, the widow reveals that he slashed his own throat, and hers as well, though not fatally in her case.

Sweetman brings the film to Bellinger and collects his payment, then returns to his own theater. Bellinger loads the print into a projector and sees upon the screen the ""angel"" locked in his mansion. Meanwhile, Sweetman arrives at his theater to find the doors chained. He is informed by telephone that his father-in-law locked the theater in his absence. He receives a phone call from a distraught Bellinger, and returns to the mansion. There he finds the butler standing outside the home's theater, covered in knife-wounds; the butler proceeds to gouge his own eyes out with a knife. Sweetman enters the theater to see the closing credits rolling on the screen. Inside the projection room, he finds the old man loading his own intestines into the reels of another projector, whereupon they are pulled out as the projector turns.

Fleeing the projection room for the screening room, Kirby encounters his father-in-law, who pulls a gun and threatens to kill him. They struggle for the gun and as they do, another cigarette burn envelopes the screen. Sweetman awakens to find both him and his father-in-law sitting and watching the movie, both bloody.

While the film is playing again, the butler goes to the room where the angel is being held and gives the creature the key to his chains. Back in the theater, La Fin Absolue du Monde is unspooling. There are flashes of violence that match the earlier production stills. One scene portrays two men restraining an angel as a man with a machete approaches and raises the blade; blood spatters in a manner suggesting amputation.

A cigarette burn opens in the screen, and Sweetman's late wife steps through it, appearing as she did upon her death, naked and bathed in blood. She embraces her father and bites his neck in a vampiric fashion. Sweetman wakes up again, and sees his father-in-law struggling with the air, but unharmed. Realizing that they both see his late wife, Sweetman decides that they both have to die because neither can truly let her go as long as they're alive. Sweetman then bashes his father-in-law's head against the floor until he is dead. He then picks up the gun and resumes watching the film. The smiling projection of his dead lover soon appears. He tells the apparition that he loves her, puts the gun in his mouth and then pulls the trigger.

The last scene shows the ""angel"" taking the two film reels, having been released from his prison by the butler. The angel walks into the theater, looks at Kirby's bloody corpse and says, ""Thank you for this,"" indicating the film reels, before leaving."

Upon returning home one day on her bicycle, she is struck down by a van and promptly kidnapped. She seemingly awakens in a hospital bed with a nurse (Lori Petty) informing her that she is far from home and was found in Vermont. After some odd personal questions, Tara finds out, to her shock, that she is not, in fact, where she thinks she is, and attempts to scream for help and run, which grants her nothing. The kidnapper (William Samples) apprehends her as she tries to escape, and with the help of the ""nurse"", throws her into the basement.

Tara explores the basement, finding only a young boy (Jesse Hadock) hanging from a noose, close to death. She saves him, and the two begin to form a bond. The boy, named Johnny is sweet and kind but cannot talk; he has to communicate by writing in the dust. With Johnny's assistance, Tara uncovers cryptic warnings on the walls, such as ""Beware the Fair-Haired Child!"" and ""Get out before it wakes up!"" As if that wasn't enough, the two discover a room with numerous backpacks and a bathtub stained with blood, showing that they are not the first victims in this basement.

Shortly after this, Johnny begins to breathe hard as a great gust of wind shakes everything in the basement. Tara attempts to comfort him by talking to him about the picture drawn in her book: A comic she made up of a princess befriending some seemingly evil creatures who help her out, and become the greatest friends she's ever had.

Angered with the kidnapping couple, she yells at them for the mistreatment of her and Johnny. It is then we witness his transformation from a normal boy into a monstrosity (Walter Phelan). Scared out of her wits, Tara hides from the creature successfully until it reverts into the boy she befriended. It is then he reveals his shameful secret: the couple are his parents. 12 years ago, Johnny died by drowning on his 15th birthday while trying out a small rowboat that his parents had given him as a birthday present. Desperate over the loss of their son, Johnny's parent's gain hope from a ritual book they receive from an old student who seemingly practiced occultism. By performing a ritual following the book's instructions, the parents make a deal with some entity, which involves them providing a sacrifice of one child per year until the quota of twelve is reached. Tara is the last before Johnny can become human again.

Johnny begins to cry and pound the wall, writing that he does not want to hurt her, and to forgive him. She embraces him as he begins to change. In a horrifying and graphic scene, the demon re-emerges and performs his final kill by disemboweling Tara. Soon afterward, Johnny's parents descend into the basement to find Johnny crying over Tara's bloodied corpse covered with a piece of old newspaper, with the words ""I forgive you, Johnny,"" written on it in her blood (which she apparently wrote before expiring).

After buring Tara's dead body in their garden outside, the couple then happily performs the final stage of the ritual, leading Johnny through an arch in their garden, transforming him into the beautiful, blond boy he was before his death. The next scene shows his parents calmly playing their instruments as Johnny sits quietly, looking over Tara's drawing. Upon their questioning of his silence, Johnny (speaking for the first time) responds about his jealousy of their talent and his wish for something that he himself is good at. Smiling, he informs his mother that he found it. His talent is bargaining. It is then that the lights begin to flicker and a strong wind travels through the house as his mother screams, asking Johnny what he did. He replied that it took them twelve kids to resurrect somebody. He narrowed it down to two, and they didn't have to be children. Johnny smiles sadistically as a female version of the demon bursts through the window, and gruesomely kills his parents.

Flash forward to the alive-and-well Tara waking up, curiously observing the Band-Aid on her arm (which indicates Johnny injected her with something to make her temporarily forget what had happened). She meets him in another room, and the two introduce themselves again as he takes her for a stroll to the lake. As they pass, the camera pans to the graves of Johnny's parents in the garden."

She is informed by her fellow entomologist Max Grubb (Jesse Hlubik) that her obsession with her job is the reason that her lady friends are constantly breaking up with her. Ida is crestfallen by this, although she is introduced to the beautiful and strange girl named Misty Falls (Erin Brown a.k.a.: Misty Mundae) who sits with her sketch pad drawing pixies in the lobby of the McNaughton Museum of Natural History where Ida and Max work. Instantly, Ida is enamored by the chance to be with her, although Max gives her the warning of babes or bugs, you cant have both.

Simultaneously, a mysterious package arrives for Ida at her apartment door, which is revealed to contain a large, unidentifiable mantis-like insect. Landlady Lana Beasley (Marcia Bennett) is concerned with the pets of Ida and the effect that may be lain upon her seven-year-old granddaughter Betty (Chandra Berg), dubbed The Ladybug because of her continuous habit of wearing a ladybug costume. The Ladybug looks up to Ida as a heroine influence, much to Beasleys dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names Mick, and informs Max via telephone of the creature. Mick escapes from its plastic tank shortly after Ida leaves.

The next day, Ida walks over to Misty and to asks her out to dinner, which Misty accepts. The two women go out on a date that night in a Chinese restaurant, where Misty embarrassedly states that she thinks Ida is attractive. Misty then asks whether or not that the two of them can watch a movie about Texas Pixies on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts as their date, although she is concerned about what Misty would think of her large collection of bugs.

In the meantime, Mick escapes and attacks Beasley's pet dog, dragging it into one of Ida's bedroom pillows where it consumes the animal. Later, there are posters advertising the lost dog.

The Ladybug greets Ida and Misty (whom the Ladybug calls a fairy), who then makes the humorous faux pas of stating that Betty is Beasleys daughter. Misty is introduced to the apartment, though Ida keeps her away from the bedroom where all her insects hidden. They proceed to enjoying some burbon and watching the Texas Pixies movie together. The two get closer until their moment is interrupted by Max who is curious about their date.

Ida returns to find Misty asleep on the couch. She proceeds to the bedroom and returns with the pillow (with the Bug Mick hidden inside) to give to Misty, who suddenly wakes up from her drunken slumber. Still too drunk to drive, Ida allows Misty to stay with her. In gratitude, Misty returns the favor by stripping off her shirt and seduces Ida with a flurry of passionate kisses. Below, Micks proboscis reaches for Misty and nips her ear, which Misty dismisses.

The next morning, Ida awakens to find that Misty has discovered her secret bug stash and has a great interest in bugs. She also discovers that Misty is Ida's favorite professor Malcolm Wolf's daughter (her last name came from her hippie mother), and the two search for the escaped Mick. Later, Misty feels pain in her right ear, where she finds a small sample of foreign saliva in it, and soon becomes weak to stay up.

Ida turns to Max with drawings of the creature by Misty, but Max does not take the matter seriously and even makes derisive jokes about Ida's new relationship. She comes home and finds Misty moving in. They spend more time together, although Misty (to her own consternation) begins displaying unusual tendencies, such as an appetite in straying bugs.

Beasley encounters Mick as it runs past her. About to complain, she finds Ida and Misty locked in an extremely passionate kiss. She leaves, keeping this hidden from her ever-interested granddaughter. Misty later comes across the pillow with Mick in it during a laundry excursion, and she discovers that she has strange urges to lay next to it. The insect then invades her much chewed and saliva-doused ear with its proboscis.

Ida receives an almost apologetic letter from a mysterious source, though she suspects that it is Malcolm Wolf, which tells her that the insect could be dangerous. At home, she is pulled into a loving kiss by Misty right in front of Beasley and Betty, who innocently asks if she can get a kiss from Ida. Disgusted, Beasley berates the two women, even suggesting that Ida is sexually attracted to her granddaughter as ""fresh Meat that she wants to fuck"". Beasley gives Ida and Misty two weeks to move out, which is reduced to one week when Betty asks for some skin (a handshake slap) from Ida. Ida is horrified by Mistys strange behavior and her abrupt and crude remarks, most pertaining to how Beasley despises their sapphic romance and how angered she is by Idas sadness about the things Beasley said about Betty. Enraged, Misty loses her temper and yells at Ida about how much that she has done for her until she suddenly passes out.

Misty awakens and explains about a storybook-style dream where she was a fairy resting upon a lily pad and encountered a beautiful giant bug (Mick) that landed on her and forced its proboscis into her navel, drawing blood and inserting his juices into her. Max calls Ida for her to come to the lab, and as she leaves, Ida notices how Misty has placed the pillow between her legs.

When she arrives, Max delivers the information from her Brazil homey about the insect which he finds humorous and impossible: The insect is known to inhabit the nests of birds and other small animals, where it behaves like a parasite, inserting its proboscis and drinking the animals blood, replacing what it takes with a unique toxin. This toxin the bug injects is a protein which, once it finds its way into the bloodstream, invades the hosts DNA and the bird is impregnated with the insects young. While Max finds this funny, Ida is horrified to learn that Misty may have been bitten by the insect. Meanwhile, the insect Mick inseminates Misty during a sexual meeting.

Beasley walks into the hallway, stapling an eviction notice to Idas apartment door, and encounters Misty, who asks her why she doesnt like her. Beasley states that she doesnt like the perverse nature of her and Ida, and the ""bad"" influence the two may have on her granddaughter, when Misty interrupts her with a list of crude synonyms for lesbian and the possibility that her Ladybug could grow up to like other ladybugs. Beasley is revolted, calling Misty a monster; Misty thereupon morphs two insectoid eyes and multiple tendrils. The terrified Beasley falls over the stairway to her death. Smugly, Misty removes the eviction notice from the door.

Ida arrives home to witness medics hauling away the corpse of Lana Beasley on a gurney and Betty crying. Misty makes light of the situation, much to Idas repulsion. Ida calls Max over to her apartment and she finds Misty in the bathtub who later reveals the location of the hidden predatory insect in the pillow. She is convinced that the insect has indeed infected Misty, who reveals her own secret: her father, Professor Malcolm Wolf, sent the insect to Ida so it would bite her and make her repulsive to Misty, who has long been in love with Ida.

Misty then undergoes metamorphosis into a bug-human monster. Responding to Idas screams, Max breaks into the apartment, only to be encountered and cornered by the monstrous Misty, who kills him in a gory mess. Then Mick scurries to the terrified Ida lying on the floor and inserts its proboscis into her left ear, beginning the same insemination process with her.

Some time later, both Ida and Misty are sitting in the living room couch with large pregnant abdomens, joking about their condition, as the insect Mick continues to inseminate them through left and right ears respectively."

Stacia (Fairuza Balk), a recently divorced woman, falls in between the clash of the killers.

After a transport bus breaks down, the driver and passengers, save for Stacia who left previously, are murdered by either of the two twisted killers. Fascinated, Wheeler and Walker examine each others' kills. Wheeler murders a woman (Laurene Landon) and hangs her body in the truck, and pistol whips and decapitates a man with the sliding door of the luggage compartment. Walker garrotes the bus driver with a dead snake, shoots a passenger, leaves another passenger to die tied by her wrists to a tree and wrapped in barbed wire (whom Wheeler finds alive and taunts), slaughters a punk, and partially skins his girlfriend before killing her.

Later, at a roadside motel, the two psychopaths play head games with each other and Stacia, clashing over who will be Stacia's killer. As she is leaving the motel, Wheeler offers her a ride then assaults and handcuffs Stacia while driving. He comes across Walker on the highway, standing in the lane, and brakes to a stop just before hitting him. Walker accepts a ride, and the two bicker and draw their pistols, ready to kill Stacia and each other. Stacia, sitting in the middle, slams on the brakes and sends the two murderous men through the windshield onto the road and causes the truck's cab to fall on its side. Stacia unsuccessfully struggles to get Wheeler's gun, while the wounded Wheeler and Walker fight to determine who will kill her as an ambulance siren sounds.

In the end, Wheeler and Walker are side by side in the ambulance, still fighting and cursing at one another. Finally, they cease, as Walker points out how much fun the two off them could have with an ambulance, revealing that he still has his craft knife he used to torture the stoner's girlfriend. However, one of the EMTs rams syringes into their chests, apparently killing them both, as the new killer tells the driver that they plan to save Stacia (bound and gagged in an upper bunk of the ambulance) for later. Stacia is now a helpless captive of another pair of serial killers whom are the two ambulance attendents whom kill whomever they pick up."

She refuses, but then decides to tell him the story of Ernst Haeckel and if he still wishes to revive his wife afterwards, she will.

The story mainly concerns Ernst Haeckel (Derek Cecil), an oddball pathologist from New York City who is trying to follow in the footsteps of Victor Frankenstein but is unsuccessful with his attempts to perform similar experiments. He learns of Montesquino, a necromancer, but believes that the man is a charlatan after he meets him at a traveling sideshow.

Learning of his father's ill condition, he travels to visit him in Albany. During Haeckel's journey through the countryside, he encounters Walter Wolfram (Tom McBeath) and his lovely wife Elise (Leela Savasta) whom he asks to stay for the night at their rural cabin. At Wolfram's cabin, Haeckel is oddly drawn to Elise and vice versa. Wolfram seems undisturbed by the attraction but when unearthly shrieks echo outside, Elise is drawn to them. Haeckel also notices that Elise is caring for a baby.

Elise finally goes outside and the despondent Wolfram notes that he can't satisfy his wife, although he has sold everything he has to take care of her. Haeckel goes after Elise and follows the shrieks to a nearby cemetary called 'necropolis'. There he discovers that Elise is having sexual consort with her dead husband and the other resurrected corpses. Wolfram has paid Montesquino to raise the dead so that they can satisfy Elise. When Wolfram tries to take her home, the corpses kill him. Haeckel confronts Montesquino and demands that he make it stop. The necromancer says that he cannot, and an angry Haeckel shoots him as he tries to escape. The dying Montesquino shoves Haeckel into a tombstone, knocking him out.

The next morning, Haeckel wakes up and returns to the cabin, where he finds Elise nursing the baby: a corpse-child, the son of her ""true"" husband. The baby rips out Haeckel's throat.

In the present, Miz Carnation concludes her tale and a disgusted Ralston looks on in horror as he realizes that she is actually the older Elise, as the undead corpses of her first husband, Wolfram, and Haeckel stagger in and she brings out the zombie baby. Ralston decides against raising his dead wife and flees from the cabin into the night while Miz Carnation/Older Elise and the rest of her undead clan look on."

He travels by boat with several handfarms (Shihô Harumi, Magy, Shin'ichi Tokuhara and Takao Handa). The boat hits something, but it's not a rock - it's the dead body of a woman (Miyuki Konno). The boatman (Hiroshi Kuze) says that the body weighs a ton, so he deduces she was pregnant. When he turns her over, we can see that she was heavily pregnant. Finally landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). She claims no knowledge of Komomo (Michié), but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room.

Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living. She tells him that Komomo was there, but hanged herself after her love never came for her. Distraught, Christopher seeks solace in sake. Falling asleep, he requests a bedtime story. The girl recounts her past her mother, a midwife, was forced to sell her to a brothel after her father died, and eventually she wound up on the island. Komomo was the most popular girl there, making the others jealous. When the Madam's jade ring was stolen, Komomo was tortured to confess. After suffering hideously underarms burned, needles driven under fingernails and into gums she killed herself in shame and torment.

Christopher refuses to believe the girl's story, and he pleads for the whole truth. The girl starts again, in the second telling, her family is no longer happy nor loving; her father was an alcoholic, her mother an abortionist. She was taken in by a Buddhist priest, who, presumably, molested her and inspired an obsession with hell. Her father never died of lung disease she beat him to death for raping her. Again she tells of being sold into prostitution, but gives a new version of the dark fate of Christopher's beloved Komomo. Despite the kindness of Komomo, who befriended her, the disfigured girl stole the jade ring and planted Komomo's hairpin to frame her and after Komomo was tortured, killed her. She explains to Christopher that she intended to save Komomo from hell: as Komomo would be doomed for having such an evil friend, only through betrayal could she sever the friendship and ensure Komomo a deservedly beautiful afterlife.

Christopher, losing control, is desperately convinced something has been left out. He begs for the whole truth. The woman then reveals a horrifying secret: a tiny second head in the center of a hand hidden beneath her hair her ""Little Sis"", a parasitic twin. Her mother and father had been brother and sister, ""Little Sis"" was the fruit of their incest. It was ""Little Sis"" who commanded her to kill her father, and to steal the ring. As the hand begins to talk like Komomo in a high-pitched voice, Christopher is overcome by madness and shoots the girl in the heart and then the head. Before dying, the girl's body turns into Komomo.

The final scenes shows Christopher in a Japanese prison serving time for the murder of the girl. He is kept company only by the ghosts of his past."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2525510/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,Bea Smith enters prison after being charged with the attempted murder of her husband. Bea is separated from her daughter and sent to Wentworth on remand. She is then forced to learn how the prison works.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Kevin Carlin'],"['', '', '']",[],"['prison life', 'female rear nudity', 'female nudity', 'clothed female naked female scene', 'strip search']",[],"Wentworth is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's (Danielle Cormack) early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This ten-part series takes the viewer 'inside' to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire.

The audience is introduced to Bea all over again and meets her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson (Shareena Clanton), Liz Birdsworth (Celia Ireland), and Franky Doyle (Nicole da Silva). And there are new faces such as Jacs Holt (Kris McQuade), the ruthless matriarch of a crime family that now reigns over Wentworth.

Other favourite characters also return: Meg Jackson (Catherine McClements) carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett (Kate Atkinson), the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson (Leeanna Walsman), the crusading lawyer; and Matthew Fletcher (Aaron Jeffrey) who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face - Meg's husband Will Jackson (Robbie Magasiva), whose past still haunts him.

Each episode explores an individual character's back story to show what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to prison. We discover that the difference between an inmate and a prison officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways. Like the original Prisoner, Wentworth is at its heart, a series about survival, a character drama featuring women living in a pressure cooker environment. Despite the rivalries and power struggles, this family of misfits and rebels is forced to forge unlikely friendships and alliances if they want to survive their time inside.

In episode one, Bea Smith begins her life as a remand prisoner in Wentworth after being charged with attempted murder of her husband. She is immediately caught up in a battle between Governor Meg Jackson and rising top dog, Franky Doyle.

Siding with Franky unleashes Meg's retribution as she releases the reigning top dog, Jacs Holt, back into the compound to pull Franky back into line. But a confrontation between the two vying crews results in a bloody riot and a fatal stabbing. And it is Bea who is left with blood on her hands."

The episode begins with a tragedy at an Indian wedding, where Bobby has an outburst regarding the buildings structural integrity. Also interwined with Abby and Buck seeing each other in real life for the first time because Abby's mother with alzeimers disappeared.

Bobby is speaking with a priest about how he has been hiding his past from the 118 and that they put they trust in him but he hasn't been honest with them. It then cuts to a flashback of Bobby's old life in Minnesota where he was married and had two children. It ends in tragedy when their apartment building catches on fire and his family was caught inside. (We learn later that his wife makes it out and later dies at the hospital but his children died in the fire.) Bobby blames himself for the fire because he was secretly in an abandoned apartment, with a space heater... he was drunk and didn't remember to turn it off before he went back to his apartment. He had a fight with his wife about his drinking and he went to the roof and got drunk again. He was up there when the fire alarms began going off and he tried to get back to his family but it was too late... Cut back to present day, Bobby is telling this story to the priest.

In another story of the episode, Hen was visiting her ex wife in prison and was having disagreements with her current wife about it. This causes strife and distrust in their relationship. Worried about Denny, Karen is worried about what the trouble the ex will cause in their lives if she is out of prison.

Buck continues to help Abby try to track down her mother. They hear a call over the radio about an accident end up helping a little girl stuck on a pool floatie in the middle of an electrified pool. They eventually find her mother."
