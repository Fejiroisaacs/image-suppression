His brother Frank meanwhile continues running numbers and stops at a bar next to a small store. While Frank is inside Arthur Styles, a hit man, wires a trigger mechanism with shotgun shell to the ignition of Frank's car unobserved by passerby. Frank accidentally strikes a lady with groceries - Mary Rae Dortmunder, a high school teacher. After helping her pick up her spilled groceries Frank gets into his car and is shot by the trigger mechanism

Hoyt now tells Art to stake out the apartment if Roy Chafee. The place is across the street from another apartment and Art charms the tenant in the apartment with the best shooting view of the Chafee house - which happens to be that of Mary Rae Dortmunder. Though taken aback (as as yet unaware he is a wanted criminal), Mary Rae is lonely enough to accept Art Styles into her place.

Upon learning of Frank's murder Mike orders Steve to tail Art Styles' car; Steve thus learns Styles is staying with the school teacher, but.neither as yet knows of the stakeout of the Chafee apartment since only Roy's wife is there. Mrs. Chafee doesn't know where Roy is hiding but she is due to give birth in a day or two, and the two cops stake out her place believing Roy will show up to support his wife and the arrival of their child. Mike for his part had confronted Hoyt and his partner Abby Groat about the Chafee killing and warned them to stay away from Roy Chafee - and drops a hint of a possible double cross, which winds up disturbing Abby enough when Hoyt boasts about tapping Frank's phone for a year.

After getting a phone call from Art staked out at the Dortmunder place Hoyt drives to a dockside meeting with Abby that night - only to find his car has been sabotaged by Groat. Hoyt thus is thrown in his car into the harbor. After the car and Llewelyn's body are dredged out, Mike and Steve thus must follow Mrs. Chafee when she gets a cab to a pay phone to call Roy. This of course smokes out Roy and a three-way chase soon develops between Art Styles (with Mary Rae briefly a hostage), Mike and Steve, and Abby Groat and one of his gunmen."

Edgerton returns and eventually finds the dead boy. Fearing that his brother, who was believed dead but who is actually living in the house, will be blamed, Edgerton takes the body for burial in Golden Gate Park. Stone and Keller who have been alerted about the missing boy by his mother observe Edgerton leaving the house and follow him, eventually finding him preparing to bury the boy. Edgerton is arrested but refuses at first to make any statement, only agreeing to provide any information when Stone says they will need to search the house. They find Edgerton's brother missing and begin a search in the area. One of the parents of the boys who originally broke in (Joe Rudolph) decides to take action and breaks into the house with some friends, looking for the brother who they think is responsible for deaths of the boys.

David is upset because he knows Mary is having an affair with someone, who happens to be David's own psychiatrist Dr. Charles (Ian McCulloch). One night during a storm, when Mary is away, a young woman named Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn) appears in the farmhouse stable. She tells David she is a witch from the 17th century and has used her powers to travel in time to the 20th century in order to escape from witch hunters who wanted to burn her at the stake at the very same farmhouse. David doesn't believe her and locks her in one of the bedrooms of the house. He calls Dr Charles who visits David but, when Lucinda has miraculously vanished from the locked room, he thinks David is simply hallucinating. After Charles leaves, Lucinda reappears and seduces David using witchcraft.

Mary initially doesn't believe David's claims either but is soon convinced that Lucinda is real when the latter begins to harass the couple repeatedly with witchcraft. She visits the local Rector (Lennard Pearce), who investigates and finds that there was a local witch named Lucinda Jessop who escaped being burnt at the stake in the year 1652 by Puritans who used to capture and execute witches by drowning or burning them. Mary then asks Dr Charles to help, but he refuses and Mary ends her affair with him. As Mary is returning home on horseback, Lucinda attacks her and she is hospitalized for several days.

Mary returns home determined to fight the witch and rescue David. She finds a voodoo doll which Lucinda made to cause her pain. Under Lucinda's spell, and being told that his wife is unfaithful, David locks Mary in the cellar as he prepares a pyre, convinced that it is Mary who should be burnt at the stake. Mary escapes and locks David in the stable for safety, but Lucinda reappears. The two women fight which causes the stable to catch fire. Mary tries using the voodoo doll against Lucinda by recasting it in her image, but fails. Mary throws water on Lucinda, which weakens her as witches are afraid of water. She then drowns Lucinda in a trough. With Lucinda's spell now broken, David and Mary are reunited. David picks up the voodoo doll and throws it into the fire as Lucinda's screams are heard."

She enrolls and befriends Ben Faraday (Warren Clarke), also trying to lose weight, who is paradoxically advised by the program coach Mr. Willis (James Cosmo) to binge eat and take certain pills. Strangely, the participants are also asked whether they ever had Salmonella infection. Later that night, after taking his prescribed pill, Ben hallucinates while driving and dies in an accident. Ruth learns of this and is soon approached by Andrew (Gerard Kelly) who works at a local funeral directors firm. He says Ben's body was brought there and that similar accidents have occurred in the past as this one, and he thinks his employers are in some way connected with them.

Ruth and Andrew investigate and find that the corpses are being replaced by mannequins for burial, and that the funeral directors are secretly taking the dismembered carcasses to Chesterton Clinic. Ruth gets permission from her editor (Dinah Sheridan) to expose the racket and advance her career. Ruth gets admitted to the clinic as a patient with a feigned diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, using her doctor friend's help. She prowls around late at night and finds a room with several carcasses being stored like an abattoir. She sees the clinic director Jack Rothwell (Kevin Stoney) taking one of the dismembered corpses in his car and follows him to a country mansion.

Ruth sneaks into the mansion but is discovered by Humphrey Chesterton (Richard Pearson), the owner of the mansion and Chesterton clinic. Surprisingly, she is invited to stay for a dinner party he is throwing for several guests, including Rothwell. She is told that all of the guests are survivors of a well known plane crash that occurred just over a year ago, and that they meet regularly at the mansion to celebrate and ""remember those who died"", this being their thirteenth reunion. It becomes clear that the survivors resorted to cannibalism and ate the bodies of the dead passengers of the plane crash in order to survive until they were rescued, and they mark the occasion at each reunion by eating human flesh, and victims from the Chesterton Clinic are killed and the corpses are smuggled by the funeral directors to be eaten at these reunions. Frantically Ruth runs to inform Andrew at the funeral home, but finds his corpse there, also killed by the funeral directors after he discovered their activities. Mr. Willis then appears and tells Ruth that he too was a survivor of the plane crash, before he kills her with a meat cleaver."

Shenley wants to divorce his wife Emily (Pat Heywood) and marry Lolly but Emily does not consent. Mr. Rayburn (James Laurenson) visits Shenley, saying he wishes to sell a desolate property named Lower Moat Manor through him. Norman visits the house, and starts to hear a voice saying ""you shouldn't have killed your wife on Friday the 13th"" and sees Emily's body tumbling down, after which he wakes up in bed beside his wife. Thinking it was a nightmare, Norman returns to work that morning and finds that Lolly cannot remember Mr.Rayburn's visit the previous day. Shenley revisits Lower Moat Manor, but finds that the house does not exist, and when he enters a phone booth to inform Lolly, the message comes up ""why did you do it"", smoke emits from the telephone and chokes him. Again, he wakes up beside his wife and finds that he was having another nightmare within a nightmare. And again, neither Emily nor Lolly are able to remember him recounting these events to them before.

Shenley investigates the house a third time, and is welcomed by the ghost of old Lady Strudwick (Eleanor Summerfield), apparently the mistress of the manor house. Soon he begins to hear the same voice again saying ""you shouldn't have killed your wife"", and Rayburn appears and grabs Shenley and hangs him on a noose in the house. Shenley wakes up again at home beside Emily, having had his third nightmare. Shenley and Lolly go to another apartment to discuss another sale, where they find that the place is desolate and is being demolished, with them stuck in it. Shenley runs to safety outside, and is met with by Rayburn who repeats the same sentence. Again, Shenley wakes up from a nightmare. His wife, already knowing that he has an affair with Lolly, calls the doctor, and it is told that he has a brain tumor which needs emergency surgery. During the surgery, performed by Rayburn, Emily and Lolly, Shenley dies and is put in the mortuary, when he wakes up again beside his sleeping wife, after his fifth nightmare. He smothers Emily to death.

The story ends with Norman Shenley now rushing to his office that morning to break the 'good news' about his wife's 'departure' and desire to marry Lolly, but it is shown that she cannot understand anything being said. In come the police, Rayburn one among them, who says that Emily has been found killed and that ""Shenley should not have killed her"". Shenley thinks it is just another nightmare, as if it was true, then his wife should have died days before on Friday the 13th, since he had already seen her corpse in his first dream. He is then told that the current date is Friday the 13th, Rayburn does not remember ever meeting him before, and Lolly cannot remember having had any affair with him, and no one understands what he is saying. The cops take him away, and a puzzled Lolly decides to leave the job immediately. The phone rings as she is leaving, and a voice identifying himself as 'Mr. Rayburn' asks for Norman Shenley, saying 'he wants to sell property'."

The Mortons then adopt another child, James, from an orphanage. However, once he goes to live with them, strange occurrences begin to happen. Laurie's car goes out of control as it passes the cemetery where William is buried, maggots miraculously appear in the Mortons' dinner, and a toy rabbit that Laurie gives to James becomes smeared with blood. There is no explanation for these events and throughout them all, James remains strangely calm and unemotional.

Terence is working on a protein supplement from a plant that he cultivated which may help to eliminate hunger in the poorer nations of the world. He is visited the next day by representatives from the organization he hopes to sell it to, as James takes Nipper, the family's pet Rottweiler, for a walk to the cemetery. Upon reaching William's grave, a strange wind occurs and Nipper goes wild. He runs back to the house and attacks Terence's lab rabbits, and then Terence. The couple are forced to poison the dog and bury him.

That night, James finds William's diary. It describes how neglected he felt with his parents too busy with their work to devote any attention to him. James shows it to Laurie who becomes increasingly distraught. Meanwhile, Nipper's howls are heard outside. William's ghost then appears to his parents in the lab, telling them how he was saddened as they neglected him in the midst of their busy schedules, prioritizing work over him. He kills a valued rabbit and runs away with Terence's prized plant, the basis of his years of work. Terence chases after him, despite Laurie's warning, and they reach the cemetery. In the darkness, Terence falls into an open grave and is killed. William's ghost and the plant then disappear and Laurie finds James lying on William's grave. James awakens and asks her why they are there. They look at the gravestone which now says Terence Morton and his beloved son William. The plant that was Terence's work is now growing on the grave in the shape of a wreath, which Laurie says is ""for all the unloved of this earth"", as she walks away with James."

They are sold the house by real estate agent A.J. Powers (Milton Johns), but the house was the site of a gruesome murder when an elderly man poisoned and hacked his wife to death. Soon, strange happenings begin, with creepy noises, doors that shut and do not open, leaking gas pipes, the appearance of blood stained walls and even the slaughter of Sophia's pet cat by an unknown force. Their neighbors, George and Joan Evans, do their best to help the family, even sheltering them in their house. The Peters learn about the murder case, and request the Evans not to tell anyone about the recent happenings.

Thereafter the paranormal events cease. Months later, Joan visits the family and the ghostly activities restart, forcing William to blame Joan's 'presence in the house' for it and send her away. During a children's party for Sophia's birthday, an overhead pipe breaks and blood sprays over all of the guests, triggering further panic. Emma is hospitalized with shock. William meets with the estate agent A.J. Powers, who devises a plan to send the family away to 'safety'. The news reaches the media and soon the house is known as The house that bled to death, owing to its past history and the recent events with the Peters. Powers uses this opportunity to write a book based on these events, which becomes a bestseller. The Evans learn that the Peters have abruptly left England, and that William and Emma were never married.

Three years later in California, William and Emma (who is revealed to actually be a single parent) are rich and living together, with Sophia who is now older. It is revealed that everything was a ploy, and the entire sequence of events were staged to deceive everyone into believing the house was haunted and they were forced to flee. Powers sells the film rights to his bestselling book, based on these 'paranormal' experiences, making himself, William and Emma even richer. However, Sophia (who was never told of the scam) has become quiet and detached and Emma worries she may have been affected by the traumatic events in the house. When Sophia reads Powers' book and then discovers the belongings of the old couple who lived in the house before them, she seemingly becomes possessed. Picking up the kukri from the old house, she walks into her mother's bedroom and kills William as Emma screams in horror."

Graham opts to sell most of the collection, but his wife Sarah (Angela Bruce) finds an African sculpture (called a 'fetish') with knives stuck in it. She nicknames it 'Charlie boy' and takes it home with them. En route they are involved in a road rage incident and harassed by an intimidating car driver whom they nickname 'Scarface'. Back home that night, Graham is still riled by the incident and playfully sticks a knife into Charlie Boy while thinking about Scarface. Unbeknownst to him, as he does this, Scarface is actually stabbed and killed elsewhere by mobsters.

Graham's elder brother Mark (Michael Culver) inherits the bulk of their uncle's estate, including his country mansion and his money. But after Mark reneges on a business deal with him, Graham feels slighted. That night, he angrily stabs a group photograph with Mark in it with a knife and then pushes the knife into Charlie Boy. The next day, Mark dies after being impaled in a horse riding accident. Following this, Graham's film director friend Phil is also accidentally killed on the set of a TV commercial when an arrow from a crossbow hits him. Graham and Sarah also learn of Scarface's death in the newspapers, and now realize that all of the people in the group photo which Graham stabbed are being killed one after the other, by a voodoo spell Graham inadvertently cast using Charlie Boy and the next victim will be Gwen (Frances Cuka), his Uncle Jack's housekeeper, who was also in the photo. Graham is unable to remove the knife he stabbed into the fetish. He tries to contact Gwen but, after the recent deaths that have occurred at the estate, Gwen is deeply shaken.

It is revealed that Heinz had inadvertently given details about Charlie Boy to an old gangster friend of his, Peter Macardo, who wanted a fetish in order to deal with a rival gangster in Nigeria, and Macardo burgled Graham's house to get it. Graham goes to Macardo's home to retrieve the fetish. Sarah rushes after him to stop him but she is killed in a car accident en route. Graham overpowers Macardo and makes away with the fetish. As he returns home and starts a fire in the basement to burn it, he trips and falls onto Charlie Boy and is killed after being impaled on one of the knives protruding from it.

Chuck and his wife Annie (Elaine Donnelly) are thrilled with the offer.

Martin runs shady experiments behind his store on captured wild animals to train them to become docile, thereby avoiding the need in future to cage them and make 'cageless' zoos. The animals are kept in open cages but the exits are electrified and the animals are conditioned to eat their food only after a bell is heard. If they fail to adhere to this, they are fatally electrocuted. Martin wants Chuck to manage the place for a few days while he is out of town. Chuck accepts but unfortunately greed gets the better of him again when he sees a large safe in the shop. Despite his wife's warnings, he tries to open it, only to fall through a trapdoor into a metal cell with no exit.

When Chuck doesn't come home, Annie goes to the pet shop but Martin says he hasn't seen him. She notices Chuck's coat at the store and immediately goes to the local police but they simply advise her to wait a while longer for his return before they act. Annie investigates the store at night and finds Chuck trapped in the cell, and runs to seek help. It is revealed that Martin is a former Nazi concentration camp official conducting bizarre experiments on human beings and animals and wanted to use Chuck as a human subject. Annie returns to help Chuck but is pushed into the cell by Martin, who closes the trapdoor. Martin observes the couple's activities and controls everything. The local police detective Aldrige (Anthony Carrick) visits the store but does not find anything. Martin finds the couple's house keys in Chuck's coat and visits their house.

As Chuck and Annie figure out what to do, an exit opens in the cell wall leading outside. However, it is electrified like all the other cages, by Martin to experiment and see if the captives will try to escape. They note that there are times when the electricity shuts off briefly. During one such moment, they rush through the exit and to freedom outside. Chuck goes back inside the store to confront Martin, but he finds that a black panther has managed to exit its cage and has cornered Martin who ends up falling into the cell himself via the trapdoor. The trapdoor closes, leaving Martin captive. Chuck and Annie return home, but on entering their house, the door shuts and the walls become electrified. Martin had wired the place during his visit and perhaps purposefully allowed them to escape as part of his experiments. The story ends with Chuck and Annie screaming for help from the outside, and Martin trapped in his own prison, with no one to hear his screams."

Mrs. Ardoy has a large family of children, some of whom are her stepchildren and some are fostered. She speaks about her husband often but he is never seen. All of the children are strange - they sleep at odd times, are afraid of fire, roam the woods in the dark, and become disoriented as dusk approaches. Framed pictures of various women in the house are also seen, apparently the mothers of the various children. Tom goes back to their car to collect some things, but is attacked by a half-human creature covered in fur with yellow eyes.

She has a voracious appetite for sex and eats only raw steaks. Tom confides to his colleague Harry about this and the preceding experiences, and Harry agrees with him that it is unlikely it was all a dream.

Weeks later, Sarah reveals she is eight weeks pregnant and the fetus is growing unnaturally rapidly. One day she leaves home and heads to the house in the Somerset woods.

However, as Tom discovers the woodcutter is Mr Ardoy, dusk approaches. Mr. Ardoy begins to change into a werewolf and kills Tom with his axe. At the house, Sarah dies during childbirth but Mrs. Ardoy and the other children welcome their new baby brother into their pack."

Penny tells him to leave but when he tries to rape her, she shoots him with a rifle. Harry returns home the following morning and Penny tells him what happened. She advises going to police but Harry refuses as his rifle was unlicensed and Penny may ""land back in the asylum"". He buries Charlie in the woods and disposes of Charlie's Range Rover into the lake nearby, and they remove all evidence of the incident. The local policeman arrives, saying that Charlie has been missing for two days, and is questioning Harry because of a disagreement the two of them had in a pub. However, Harry dodges the cop's inquiries efficiently.

Penny's mental problems have made her reliant on medication, but Harry rations her dosage. Soon, Penny starts seeing visions of the dead Charlie wherever she goes and believes he has come back from the grave. Harry and Penny seek help from a tarot card reader named Margaret (Mia Nardi) who summons Charlie's spirit and learns that he seeks revenge. Margaret says she is not strong enough to fight Charlie, but an Indian Swami named Gupta Krishna can do it. Desperate, Penny tells Margaret to bring Gupta from India, and that she will pay him £150,000 in order to start his ashram in the UK. The Swami arrives with Margaret at the couple's house for the seance. Charlie's spirit is summoned and is bent on revenge.

Edwin wakes up in the hospital, and is told by Harris and Dr. Manders that he had an attack of severe delusion of persecution, and now he is better as he has responded to medication. They decide to send him back to his old job as an operation theatre assistant. On radio Edwin learns of three nurses who have died by a yet undiagnosed viral infection of the brain in the country. Back home Edwin finds Stella, but is reminded of his mother and sees her body in the freezer, after which he again develops delusions.

In the end, while working in operation theatre, Edwin injects his scalp with local anesthetic and drills a hole in his skull to liberate the virus, and the story ends with surgeons operating on him just as they were operating on Dr Holt in the beginning for subdural hemorrhage, as Edwin says ""Leave my soul alone""."

While Nina is home alone, Ghostface impersonates Tyler and taunts Nina with video clips and text messages sent from Tyler's phone. Nina's relaxation in the hot tub is interrupted when Tyler's severed head is suddenly thrown into the pool. She screams and jumps out of the pool and hides behind a tree to try and call 911 with Siri, but the phone calls Pottery Barn instead. She runs to try and open the doors, when running to thr third door, Ghostface appears behind her and slashes her back causing her to scream. She then tries to run but falls in the process and is grabbed by Ghostface and has her thirst slit and is thrown in the pool. A close-up of her phone shows her mom is trying to call her and we see a close-up of Ghostface facing the camera before the title appears.

The next morning, Emma Duvall is studying with her boyfriend Will Belmont before having breakfast with her mother Maggie, who works as the coroner in the town of Lakewood. Emma teases her mother about Maggie's possible romantic connection to Sheriff Clark Hudson. At George Washington High School, Audrey commiserates with her friend Noah Foster about the ""Audrey's Face Suck Extravaganza"" video. Emma and Will discuss the video with their friends Brooke Maddox, Riley Marra, and Jake Fitzgerald. In Language Arts class, Emma and her friends take notice of new transfer student Kieran Wilcox, who recently moved to Lakewood. Ninas parents return home and discover their daughter's dead body in the pool.

Word of Ninas death makes it to school. One rumor regarding the killers identity suggests that Brandon James has returned to Lakewood. Serial killer history enthusiast Noah tells the story of how Brandon James, who had a caring older brother named Troy, was a teenager with Proteus syndrome who died 20 years earlier. Brandon had fallen in love with a girl named Daisy, but when she became frightened by his appearance following an unmasking at the school's Halloween dance, a group of drunken jocks beat him. Brandon then killed five students. Cops later shot Brandon during an arranged meeting with Daisy on the pier. Daisy is revealed to secretly be Emma's mother Maggie.

The students learn that Tyler is missing and is suspected in Nina's murder. Emma and Will discuss the situation with their friends. In an effort to renew their former friendship, Emma invites Audrey to the party Brooke is throwing as a memorial for Nina. Will and Jake have a tense confrontation with each other over a secret involvement they had with Nina. Language Arts teacher Seth Branson tries unsuccessfully to end his affair with Brooke. Back at home, Emma finds a package on her doorstep addressed to Daisy. Emma's mother plays coy about the name on the label. After Emma leaves with Will for Brooke's party, Maggie opens the package and finds a note that reads, ""Emma looks just like you at that age"" along with a bloody animal heart.

Because of the commotion surrounding her shaming video, Audrey's unexpected arrival at Brooke's party creates an initially awkward moment. Audrey and Emma later bond while having a poolside conversation. Riley takes an interest in Noah. Maggie calls Sheriff Clark Hudson about the anonymous package and reveals to him that Daisy was her family nickname. Maggie fears that a cycle of murders could be happening again. Clark promises to track down Emma's father Kevin. Noah continues discussing Brandon James, Nina's murder, and teenage horror tropes while partygoers drink around the fireplace. Brooke hints that Will and Nina had some sort of connection and Emma realizes that Will slept with Nina. After confronting Will, Emma walks off alone and finds Kieran in the greenhouse. Kieran explains the family circumstances that brought him to Lakewood. Kieran and Emma end up kissing.

Brooke investigates a light turning on in the garage, she finds one of car doors open. When she goes inside to get the key and close the door, she hears the sound of a knife and starts to run out the garage and runs into Will, who then threatens her to never come between he and Emma again. Having previously passed out, Noah regains consciousness to find himself stripped to his underwear and alone on the pier. Noah goes into the lake and is pulled under the water.

Kieran rescues Noah. Noah insists that someone grabbed him and pulled him beneath the waters surface. Kieran drives Emma home and the two of them see Sheriff Hudson speaking to Maggie in the doorway. Kieran reveals that the sheriff is his father. Ghostface stalks Audrey as she visits her girlfriend Rachel.

At school, Sheriff Hudson asks Noah to come to the station for questioning regarding Brandon James. Riley and Noah continue flirting with each other. Emma visits Audrey and admits that she was with Nina when the shaming video was recorded. Ghostface taunts Emma over the phone as she walks home. As Noah continues explaining tropes to Riley, Jake is revealed to have secret video of Nina on his computer, Audrey is revealed to have a picture of Brandon James unmasked, and Noah is seen hiding a bloody wound on his forehead."

When she answers, she unable to hear her clearly due to a bad connection, they talk about the video and how they have bitch fests at their schools because of it. When Audrey asks Rachael she wants company and she replies saying it's late, which makes Audrey say ""What if I'm already here."" After that, Rachael hears a noise outside and thinks it's Audrey joking around. After searching for her, she goes out to the balcony and finds rope tied to the balcony, after pulling it up from over the balcony, she discovers there's a noose at the end of the rope. Ghostface suddenly appears behind her and ties it around her neck while she tries to fight back. But she ends up getting thrown over the balcony and getting hanged by the noose, snapping her neck. Her foot twitches but goes still.

After the credits, the camera explores different parts of Lakewood as we hear Piper Shay's podcast talking about Nina's murder and how the investigation unfolds each day. She says it's been four days since her murder and Clark Hudson is still looking for Tyler. We then see Emma, who is listening to the podcast on her headphones as she makes her way to school. She is startled by Brooke (who's with Riley) and asks her why she's read her texts. When Emma ignores her, Brooke stops her and says she's sorry about what she said about Nina and Will at the party. Emma argues why she didn't tell her and Brooke says she was afraid of what Nina would do and admits she was afraid of her. Emma forgives her and three walk into school together. Along the way, Emma asks them if they've been getting any weird phone calls and Riley says it could be Jake as they enter the school.

At the police station, Clark is questioning Noah about Brandon James and his obsession with serial killers. Noah says he tried to message Brandon's brother to identify the mystery girl (Daisy/Maggie) he was in love with and none of his theories panned out. Clark finishes off by saying if he tried contacting Kevin Duvall, Noah says no. When Noah is getting ready to leave, Kieran walks in and Noah thanks him for saving his life back at the lake. Kieran says ""No problem"" and Noah leaves. Kieran asks Clark for the house key and while getting it, Clark asks him what Noah was talking about. Kieran tells him some jocks left him in the middle of the lake and he saved him. When Clark asks who they were, Kieran says he's not a 21 Jump Street snitch and leaves.

At the school parking lot, Jake thanks Will for the lift and Will talks about Emma and how she won't talk to Will. He suggests a heartfelt apology and Jake says ""Hell yes!"" and they start to walk.They stop halfway and Will asks Jake if he deleted the files, and he says yes. Will starts to walk alone, when Jake starts to follow, he notices a trail of red paint behind his car that leads around the side, he follows it and discovers someone had wrote ""Doosh"" (douche) of the side of his car.

Outside the school, Noah and Audrey are at the memorial made for Nina. Noah notices Piper talking to a teacher, she finishes the conversation and walks over towards them and introduces herself. Noah says he's a big fan of hers and her work is addictive, she thanks him. Piper asks them both that she wants to know the real Nina. Audrey says ""Nina was a stone cold bitch who got what she deserved."" Piper asks her if she can quote her on that, but Noah says no. When Piper asks his opinion on her, he is about to saying something until Jake shouts from afar that someone's ass is toast. Noah pulls Audrey as they try to walk away. But Jake catches up to him and slams him against a wooden column telling him about his car and how it went viral and asks if he did it, Jake says he's dead if he finds out his lying. Jake gives him a small slap on the cheek before walking away. Audrey talks to Noah about his choice of spelling douche and Noah replies saying he should of used spray paint instead of paint.

In the school hallway, Riley says to Emma she doesn't care what the press thinks about Tyler saying he's not a psycho and Emma agrees by saying ""If he's innocent, why doesn't he come forward."" Riley says she doesn't know and thinks he might be afraid, Will then walks over to them and asks Emma if she got his texts, Riley says ""Good luck"" and goes to her locker. As Emma walks to her locker, she says she did get his texts and Will says he wants a chance to explain himself by saying Nina came on to him because she felt threatened by Emma. As they continue to talk about the situation, Kieran walks over to them and says ""That's my locker and I'm pretty sure Emma's done talking to you."" As they stare at each other, Emma asks if they want duelling pistols, making Will walk away and shoving into Kieran along the way. Emma and Kieran talk for a bit and he leaves. Audrey walks into the hallway and to her locker. Emma walks over and asks if they can talk. Audrey says ""What is there to say?"" They argue about the video and how Emma should of stop Nina filming it and how she feels guilty because of it. Emma asks they can move on from it and Audrey asks why. Soon, they receive a text message with the words ""Payback's a BITCH"" along with a GIF of The Killer facing the camera with Nina's dead body face down in the pool in the background. Soon every student receives the message and Emma is shocked to see its the Brandon James mask.

At the police station, Mayor Quinn and Clark are walking into Clark's offices whilst discussing that the last thing people need to see is the mask and Clark says he has a tech guy solving it. They run into Maggie who joins the discussion of Tyler being the main suspect. Quinn leaves and Clark asks Maggie if she is OK and says he'll protect her. Clark suddenly receives a new case as Maggie a text and discover they have to go to the same place and aren't happy with what they read.

Outside the school, Riley is seen texting and Noah runs up to her and they chat about the GIF and what they're doing for their doing for their pre-term projects. Noah says he doing an app that links to any downtime satellite away that lets you tool around the universe from any mobile device, Riley jokes that you can just go outside, lay down on the grass and look up. She says he should do it sometime, implying a date. Noah is speechless and laughs, Riley says she'll see him in class and walks away. He tells himself he has no game has as the school bell rings.

In Mr. Brandon's room, he tells everyone to put their phones down and they should focus more on their studies than Lakewood's web buzz. Jake says ""Who could resist a murder selfie?"" which makes Noah say a monologue about how murder is a lonely game and how we share the things we do, as he is saying his monologue, Riley receives and goes to read, Mr. Branson catches her. She apologises and says that her friend from St. Mary's texted that girl who goes there died. Everyone is shocked, especially Audrey who checks her phone. When Mr. Branson is in the middle of saying they should get to what they're doing, Audrey gets out of the chair and runs to the door saying she needs to go to the bathroom. Emma then follows her.

In the school hallway, Emma leaves the classroom and finds Audrey leaning over a locker, when Emma goes to comfort her, she pushes her hand away and appears in tears. She says, she called Rachel to check up on her and her mom called, she told her they found her hanging from her ceiling fan, thinking she committed suicide. Audrey then walks away in tears, leaving Emma saddened. We then see Maggie at the crime scene taking photographs of Rachel hanging from the ceiling fan.

Audrey is then seen waiting outside the principal's office, Noah sits beside her and tells him her father is picking her up. Noah says he's sorry and puts his arm around her as she leans on his shoulder. In the school hallway, Brooke says her friend from St. Mary's said Rachel was a train wreck and Emma says she killed herself because of her, Riley tells her not to blame herself as they were all there with Nina during the filming. Emma still blames herself as she was with Nina in the parking lot and let it (Nina's filming Audrey and Rachel) happen and she then walks away.

Emma then walks into the girls bathroom and is about to cry until she hears two girls saying whoever posted the video has more blood on their hands and they've got a new Nina.

At the Grindhouse, Emma is seen working and when taking Piper's plate, she says she recognizes her voice and Piper introduces herself. That night, Emma takes out the trash, she hears a noise and when she turns round, a figure dressed in black with their hood up is seen sitting on the ground. The door suddenly shuts and the figure is gone. When she starts to walk towards where the figure was, they stand up from behind a dumpster, Emma grabs a 2x4 board and starts to run, almost hitting Will. She asks what he's doing there and he says he got her text, which she didn't send. Inside, they think Brooke sent the text, Will apologizes about Nina, Emma confesses to kissing Kieran at the party. Will says it'll be great if she shows up at his game the next day, she says she'll try.

At the morgue, Maggie is examining Rachel's body when Emma walks in and learns Rachel was a cutter and had issues. Emma starts to tear up when she tells her mother about how she was there when Nina filmed Audrey and Rachel and how she think she caused what's happening before leaving.

In the library, Audrey is looking at photos and videos of Rachel. Back at the morgue, Maggie and Clark are discussing Rachel's death, Maggie says her neck snapped which wouldn't be possible if she was found hanging on her ceiling fan. They both start to suspect she didn't commit suicide. Maggie then talks about Emma saying she could of stopped the video."

She's covered with rose petals and has sunflowers over her eyes. We then cut to a party where a woman introduces the ""Master of the Macabre,"" Richard Castle, who has just released Storm Fall, the conclusion to his bestselling Derek Storm series. He laps up the attention, posing for pictures and signing autographs. Meanwhile, back at the dead woman's apartment, the police have arrived. The lead detective, Kate Beckett, is told that the victim is Allison Tisdale, a twenty-four-year old social worker. She was shot twice in the chest before being posed and Beckett realizes that she has seen this scene before; it's straight out of a Richard Castle novel, ""Flowers For Your Grave.""

Back at the party, Castle talks to his publisher (and ex-wife), the woman who introduced him before. She wants to know why he killed off Derek Storm. He says it's because writing Derek Storm isn't fun anymore but he can still write bestsellers. His publisher claims that she was told he hasn't written anything in months and that if she doesn't get a new manuscript within the next few weeks, the company will demand the return of his advance. Castle counters that he already returned it divorcing her. At the bar, his daughter, Alexis, is doing homework while his mother, Martha, orders a drink. Castle tells her to stop discussing his work with his publisher before she goes to flirt with an older gentleman. He then tells his daughter that he should be committed for allowing her to move in with them. When she complains that he shouldn't talk like that in front of her, Castle tells her she should go out and have some fun so she can have stories she can't tell her children. He goes on to talk about why he killed Derek, how bored he is with him and with the same old people and questions at the parties. He says that just once, he wants someone to come up and say something new. Detective Beckett then comes up and says she needs to ask him a few questions.

At the police station, Beckett interrogates Castle, citing his rap sheet (he once stole a police horse while nude). The charges were dropped because of his friendship with the Mayor. He tries to charm his way out, but Beckett doesn't respond. She shows him a picture of Allison Tisdale; Castle doesn't recognize her. She then shows him pictures of Martin Fisk, a lawyer who is also dead. Castle doesn't recognize him either. She then shows him pictures of the two crime scenes. Castle recognizes the scene as being from ""Flowers For Your Grave"" and Beckett says that Martin Fisk's body was found in a scene out of his book ""Hell Hath No Fury."" Castle says that Beckett must be a pretty big fan of his, commenting that only hard-core fans read those books. Beckett, flustered, asks if those fans ever write him any disturbing letters, saying that sometimes killers try to contact the object of their obsession. Castle mentions he already knows this as being familiar with psychopaths is an occupational hazard. He gives her permission to go through his fan mail before asking if he can have copies of the pictures, because having a copycat will make the other authors in his poker group jealous.

At home, Martha is singing and dancing to piano accompaniment while Alexis is in the kitchen doing homework wearing earplugs. Alexis asks him if he's in trouble, but Castle assures her that the police only want his help on a case. They discuss the two murders before they go to bed. In the morning, at the station, Beckett comes in with a box full of Castle's books. She gives them to two other detectives, Ryan and Esposito, to read so they will recognize any other copycat murder scenes. The books belong to Beckett and Ryan and Esposito tease for being such a fan. She later tells Esposito that she reads them because she's curious about how people can do these things to each other. Castle arrives, offering his help in the investigation. They go through his fan mail together in an interrogation room where Castle flirts a little with Beckett. She asks if he's there to annoy her. He says he wants to know why those people were murdered like that. That there is always a story that makes everything make sense. He points out that people like Bennett do not usually become cops. He reasons that something must have happened to someone she cared about and guesses that the case was never solved. Beckett, upset about how close his observations were, is silent and sad before finding a letter in which someone has drawn a picture that looks exactly like Allison Tisdale's murder.

Back at her desk, Beckett says that the lab got prints off of the letter but they don't know whose because the system is backlogged and it will take a week to find out. Castle promptly calls the Mayor and says that they will get their prints in an hour. As Beckett begins to chew him out for jumping the line, they get a call that there's been another murder. A girl, Kendra Pitney, is floating face-down in a pool in a prom dress with a knife in her back. They pull her out of the water and Castle, ignoring Beckett's orders to stay put, goes to talk to the Lanie, the Medical Examiner. She reveals that the girl was killed elsewhere and posed before Beckett drags Castle away to tell him that she expects him to obey her orders. He points out that if the killer was following his books, the dress should be blue. He asks if they've found a connection between the victims or a motive, but Beckett says that since they're dealing with a serial killer, it doesn't matter. She then gets a call that the fingerprints belong to a Kyle Cabot.

They pull up to his apartment and break down the door. Inside, they find newspaper articles about the killings along with drawings, letters, and Castle's books. In another room, the walls are covered with book covers, photos, and articles about Castle, which he finds to be creepy (he has once again ignored Beckett's order to stay put). Esposito finds Allison's blouse and the handgun that probably killed her. Kyle Cabot is found in a closet beating his head against the wall. In an interrogation room, he refuses to speak and Beckett says that he has Pervasive Developmental Disorder and that his caseworker was Allison Tisdale. Castle is not sure that Kyle is the killer as it makes for a poor story. Later that night, Beckett goes over the case while Castle plays poker with three author buddies. He is preoccupied thinking about the case, discussing it with the others as if it is a story he's working on. They, too, are dissatisfied with the ending, saying that the ""story"" needs a character that works to prove Kyle is innocent.

In the morning, Beckett catches Castle going through the files on her desk. He apologizes before giving her a gift and leaving. She starts to go about her day before becoming suspicious and realizing that he took the files related to the case. She finds him at the library and arrests him. As he's being led away, he calls back that the rose petals Allison was covered with were different than the ones in his book and that she should make a note of it since it means Kyle Cabot is innocent. Back at the station, Martha and Alexis are there to take him home. Captain Montgomery has agreed to drop the charges as long as Castle promises not to interfere in the case. Castle still insists that Kyle is innocent, though. This gets to Beckett and she goes back over the case, eventually coming to the same conclusion as Castle. He discusses the case with Martha and Alexis on the way home. He reasons that since Allison was the only one who knew anything about Kyle, she must have been the one the real killer wanted dead.

Castle goes to see Allison's father, arriving at the same time as Beckett. Allison's father says that she had no enemies, was not wealthy, but stood to inherit part of her father's estate when he died. Outside, Castle informs Beckett that Tisdale is dying; he was wearing make-up, was sickly thin, and was wearing a toupee. They go to interview Harrison Tisdale, Allison's brother. He says that she wanted to see the best in people and even tried to get Kyle Cabot a job at his company. Beckett gets him to admit that his father is dying and asks him where he was on the day of his sister's murder. He says he was out of the country for all three murders and shows them his passport. Back at the station, Ryan says that Harrison purchased three tickets out of the country that match up with the dates of the murders. Castle suggests that Harrison bought a second passport. Beckett orders Ryan and Esposito to keep an eye on Harrison and goes to get a search warrant for Harrison's home and office. Meanwhile, Harrison has gone home to shred the evidence.

When the police arrive, they tell Becket that Harrison's business is going under; that's his motive for murder. Before going in, she handcuffs Castle to the car to make sure he stays put this time. As soon as she's gone, he pulls a handcuff key out of his pocket only to drop it on the ground. Harrison puts the remaining evidence in a garbage bag and runs down the fire escape. Meanwhile, Castle sees Harrison coming down the fire escape, finally gets free, and calls Beckett to tell her about Harrison before running after him himself. Beckett runs after both of them, but by the time she catches up, Harrison has taken Castle hostage. Castle guesses that when Harrison asked his father for money, he refused, so he took revenge on his father by taking away Allison, the only thing he had ever loved. Castle then decks him and takes his gun. Beckett cuffs him and takes him away. When everything is over, Castle offers to take her out but she turns him down and walks away. He goes home and works on his new manuscript. The next day, Beckett gets called into Captain Montgomery's office. He tells her the Mayor called and that Castle has decided to base a character in a new series of books on her but needs to do research. She protests but the Mayor is okay with it and Montgomery agrees. How long the partnership lasts is up to Castle."

When a second victim, a non-Black woman lawyer, is found dead by the same ritual, the case takes a more complicated turn. Beckett uncovers that the murder victim was a Nigerian student who had been working for a notorious Nigerian slumlord and businessman who has gone missing.

With her mother Joy (CYNTHIA STEVENSON) insisting that she get a job, George applies to a temp agency that sends her out as a file clerk. Her lunch break - and her life - are cut short when a toilet seat from the MIR space station drives her into the pavement.

Rube takes George under his wing and introduces her to the other members of his undead group: Mason (CALLUM BLUE), Roxy (JASMINE GUY) and Betty (REBECCA GAYHEART).

They look just like everyone else but as grim reapers they appear physically different to the living than they did when they were alive.

What George experiences beyond death is the focus of this darkly comedic series. It takes a slightly twisted look at life and at one possible version of life in the after life.

[IMDB insists a synopsis must be 10 lines long, even for a five minute cartoon for pre-school kids. I believe my synopsis above to be complete, accurate, and sufficient. In fact, it's probably nearly as long as the script. Therefore I'm adding this text both to satisfy IMDB's automated checking, and also for anyone (including IMDB staff) who review the synopsis. I understand why you have the automated checking there, and it probably applies in most cases, but perhaps you could switch it off when the duration of an episode is five minutes.

She is there to research alchemy and its place in the history of science, taking advantage of the resources at the Bodleian Library. Diana's friend and fellow witch, Gillian, invites her to the local coven's equinox celebration, but Diana declines, having distanced herself from that part of her heritage. At the Bodleian, Diana requests several Ashmole manuscripts. The archivist can't find one of them at first glance, but when she passes the shelf again, Ashmole 782 is there.

Diana can tell something is unusual about the book as soon as she opens it. First, she observes that three pages have been cut out. An illustration of the alchemical child intrigues her. There is barely discernible text below it, and as Diana examines it further she sees it moving and changing. Touching the page causes the text to spread to her hand. Alarmed, she puts her hand on the illustration, which burns its image into her palm. She returns the book and runs from the library, seeing a vision of her father as she leaves.

Across town, two vampires react to the opening of the book: Matthew Clairmont, professor of biochemistry, and Miriam Shephard, his lab manager. Gillian observed Diana's reaction in the library and asks her about it, but Diana is still distressed and doesn't answer. Gillian later reports the incident to her coven leader, Sylvia, after receiving a text asking members if they felt anything strange the day of the equinox. Diana dreams about the book, spiders, and a web that envelops her whole body. She calls her aunt Sarah to tell her about the book and her vision. Sarah reacts combatively, but her partner Emily is more understanding of Diana's discomfort with magic.

Marcus Whitmore, a vampire and medical doctor, sees one of his colleagues hit by a car. He attempts to save him by turning him into a vampire, but the siring process fails. After making a police report, Marcus is picked up by Matthew, who takes him to the lab and asks Miriam to run tests. The three vampires discuss the possibility that Ashmole 782, a book Matthew has sought for hundreds of years, has been found.

The next time she is at the library, Diana accidentally uses magic to retrieve a book from a high shelf. Matthew catches it as it sails through the air. He introduces himself and praises Diana's writing, claiming he recognized her from the author photo in her books. In fact, he overheard Gillian's questioning of Diana after she ran from the library and researched her identity. Diana attempts to learn more about Matthew and finds to her annoyance that he keeps showing up wherever she goes. He warns her that other supernatural creatures are interested in Ashmole 782 and she won't be able to avoid notice.

After a long day of research, Diana goes out for drinks with Sean, a library employee. She reveals that her parents were killed when she was young, on suspicion of being witches, and that she was raised by Sarah and Emily. Sean doesn't realize that supernatural creatures exist and scoffs at people who still believe in witchcraft.

In Finland, two men approach a remote cottage. A witch, Satu, emerges and uses her powers to kill one of them. It is then revealed she knows the other man, Peter Knox, who hired a local huntsman to test Satu for suitability to join the Congregation. The two of them later visit Oxford at Sylvia's invitation to question Gillian about what she observed.

While Diana is out of her apartment, Matthew searches it for the missing book. He then tracks her down to the boathouse as she returns from rowing. She insists she no longer has the book, and that he should leave her alone. He picks up the jacket she drops and is compelled to breathe in her scent. As his vampire instincts kick in, he warns her to walk away from him, but not to run."

She follows them and lures Matthieu away, sexually engaging with him and then feeding on him.

Matthew drives to the Scottish highlands to hunt on the estate of his friend Hamish Osborne, a daemon. He tells Hamish about Diana, whom he is craving, and the appearance of Ashmole 782. The book is known to daemons as well, and Hamish hopes that discovering its secrets will help his kind understand their origins and push back against their lack of status relative to vampires and witches.

Diana awakens from another dream involving webs and spiders. She finds that Matthew has returned her jacket to the mailbox outside her building. The Bodleian is crowded with supernatural creatures, as Matthew warned her. Peter Knox approaches her there, saying he was friends with her mother. He invites her to tea and interrogates her about Ashmole 782, which he has tried and failed to retrieve. Diana finds his arrogance and bigotry toward vampires distasteful and leaves, prompting Knox to tell Satu they may need to use ""firmer tactics"". Satu later approaches Diana while she is running and attempts to detect her magic, but finds her shielded in some way.

Domenico Michele, a vampire, visits the morgue in Venice to investigate the body of Matthieu, found completely drained of blood. He detects Juliette's scent and pays a visit to her vampire sire, Gerbert d'Aurillac. Gerbert feeds on Juliette to read her memories and confirms that she was responsible, and that her obsession with Matthew Clairmont is what drove her to it. He imprisons her at their home, as she cries out in protest that he was the one who made her crave Matthew.

Diana confides in Gillian, who tries to convince her to cooperate with Knox. She then calls Emily, who confirms her suspicions that Knox is not trustworthy. At a faculty party that evening, Knox corners Diana again and projects his voice into her mind. She responds with a burst of power that shatters a window. She then discovers Gillian's betrayal and seeks out Matthew at his apartment, just as he returns to Oxford.

Matthew tries to calm Diana down, as her rapid, adrenaline-fueled heartbeat causes him distress. He shows her an inscribed copy of Darwin's On the Origin of Species, engaging her interest as a historian. They visit Matthew's lab, where Diana meets Miriam and Marcus and learns the purpose of their research. By examining the DNA of creatures, they hope to understand why vampires are failing to sire, daemons are suffering from an increase in mental illness, and witches' powers have faded significantly over the generations. Matthew walks Diana back to her apartment, and she shares with him the few details she was able to observe about Ashmole 782. Matthew thanks her, kissing her on the inside of her wrist."

Gillian appears, wanting to explain her involvement with Knox, but her disgust toward Matthew angers Diana further and she leaves with him in his car. They drive to Matthew's estate, where he shares some of his vast library with her. He also tests Diana by trying to spill wine on a rare book she is reading. Diana magically moves it out of harm's way and Matthew concludes that her powers are instinctive. He tells her something of his family and reveals he is over 1500 years old. As they depart, Diana asks Matthew to have dinner with her the following day.

Satu rides a boat to the meeting place of the Congregation, which is shielded from outside view by magic. The human administrator, Rico, explains his hereditary role and guides her to the witches' archives. Satu seeks out Diana's file and finds some records heavily redacted. She uses magic to remove the redaction, but Domenico intrudes before she can read further.

Emily casts a crying spell to check on Diana, but her concentration is disturbed by the cat. She tells Sarah she saw a man in the shadows, following Diana. Sarah concludes that this is a vampire and later calls Diana, demanding to know about him. Emily reminds Diana that her mother used to tell stories about a ""shadow prince"". Diana dismisses their concerns.

Sophie Norman, a pregnant daemon, is working at a shop, drawing something that looks like the illustration in Ashmole 782. She returns home to her daemon husband, Nathaniel Wilson, carrying several books on alchemy. He is monitoring an online chat room he created for daemons, hoping their kind can reach out to each other and share their experiences.

Diana goes shopping and discovers that Marcus is following her at Matthew's request while he is at a conference. She enlists his help planning a menu for Matthew, and in return he convinces her to donate blood to their research project. Matthew enters the lab before Marcus can draw her blood and insists on doing it himself. Miriam is observing Matthew and later confronts him on his way to Diana's apartment. She can tell Matthew craves Diana and reminds him of something called the Covenant.

Domenico tells Gerbert what he learned from Satu, that Matthew is pursuing a witch named Diana Bishop. He suggests someone visit Oxford to observe and gather information they can use against Matthew's family. Gerbert opens a box that holds the masked head of a woman. He awakens her with his blood and she speaks a prophecy: Beware the witch with the blood of the lion and the wolf. Gerbert later frees Juliette for the purpose of sending her to Oxford.

Nathaniel's mother Agatha visits her son and daughter-in-law. Nathaniel tells her the Congregation is forcing the daemon chat room to shut down. Agatha is head of the daemon delegation and denies having said anything, but cautions Nathaniel not to break the rules. Creatures are supposed to avoid gathering in numbers that would attract human notice. Since daemons are the most social of creatures, isolation is exacerbating their tendency toward mental illness. Sophie shows Agatha a statue that her family has passed down through generations, which reminds her of the alchemical white queen. Her father had told her she should give it to the person who needs it when the time comes.

Diana answers a knock at her door but finds Knox instead of Matthew. He warns her against shunning her own kind and remarks that she is too open-minded, just like her father. Matthew's arrival drives Knox away. He impresses Diana with how much he can detect in the taste and smell of food and wine. When she innocently asks what she would taste like, he becomes angry; he is hardly able to control himself around her as it is. She kisses him, but he does not reciprocate and leaves immediately afterward.

Diana wakes up the next morning to find an envelope slid under her door. It contains graphic photos from the site of her parents' murder. She confronts Gillian, knowing that Knox is responsible and blaming her for feeding him information. Matthew visits Diana's apartment, but she is on her way to the Bodleian. However, the door has been left ajar and Matthew finds the photos. Diana requests Ashmole 782 from Sean. He tells her people have been asking for it all week but it has gone missing since she returned it. Knox arrives, backed up by other witches, and orders Sean to get the book. Sean demands they leave and Knox attacks him with magic. Diana summons a powerful wind but quickly loses control. Matthew senses her need and rushes to the library to calm her down.

Marcus finds Matthew at Diana's apartment, reports that Sean is fine, and expresses awe that Diana has the power of witch wind. Diana is sound asleep and Matthew is packing a suitcase. Marcus pleads with him not to endanger ""our family"" by striking back at Knox. When Diana wakes up, Matthew tells her he is taking her away from Oxford to his family home in France. They kiss."

Diana also meets Marthe, the de Clermont family's longtime housekeeper, who is much warmer toward her.

Marcus is surprised to find Juliette at Matthew's apartment. She attacks him, but Miriam appears and drives her away, taunting her for her obsession with Matthew.

Matthew finds Philippe's former office locked; Ysabeau doesn't want it open while a witch is present. Nevertheless, she gives Matthew the key. Diana sees her mother in a dream. She receives a call from Sarah and Emily and lets them know her location. They warn her that Ysabeau is infamous for killing witches, having wiped out entire covens after Philippe's death. Matthew reviews the photos sent to Diana, discovering that they were staged and that her parents were killed by fellow witches.

The Congregation gathers for an emergency meeting where Knox accuses Matthew of kidnapping Diana. Baldwin, head of the vampire delegation and brother to Matthew, is caught unawares and calls Marcus, who is revealed to be Matthew's son. Marcus tells Baldwin about Diana's involvement in the summoning of Ashmole 782, also referred to as the Book of Life. Baldwin reveals this information to the Congregation, diverting attention from Matthew for the moment. Satu speaks out of turn, revealing to Knox that she has read Diana's file. He punishes her later in the witches' archives with a magical object that immobilizes her. Agatha calls Sophie for more details about her alchemist studies, and Sophie describes visions that conclusively point toward Diana. Agatha refrains from sharing Diana's identity, however, and simply warns Sophie against getting involved.

Matthew and Diana go horseback riding, with Diana on Ysabeau's horse, Rakasa. Marthe and Ysabeau discuss the power they sense in Diana. Later, Matthew tells Diana the truth about her parents' death. This presents an opportunity for Diana to reach out to Ysabeau, who finally reveals a chink in her armor. She advises Diana to make the perpetrators pay as Ysabeau did with Philippe's tormentors. After dinner, Matthew dances with his mother and then with Diana, who glows with power.

Gillian speaks with Sylvia after a coven meeting. Sylvia has learned from Knox that Diana is at Sept-Tours and expresses a need for more information on Matthew's research.

Domenico arrives at Sept-Tours with a demand from the Congregation that Diana turn over the Book of Life. He also sees that Matthew and Diana have grown close and accuses them of breaking the Covenant, a rule which forbids inter-species relationships. After forcing Domenico to leave, Matthew asserts that the Congregation will not disturb them further because the Covenant will not be broken. Diana insists they are bound together and tells Matthew she loves him. He declines to answer and departs for Oxford after Miriam calls to report a break-in at the lab. Diana's tears manifest witch water, another powerful elemental force that amazes Ysabeau and Marthe."

Matthew investigates the lab and recognizes the scent of the intruder. After he leaves, Miriam insists they call Baldwin and tell him Matthew's judgment is severely compromised because of Diana.

Matthew tracks down Gillian and feeds on her, reading her memories of what she saw in the lab. He also takes her phone, which contains photo evidence, and leaves her in the street. Gillian manages to reach Sylvia's doorstep before passing out. Sigismund, the third witch on the Congregation, relays this information to Knox and Satu. They have differing opinions on whether Gillian was right to trespass on vampire territory, but they are all equally concerned that Matthew is studying witch DNA.

Back at Sept-Tours, Ysabeau takes Diana hunting to show her what vampires must do to survive, trying to discourage her from pursuing Matthew. Diana remains strong. She calls Sarah and Emily to ask about the Covenant, and she confesses her love for Matthew. Next, Ysabeau takes Diana into the adjacent town and shows her the church Matthew built during his human life. Inside are the graves of Bianca and Lucas, Matthew's wife and young son who died from a fever. Ysabeau found Matthew fatally injured at the base of the church tower, possibly after a suicide attempt, and sired him in the church. Ysabeau does not think Matthew will ever mate, because he can never have another child. Diana insists she will never leave Matthew regardless.

Matthew visits Hamish, who sees that he is deeply conflicted in his feelings toward Diana. He realizes his friend is more worried that Diana will discover his darkest secrets than he is about the Congregation. Hamish tells him love can't be controlled and he should let nothing stand in his way.

At the next Congregation meeting, everyone argues about who has the right to retrieve Diana from Sept-Tours. Baldwin insists that it is his responsibility alone. Satu asks Knox if he would consider siding with the other vampires against Baldwin, in order to capture Diana for further study. What she has in mind, an opening spell, is dangerous dark magic and Knox warns her against it. He also tells her in the strongest terms that she must avoid Gerbert, who is rumored to have kept a witch in thrall for centuries.

Nathaniel has kept up his daemon outreach and is meeting with a group at a local pub. Sophie comes in late and tells Nathaniel she heard her father's voice in a dream, repeating that she must tell the truth. She has a secret she wants to share with Agatha, and while Nathaniel is wary, he ultimately supports her decision.

Diana is sitting at Matthew's desk and discovers a hidden latch, triggering the opening of a drawer that contains seals and badges belonging to the Knights of Lazarus. Matthew calls her from Oxford and they have a strained conversation. Thinking of Diana compels Matthew to re-examine her DNA results and he makes a surprising discovery in the lab. Miriam finds him there the next morning and is equally excited by the data.

Marthe wakes Diana to tell her Matthew is on the way, and she runs to meet him. Matthew declares his love for her and performs the vampire equivalent of a marriage vow. He expects Ysabeau to send them away, but she accepts Diana as her daughter and vows to take up their fight. She praises Diana's courage, but privately she confides in Marthe that Diana's lack of magical control puts them all at risk.

Gerbert consults his captive witch again. She elaborates on the prophecy she gave earlier: Beware the witch with the blood of the lion and the wolf, for with it she will destroy the children of the night. Gerbert demands more information. She will only reveal that there are two candidates to fulfill the prophecy, one light and one dark, and one is close. At that very moment, Satu arrives at Gerbert's home. Domenico later finds Juliette at a club and baits her with news of Matthew and Diana, encouraging her to go to Sept-Tours.

Matthew shares the DNA results with Diana, revealing that she expresses every genetic marker they have discovered in witches. If such a powerful witch can still be born, perhaps creatures are not doomed to extinction after all. He starts to tell her about Gillian, but she has other things on her mind. Matthew carries her to his bedroom. He is reluctant for her to see his many scars; she wants to hunt down everyone who hurt him. They engage in the practice of ""bundling"", an old European wedding tradition that is apparently more intimate in France. Diana wakes before Matthew the next morning and goes for a run, but she is suddenly grabbed from the air by an unseen person."

Diana tries to run but is cut off by Gerbert. Satu has promised him access to Diana once she is finished but demands he retreat for now.

Satu alternates between offering to teach Diana and mocking her lack of control. She tells Diana that Matthew brutally killed Gillian, and that her parents would be ashamed that she betrayed her kind for a vampire. Diana replies that she was the one who was betrayed, because witches killed her parents. Satu accuses her of lying, but doubt shows on her face.

Matthew awakens to find Diana gone from the bedroom. He soon realizes he can't sense her anywhere in Sept-Tours. Meanwhile, Emily casts a crying spell and is overcome by a feeling that Diana is in pain.

Satu uses a ritual drum to call the elements, then begins torturing Diana by repeatedly lifting and dropping her, finally suspending her upside-down. She summons a circle of fire and uses dark magic to burn Diana's flesh. But just as Knox warned her, the opening spell takes a heavy toll and she loses consciousness.

Baldwin arrives at Sept-Tours by helicopter and Matthew immediately accuses the Congregation of taking Diana. They fight, with Matthew subduing Baldwin by biting him. Marthe interrupts with the news that she caught Diana's scent in the garden, mixed with another. Matthew find the end of Diana's trail and they conclude that a witch is responsible. Baldwin calls Knox, who conceals his surprise and lies that Satu is with him.

Satu awakens next to Diana, drags her inside the ruin, and throws her down a well. As Satu screams in anger, Gerbert's captive witch echoes her screams. Gerbert orders Satu to retrieve Diana, but she tells him her power is gone.

As the de Clermonts plan their search, Marthe tells Matthew that even the most powerful witch could not have flown far while carrying another. Diana's phone rings, and Matthew answers the call from Sarah. Details from Emily's vision combined with Ysabeau's knowledge leads them to La Pierre, a castle once owned by Gerbert. Matthew and Baldwin depart in the helicopter.

Diana regains consciousness at the bottom of the well. She experiences a vision of her parents mixed with a memory of one of their stories about the shadow prince. In it, Diana is trapped in a dark place with a window high above. The prince can't fly down to her, so she has to rescue herself.

Gerbert shows Satu the witch's head, threatening her with the same fate. He flees as soon as he hears the helicopter, locking the door behind him and leaving Satu trapped. Satu senses the power in the witch and requests her help to free them both. The witch transfers enough magic to unlock the door, and Satu escapes with the box.

Matthew calls for Diana and hears her voice from the well. Baldwin stops him from jumping in, which would achieve nothing. Diana hears her parents' voices again and her full power is finally released, allowing her to fly free. They return to Sept-Tours, where Matthew tends to Diana's injuries with the help of Marthe and Ysabeau. They discover that Satu has burned Matthew's insignia into Diana's back, marking her as vampire property. Diana asks Matthew whether he killed Gillian; he says he didn't, but wishes he had. She asks for his promise that he will leave Satu to her.

Gerbert returns to La Pierre and finds Satu's ritual drum. He tastes the blood on it and discovers something that makes him smile.

Baldwin tells Matthew he is taking Diana to the Congregation and threatens to disown Matthew if he tries to stop him. Matthew invokes his greater loyalty to the Knights of Lazarus, an order formed by Philippe in which Matthew outranks Baldwin. Baldwin has no choice but to follow Matthew's command. He leaves Sept-Tours, warning Diana and Matthew that he can only stall the Congregation for so long.

Satu speaks to the captive witch and learns her name, Meridiana. She removes the mask and promises she will go to the other side as only herself, not what Gerbert made of her. Meridiana repeats her prophecy, which disturbs Satu, as do the witch's dying words: Thank you, Weaver.

Agatha meets with Nathaniel and Sophie. Sophie reveals that her parents were witches, and she believes her unborn child is one as well. They kept this from Agatha, fearing the Congregation's rules about species mixing, but Sophie now feels it is urgent that she meet the witch from her visions. Agatha promises she will always put her family over her duty to the Congregation, and she reveals Diana's identity.

Diana expresses a feeling of liberation. Matthew and Ysabeau have been discussing how her magic was finally freed, and raise the possibility that she was spellbound. Diana has only heard of this being performed on witches who posed great danger to others, and wonders aloud what she might have done."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7886962/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,Diana's aunts' home gives up all sorts of secrets when Diana and Matthew pay a visit. Danger looms as Juliette breaks free from Gerbert.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Sarah Walker'],"['', '']",[],"['alchemy', 'witchcraft', 'oxford', 'demon', 'blood', 'mythology', 'time travel', 'sorcery', 'folklore', 'triple f rated', 'haunted house', 'venice italy']",[],"Matthew and Diana depart Sept-Tours for Madison, New York. Sarah and Emily have stepped out to give the house time to get used to Matthew. It is haunted and doesn't always react well to new people.

Baldwin tells the Congregation that Satu still has Diana and throws additional suspicion on the absent Gerbert. He sends Domenico to find him and tells the others to tend to their own until the witches are located.

When Sarah and Emily return home, Diana confronts them about being spellbound. Sarah is shocked, but Emily confesses that she figured it out and kept it secret. It was Diana's parents who hid her powers to protect her from the Congregation. The house proceeds to show them the circumstances leading up to Rebecca and Stephen's death.

Diana was younger than the usual age for a witch to be tested, but Knox was convinced she had great power, like her mother, and would not leave them alone. Stephen performed the binding spell while Rebecca told Diana a story about ""magic ribbons"" that would protect her from jealous witches until she grew up and met the shadow prince. When Knox tested Diana, he could not detect her power. Part of the reason Rebecca and Stephen left soon afterward was to draw any suspicion the Congregation still had onto them and not their daughter.

Diana experiences the loss of her parents all over again and runs into the woods, finding her mother's initials carved into an old tree. Matthew follows her and they discuss how Diana's powers were tied not only to need, but to Matthew specifically. Somehow her parents knew he and Diana were destined for each other. They kiss, and Diana sees a vision of Rebecca looking on approvingly. Meanwhile, Emily comforts Sarah, who is devastated that her sister didn't trust her.

Knox awakens to find Satu in his room, holding the magic object he once used against her. She accuses him of killing Rebecca and Stephen, realizing he warned her about the opening spell because he had cast it himself. He was looking for the great power he sensed, but the power was hidden in Diana all along. He wanted Rebecca to lead the Congregation and give the witches supremacy over the de Clermonts. He also loved Rebecca and was consumed with jealousy toward Stephen. Nevertheless, he didn't intend to kill them, but desire for power overcame him. Satu felt the same way about the power she sensed in Diana. She reveals Meridiana's prophecy to Knox and tells him their highest priority should be getting Diana away from Matthew.

Sarah plans to start over with teaching Diana to cast spells. Matthew is frustrated that she doesn't know any defensive magic. Sarah tells him those spells stopped working generations ago, and even the simple spells will help Diana learn control. Diana agrees to train in spellcasting with Sarah and in self-defense with Matthew.

As Sarah and Diana practice a fire spell, Matthew finds an ancient object at the house and asks Emily about it. Emily says it was a gift from Stephen, and Matthew realizes he was a timewalker. Diana soon begins to manifest this talent as well, disappearing from the house when she gets frustrated with Sarah and appearing minutes later in the barn.

Domenico visits Gerbert's home and resumes taunting Juliette. He promises to bring her Diana's file, which she can use to find Matthew or destroy to prove she is free of her obsession. Baldwin later finds Gerbert and Juliette at church. Gerbert tries to put the blame on Juliette for conspiring with Satu, but Juliette refuses to take the fall and walks out on Gerbert. Domenico watches her leave.

Agatha visits Hamish in London and reveals the connection between Sophie and Diana. She asks for his help to bring them together.

Matthew is helping Diana to hone her reflexes and respond more quickly to danger. As they practice in the woods, Diana injures her hand and sees the effect her blood has on Matthew. Remembering their encounter at the boathouse, she teases him and starts to run. The danger of being chased by him allows her to fly. It also ignites their passion for each other.

As they lie in bed, Matthew tells Diana about two human women he loved in the past, who wound up dying because of him. Diana assures him he will never hurt her, and that she is powerful enough to stop him if he does.

Marcus and Miriam show up at the Bishop house, prompting it to deliver an envelope from Stephen addressed to Diana. It contains one of the missing pages from Ashmole 782, which depicts two figures very similar to Diana and Matthew. Sarah takes the page to her stillroom for analysis. Diana recognizes her father's handwriting and realizes a note that she saw in the book was written by him. Matthew concludes that Stephen meant for Diana to have the Book of Life.

Domenico finds the still powerless Satu in Venice and takes her captive. He lets Baldwin know he will hold onto her for now, but makes it clear that he expects something in return.

Diana and Matthew continue their practice in the woods. Diana has her eyes closed, trying to locate Matthew by magic, but the vampire she senses in the barn turns out to be Juliette."

But will they escape in time?",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Sarah Walker'],"['', '']",[],"['alchemy', 'witchcraft', 'oxford', 'demon', 'blood', 'mythology', 'time travel', 'sorcery', 'venice italy', 'folklore', 'slit wrist', 'season finale', 'triple f rated', 'reference to christopher marlowe']",[],"Juliette has Diana by the throat and rages at Matthew for abandoning her. Gerbert made her into everything that Matthew desired, and now she has no purpose. Matthew tries to defuse the situation, but Juliette tosses Diana aside and attacks him, slashing his neck and stabbing him through the chest. Diana kills Juliette with a bow and arrow made of witch fire. As Matthew lies dying, Diana calls on the Goddess and offers to do anything to save him. Sarah sees Marcus and Miriam running with supernatural speed to the barn and follows them. Marcus insists nothing can heal both of Matthew's wounds, and Sarah urges Diana to let him go.

The Goddess accepts Diana's bargain, with a price yet to be named. A ritual knife appears in Diana's hand and she cuts open her wrist to let Matthew feed. He then latches onto her neck, but stops short of draining her completely. Marcus saves Diana's life with a blood transfusion. As she recovers, Matthew realizes that if Juliette could find them, Knox can too. If they timewalk, they can hide from the Congregation until Diana fully masters her powers.

Gerbert asks Domenico if he has any news on Juliette, but he pleads ignorance. He does have something else to share, however, and he expects to be rewarded. He leads Gerbert to Satu, who promises him information he can use against Baldwin in order to appease his anger at her for setting Meridiana free.

Emily learned from Stephen that a timewalker needs three objects from the precise time and place they wish to go. However, she doesn't know how Stephen returned, only that it was harder the further in the past he went. The house delivers an ancient witch's poppet, inside which Diana finds an earring that Matthew recognizes as Ysabeau's. Hamish retrieves some of Matthew's possessions from Sept-Tours and brings them to the Bishop house, along with Sophie and Nathaniel.

Sophie's family heirloom is a small statue of the goddess Diana. Matthew recognizes this too, as it is actually a chess piece he lost in a bet on All Souls' Night long ago. Sophie also reveals her secret heritage. While Nathaniel and Marcus become instant friends, Sophie confides in Sarah and Emily about her fears of persecution.

Gerbert convinces Peter Knox to join forces against Baldwin. Satu can prove that he has been helping Matthew, and then they can force him to relinquish his position. Philippe ensured that a de Clermont must always sit on the Congregation, but Gerbert predicts that Marcus will be easier to control.

Diana practices timewalking, focusing on her need to be at the destination. As a test, she takes Matthew back to the night they danced at Sept-Tours. They make a successful return and the witches, vampires, and daemons have one last dinner together. Diana has not yet learned when and where they will go, telling Hamish she wants to enjoy the present moment as long as she can. Hamish warns her that Matthew was not the same man in the past.

The Congregation meets, but instead of ruling on Satu's fate, Gerbert accuses Baldwin of treason and demands not only his removal, but his execution. Gerbert also reveals the existence of the Knights of Lazarus as proof that the de Clermonts are playing both sides. A vote is held, but thanks to the daemons and Domenico, it goes in Baldwin's favor. Both Domenico and Agatha let Baldwin know he owes them.

The daemons depart the Bishop house, with Matthew giving Nathaniel Ysabeau's address in case they need sanctuary. Sarah and Emily are going directly to Sept-Tours. Matthew transfers leadership of the Knights of Lazarus to a reluctant Marcus. Miriam plans to keep studying Diana's DNA.

The two objects Diana already has point to All Hallows' Eve 1590, and Matthew provides the third, an inscribed copy of Doctor Faustus from his friend Christopher Marlowe. Baldwin calls to warn them Gerbert and the witches are on their way. Just as Diana makes her final preparations, their enemies arrive on their doorstep."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0521326/?ref_=ttep_ep31,,Brilliant chemist John Wickware is seemingly catatonic since his wife spent the night at a friend's house. The wife's parents want John committed . Casey thinks there is an organic cause.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Alex March'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"The parents of the wife (Carol Rossen) of a formerly brilliant chemist (James Franciscus) want their daughter to divorce her husband. Nine months earlier, the woman left her husband for only 24 hours to babysit her friend's children at their home. When she returned to her own house, her wise and kind husband, a renown scientist with a 163 IQ, suddenly had the mentality of a small child. He was totally dependent on her to do all but the smallest tasks for him. He couldn't be trusted to drink a cup of hot coffee without spilling the liquid on himself or walk from room to room without tripping over things. When he falls into a mirror and badly cuts his forehead, the man is taken to Los Angeles County General Hospital (now County/USC) and is seen by Dr. Ben Casey (Vincent Edwards). Casey is fascinated by the man and this case, especially after the chemist's wife explains the sudden change in her husband those months ago and the fact that 14 previous doctors could not find anything physically wrong with him. Casey runs tests and while his superior, Dr. David Zorba (Sam Jaffe), allows Casey much latitude, eventually everyone but Casey becomes frustrated and wants the man committed to a mental institution. Even the man's wife reluctantly agrees, finally saying that she will give in to her parents' wishes. Casey asks for more time to find a logical cause for the man's condition, but Zorba instead sends in psychiatrist Dr. McMillan (Leo Penn) to examine the man. Zorba hopes that McMillan can change Casey's mind, which would free Casey to return to his normal neurological duties. After McMillan delivers a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia, he and Casey argue. However, since Casey and McMillan were friends before this case, they agree to work together to give their patient one last chance to prove himself sane before the man is committed. Casey fears that should that happen, the man will not only never get out of the institution, but he will also obviously lose his wife. Using a novel technique, the doctors discover what actually happened to the man. This allows Casey to tell the wife that she will eventually get back the husband she once knew, but only if she can remain patient, even if her parents seemingly cannot."

Meanwhile, Abby and Matt Cable take a sheriff's boat out into the swamp to search for Matt. Lucilia Cable, Matt's mother, arrives and asks them if they've found Alec's remains. Matt says that they won't, and Abby tells Lucilia that Alec was investigating illegal dumping. Lucilia doesn't believe her, and tells her deputies to continue searching down the showed. She insists that what she saw was ""like a man"", not a bear, despite Matt figuring it was a bear. Lucilia tells Abby to come hold and her deputies to keep an eye out for a bear. Disgusted, Abby storms out.

Stumbling through the swamp, Swamp Thing trips and sees his reflection in the water.

Suzie Coyle wakes up in the hospital and mimics Alec's motions as he tries to pull the vegetation off of his skull. He realizes that he's now the plants and can't pull them off. Suzie goes into convulsions and a doctor runs to her, as Swamp Thing roars in anger and frustration.

Abby returns to Liz's place and the two of them sit out by the dock fire pit. They share drinks and Liz says that she's heard about explosion. They talk about how Alec seemed like a good idea, and Abby admits that she liked Alec.

At the hospital, Suzie lies staring up at the ceiling. Dr. Harlan Edwards comes in, and Suzie tells him that she didn't have a nightmare. She talks about how ""he"" was hurting himself and doesn't understand what is happening to him. Harlan doesn't understand, and Suzie talks about ""the man in the dark"" and how he's scared. The girl says that she needs to go to him, and Harlan assumes that she was dreaming and tells her to get some rest. Once Harlan leaves, Suzie looks at the branches blowing in the wind, tapping against the window.

The next day at the Sunderland manor, Avery wakes up in his bed and calls to Maria. He gets up and looks for his wife, and finds her on the bed in their dead daughter Shawn's room. When Avery comes over, Maria says that when Shawna was a little girl, sometimes she would lie down to her just to hear her breath. Avery sits next to his wife, and Maria says that he wasn't around and didn't know Shawna like he did. He says that he loved Shawna, too, gets up, and walks out.

Later that morning, Harlan calls Abby, and she has a nightmare of Shawna's corpse grabbing her hand. Snapping out of it, Abby answers the phone and Harlan tells her that Suzie had an ""episode"" during the night. He says that they have two new cases, and they're on the drug regiment and stable so far. Abby figures that the disease isn't causing.

Abby goes to the kitchen for coffee, and finds a woman, Margaux, there. They introduce themselves and Liz comes in and kisses her lover. Margaux leaves to her fishing boat, and Abby asks Liz if she thinks Alec's boat blowing up was an accident. Liz doesn't, and Abby tells her that Alec was tracking the source of the disease. She says that two new cases came in, and she has to get into Alec's work and see if he found anything. When Liz warns that the police have secured Alec's lab, Abby suggests that Avery can have her access. Her friend warns against Avery, warning that he's a master manipulator, and Abby insists that she's going to be fine and leaves.

At the Sunderland manor, Abby goes in and looks at photos of Shawna hanging on the wall and on the mantle. Avery comes in and greets Abby, and says that he can't believe it's been 14 years since the last time she was there. Abby says that she's there as a CDC doctor, and Avery has her sit down and apologizes. He tells Abby that he never blamed her for Shawn's death the way Maria did, and he should have stood up for Abby 14 years ago. However, Avery couldn't bear to fight with Maria after they lost Shawna. Abby accepts the apology and asks if Maria is all right, and Avery says that they'll get through it.

Avery asks what he can do for the CDC, and has already heard that Alec died. Abby wants to get into his lab to see his research, and Avery figures that it's locked down so Abby came to him. He points out that the lab is filled with Sunderland propriety information, and claims that there's nothing in there that he thinks would help her investigation. Abby figures that she can't get the information before Avery's lawyers take away, and Avery tells her that he still loves her no matter what happened. She realizes that he's manipulating her... again.

Maria goes to see Madame Xanadu, and asks the blind fortune teller for her help. The Sunderland woman says that she can't forget the loss of her only child, and she can't let her go. Maria says that she can hear Shawna again, calling out to her. Xanadu has Maria sit down at her table and has her think about Shawna wile touching Maria's forehead.

Maria concentrates, and Xanadu tells Maria to show her what she's thinking. Xanadu falls to the ground and screams, knocking Maria across the room. After a moment, Xanadu crawls over to Maria and tells her that there is something out there and she touched something fast and dark growing in the rot of the swamp. She advises Maria to let go of Shawna.

Harlan hears the alarms and goes to Suzie's room, and discovers the girl has gone out the window.

Maria and Liz go to the video store with the back room Alec was renting out from Daniel Cassidy. Dan comes in and says that he was rehearsing for an audition. And points out that he played Blue Devil in the movies. Liz introduces Abby to Dan, who says that Sunderland took Alec's computers back. However, Alec used Dan's computer to upload his work journals.

Abby checks Dan's computer with his permission, and finds a video work journal Alec made about how he was fired. He's still in the swamp, and figures that he's onto something. Abby checks a later log and finds Alec talking about how someone dropped accelerant in the shop. He says that he's been working with Abby, who he considers very smart and driven. Alec says that Abby is also very lovely. Liz comes in and Abby pauses the video, then gets a text from Harlan that Suzie is missing and heads for the hospital.

Jason Woodrue and his wife Caroline arrive at the Sutherland manor for a meeting, and Caroline warns her husband not to be bluntly honest with Sutherland even though he ordered Jason to Marais while funding Jason's research, saying he had an emergency. The housekeeper, Hhh, comes out to greet them and direct them to the back of the manor where he's working on his golf swing.

When the couple go around the back, Jason immediately spots a tree that is somewhat withered. As Avery comes out, Jason asks the man working on the landscape if he's a gardener. When Jason comes over, he introduces himself to Avery. Avery says that the accelerant works, but they also have people infected with a ""green flu"". Jason insists that his accelerant isn't responsible, and the swamp is responsible. Unconvinced, Avery tells Jason to fix the situation, and he can't have his name linked to the disease.

When Abby arrives, she tells Matt what happened to Suzie. They have a half hour of daylight left. Matt gets a call that his people found something on the south docs.

Going to the docks, Abby talks to a fisherman, Conyer. He found Suzie's medical wristband ripped off on a railing. Conyer says that the game warden, Vern Robitelle, docks there and was heading to Skeeter Cove. They found Suzie's father's boat near there, and Abby figures Suzie went into the swamp

Vern's boat heads through the swamp, and Suzie is hiding the back. The game warden hears a report about Suzie on the radio and shuts it off, then spots some boats out on the water. He calls it in via the radio, but says that he doesn't need backup and he's going to get closer to see what's going on. Vern pulls over and sees the men pulling boxes of accelerant out of the water. The game warden tells them to surrender, and one of the men--Landreaux--calls out to Vern, recognizing him.

Vern pulls over and asks what is in the box. Landreaux's crew man, Munson, kills Vern and says that Avery will kill them if the law gets their hands on the boxes. He tells Landreaux to pull up the rest of the boxes while he sinks Vern's boat with Vern on it. Swamp Thing is in the water nearby, and emerges as he hears them.

As Abby and Matt prepare to go out and Abby fuels up the sheriff's boat, Lucilla arrives and asks Matt if he trusts himself with Abby. She warns her son that his getting involved with Abby is a recipe for disaster, and Abby will eventually go back to Atlanta.

Matt and Abby go into the swamp, and Matt notes that people get drawn back to Marais. Abby insists that she's only passing through, and Matt says that it was a gutsy choice for her to come back and face the Sunderlands. Matt admits that he had a crush on Abby in high school, and Abby admits that she had no idea.

Swamp Thing prepares to move out.

Munson dumps Vern's body in the boat, and Suzie crawls out from hiding and jumps into the water. The thug hears her and sees Suzie get to shore and run off into the swamp. Munson grabs a machete and goes after the girl.

Suzie runs through the swamp, and Munson chases her. Swamp Thing follows his calls to Suzie, while Suzie comes to a dead-end in the swamp. The girl jumps in and hides beneath the remains of an old house.

Abby trains her flashlight on the swamp and spots the boat. She points it out to Matt, who takes the sheriff's boat over. They find Vern's body, and he's still alive. Abby sees Suzie's footprints in Vern's blood, and tells Matt to check out the other boat while she tends to Vern.

Munson comes to the old house and drives a machete through the floorboards. Suzie screams and Abby hears the girl. She radios Matt to come back and then goes to investigate.

Suzie swims through the water in the flooded house, and Munson breaks in through a window. The girl climbs to an upper floor, and Munson comes up after her. Before he can kill her, he hears something moving in the water below. Munson drops down and Swamp Thing attacks him. The thug draws h is knife and stabs Swamp Thing, but the blade has no effect and Swamp Thing throw Munson into the water. Suzie looks on as Munson stares at Swamp Thing and wonders what he is. When Munson comes at Swamp Thing, vines wrap around him, pull him out, and strangle him to death.

Suzie approaches Swamp Thing, who sees her and stares back at her. He looks at her for a moment.

Abby makes her way through the swamp and comes to the house. She finds the girl on the dock outside, and Swamp Thing emerges from the shadows. Abby sees him and they look at each other. The doctor tells Suzie to walk to her, and the girl hesitantly does so. Swamp Thing stares at the two of them and watches as Abby leaves with the girl.

Going back to the main river, Abby sees Matt and calls to him. She holds Suzie and looks back, but there's no sign of Swamp Thing.

At the manor, Avery calls to Maria. Maria is lying next to Shawn's animated corpse.

Matt takes Abby and Suzie back to the dock. He talks to Lucilia, saying that he'll be there in twenty minutes. Meanwhile, Suzie tells Abby that Swamp Thing is afraid and doesn't know what's happening to him. The girl says that she remembers that Swamp Thing said his name was Alec."
