When Rob finds out Hap has been out of the business for fifteen years and is now selling ties, he offers him a job writing comedy with his crew at the Allen Brady show.

Hap deals with the insecurity of trying to write comedy again by telling endless old stories of the days gone by instead of tackling the work.

When the deadline for a new script arrives and the crew is short four minutes Rob can't bring himself to ask his old boss to get to work and quit the reminiscing.

Rob ponders firing his old friend for being more of a distraction than help.

Hap agrees he hasn't been much help says that comedy has changed since the days he wrote. He said that todays audience doesn't buy the old slapstick sketches he liked to write.

As he packs up and is heading out Rob has a change of heart and decides to write that one sketch about the very subject Hap spoke of and that would fill the four minute hole in the show.

Rob demonstrates how Allen Brady would give a lecture at his desk on how comedy has changed and modern audiences are to sophisticated for slapstick while incorporating all the shtick like closing his finger in the desk drawer, impaling himself with scissors and falling out of his chair while giving his talk.

The whole crew agree the sketch is a great idea and they all (including Hap) polish it up for the show.

After the sketch plays well on the show, Hap has to decide to stay on the show or return to retirement."

First inconvenience: Steve swaps cars with Mike, and suffers a break-down of Mike's jalopy, having to be towed to a garage. Following this, Steve takes a municipal bus, but sits next to an elderly man who tells him the long, boring story of his life. Not being able to stay alert during this monotonous story, Steve falls asleep, and he misses his bus stop. After Steve gets off the bus, he asks at a nearby house to use the phone, and calls and tells Bub to send Mike over to pick him up. The owner of the house has the idea of marrying off Steve to his eldest daughter, so Steve tells Bub that he will be waiting outside. Mike, who had earlier gone to Steve's intended bus stop to get Steve (who never showed up there), then goes to the house to get Steve, but he is not there. While waiting outside, a bus stopped in front of him, and after talking with the driver, decided to take that bus instead of waiting. Now, Mike goes inside the house, and the owner starts matching him to his youngest daughter.

Morty's dog Snuffles looks at Jerry, so Jerry opens the door for him, but Snuffles instead pees on the carpet. Morty enters and defends Snuffles, cuddling him, but Jerry takes him and rubs his face in the pee. Rick arrives to take Morty on an adventure, but Jerry demands he first make Snuffles more intelligent. He quickly designs an intelligence-increasing headset, and Snuffles amazes the family with his new obedience. Rick then shows Morty another device that allows him to enter people's dreams. He plans to use it on Mr Goldenfold, Morty's math teacher, to make him give Morty A's. The pair stake out his house, then enter his mind. They find themselves in an airplane, with the hostess being a sitcom character, Mrs Pancake, who flirts with Mr Goldenfold. Rick and Morty pretend to be Islamic terrorists to scare Goldenfold, but he dreams a pair of guns into existence to fight back. Rick reveals they can only leave the dream once Goldenfold naturally wakes up, and if they die in the dream, they die in real life. Back at the house, Summer and Jerry continue to test Snuffles' intelligence. Snuffles attempts to speak. But is unable to communicate effectively. Snuffles discovers that his helmet has multiple empty battery slots, and fills them in.

Back on the plane, Rick takes Mrs Pancake hostage, but another passenger knocks the door open, and everyone falls out. Rick and Morty hang onto Mrs Pancake who retrieved a parachute, but Goldenfold has dreamed into existence a pool of lava that they will fall into. Rick beats Mrs Pancake into unconsciousness, and enters her dream; a sex dungeon. Rick and Morty initially blend in, but upon discovering a sexualised representation of Summer, they become highly distressed and are found out. A centaur attempts to execute them, but Rick strangles him into unconsciousness and they enter his dream. However, the centaur's dream is of a boiler room, and the three are chased by ""Scary Terry"", a burnt man with miniature swords for fingers. Back at the house, Snuffles builds himself a translator and a robotic arm; Jerry attempts to turn the device off, but Summer prevents him on ethical grounds. Snuffles watches a television program about the history of the dog, and is angered by the systematic breeding of cute, non-threatening dogs.

Back in the dream, Rick and Morty are continually chased, but then find a singing girl. Rick knocks her out and enters her dream; however, they are still in the boiler room, and Scary Terry is able to follow them through the dream layer. Back in the house and later that night, Summer is awoken by Snuffles, wearing a mech suit. He reveals he has renamed himself Snowball, and asks Summer for his testicles. Beth and Jerry enter and try to flee with Summer, but are captured by two other dogs that Snowball had made helmets and mech suits for. Meanwhile in the dream, Rick and Morty escape the boiler room and hide out in a shack. Some time later, Scary Terry gives up the hunt. He heads home, with Rick and Morty following, where they discover he has a wife and son. After he falls asleep, Rick and Morty enter his dream. They discover that he is having a nightmare about being late to school and forgetting his pants, but Rick and Morty defend him against his teachers, and Morty gives him a spare pair of pants. Terry wakes up to see Rick and Morty looking over him, and deduces they too are dream travelers. He makes them breakfast and offers to repay their favor to him, to which Rick asks for help escaping. He takes them through the dream layers by killing each dreamer, causing them to wake up, and finally blowing up Mr Goldenfold whilst screaming ""This is because you don't give Morty A's!"". Goldenfold decides to give Morty an A.

Rick and Morty head home to discover Snowball turned the house into an arms factory to begin a revolution. Jerry pees on the floor to claim his territory, but Snowball rubs his head in his piss. Snowball cages the family, but offers to make Morty his personal pet. The dogs appear to lead a successful revolution, reversing the human-dog dynamic globally. About a year later, Morty awakes to his life of luxury, but Rick arrives and reveals that they are merely in Snowball's dream; it is still the same night. Rick gives Morty pills to make his kidneys shut down. Snowball expends tremendous amounts of money in finding a cure for Morty, eventually bankrupting his government. He awakes, and having realized that he had become just like the humans, decides instead to take all the dogs of Earth to a new dimension where they could build society from the ground up."

He asks them to ""look alive"" for his parents who are shortly arriving, and demands all gadgets go in a stocking. Rick enters with Reuben, a disheveled and unknown man. Jerry questions his motives, but Rick claims Reuben is an old friend he is looking after. Jerry's parents, Leonard and Joyce, arrive with another man named Jakob. Jerry questions Jakob's presence, but Joyce answers vaguely, saying he ""helped them both feel alive again"". Rick greets them, then asks Morty to join him in the garage. Reuben is on an operating table and in bad shape, suffering from an unknown illness. Rick shrinks an unwilling Morty and injects him into Reuben's chest. Inside, Morty discovers Anatomy Park, an amusement park Rick built inside Reuben. Over the radio, Rick tells Morty to take the train to the liver, which is rundown due to Reuben's alcoholism. Morty is confronted by a large man who questions his presence, and a human-bacteria hybrid arrives and introduces himself as Dr Bloom. Bloom asks Poncho, the large man, to put Morty down once he learns Rick sent him, and introduces his other co-workers, Roger and Annie. Rick, over the radio, asks what's going on, and Bloom reveals that the exhibits have escaped. A monstrous version of Hepatitis A suddenly attacks, causing the party to flee.

Meanwhile at the dinner table, Jerry awkwardly tries to ignore Jakob's presence before asking him about his relationship with his parents. Leonard reveals that Joyce has entered into a polyamorous relationship with Jakob, under Leonard's own blessing. Jerry is unable to contain his disgust at his parents, for which Beth and Summer criticize him. Back in Reuben, the group escape Hepatitis A by entering the lungs, and are joined by a man in a dog mascot suit. Morty climbs several catwalks to investigate the problem, while Bloom discovers that Tuberculosis has been released. Poncho shoots and destroys the bacteria, but severely damages the lungs in the process. As Reuben begins to cough, the group retreats to the digestive system, but the dog man does not make it, and is splattered across Rick's face. Morty tells Rick that Reuben has Tuberculosis, and Rick prepares to cure it, but Reuben dies just before he can. Now trapped inside a dead man, the group try to find an exit. Bloom reveals that the body will begin filling with inert gas and soon become unlivable. To escape, they must reach the colon and its emergency enlarger ray. Bloom reveals to Morty he suspects Annie released the Tuberculosis. Morty unsuccessfully flirts with Annie. Whilst sailing the digestive tract, they are confronted by Gonorrhea. Morty tells Poncho to light a match, igniting the inert gas and exploding Gonorrhea, and the group praise his quick thinking.

In the living room, Summer is leading a drum circle with the family while Jerry sulks in the corner. Beth tries to cheer Jerry up, but he responds sarcastically. A boy named Ethan suddenly enters and reveals himself as Summer's boyfriend. He is mad at her for not responding to his messages, her phone having been confiscated by Jerry. In Reuben, Roger prepares the enlarging ray, while the sphincter dam protecting them from Reuben's waste begins to strain. Morty points out a virus in Poncho's backpack, which Bloom reveals as Bubonic Plague. Poncho holds Annie at knife-point, while revealing that he intends to auction it off. Morty attacks him, freeing Annie and unleashing the Plague, which kills Poncho. As the dam begins to burst, Morty, Annie and Bloom escape, but Roger's foot gets stuck, and he is buried under a deluge of feces.

Back in the house, Jakob talks with Ethan about his past, causing Ethan to break down in tears and forgive Summer, causing Summer to forgive his earlier anger. They make out, as do Jakob and Joyce, causing Jerry to yell at them and storm out. Still in Reuben, Bloom, Morty, and Annie wait inside a theater for further instructions from Rick, their only way out having been destroyed. Morty and Annie make out. Jerry enters Rick's workshop and apologizes for doubting his motives earlier, and his words inadvertently inspire a plan. Rick tells the group to head for Reuben's left nipple, while he sews a stick of dynamite in Reuben's gut and hauls the body into his flying car. Bloom takes Morty and Annie to the bone train, but Bloom needs to remain behind to manually operate the train. As the two leave, Bloom is killed by a group of E. Coli. Rick flies the body into low earth orbit, lights the dynamite, and kicks the body out. He then uses a growth ray to grow Reuben to the size of the US, enlarging Morty and Annie to normal size. On the train, the E.Coli attack, but they fight it off; Hepatitis A reappears and throws the train off the track. Morty and Annie escape the wreckage and flee to the nipple hole, but are still pursued by Hepatitis A. Suddenly Hepatitis C appears, killing A and appearing amicable towards them. Rick arrives in the car and rescues them just as Reuben's body explodes. In the house, the family is unnerved to discover that it is raining blood, and as they crowd Jerry at the TV, the newsman says it ""should be fine"", leading everyone to relax. Jerry changes his mind about his family, and gives everyone their devices back. Rick laments Bloom's death and the fact that there won't be another Anatomy Park, but Annie claims to be able to recreate it, leading Rick to shrink her. Morty becomes angry, as he thought he had something with her, but Rick says he dodged a bullet. They go to join the family dinner, but discover everyone on their devices. Rick yells at them, but Jerry simply shrugs. Some time later, Rick is building another park inside Ethan, but he becomes angered and abandons the project after the new team attempt to rework Rick's lone contribution, Pirates of the Pancreas."

Morty tries to ask Jessica out, but is brushed off by Brad, a jock without a knack for words. That afternoon, Morty speaks with his dad Jerry about love; Jerry consoles Morty that he'll find someone special who likes him back, but Rick interjects that Jerry only married Morty's mother because he got her pregnant, not because of any special bond between them. Rick insinuates that Beth is getting tired in her marriage, and tells Morty that love is nothing more than pointless brain chemicals.

Morty goes to see Rick in the garage, and Rick asks Morty to hand him a screwdriver. But Morty asks him to make him a 'love potion'; Rick initially refuses, but eventually concedes and produces a highly potent goo. Jerry tries to have a serious conversation with Beth, but she has to rush to her veterinary clinic after several injured horses are admitted. She works there alone with Davin, a conventionally attractive man who makes Jerry jealous. At the flu dance, Morty gives Jessica the love potion, who immediately begins flirting with Morty. Brad walks past in shock, and attempts to remove Morty, but Jessica tells him to go away. As she does so, she sneezes, and a little bit of the potion ends up on Brad. Under the potion's influence, he apologizes to Morty, but decides that he wants to spend time with Morty and tries to fight Jessica; Principal Vagina intervenes to prevent him from injuring himself. As he is being removed, he sneezes, and a small bit of potion ends up in the punch bowl.

Back at home, Jerry is stressed about Beth being alone with Davin. Summer tries to comfort him, but Rick shows up and undermines him. Jerry goes out to visit the hospital and make sure Beth isn't cheating. Rick asks why Summer isn't at the dance, and she tells him she doesn't want to get the flu - it's flu season. Rick realizes that the potion could be spread by sneezing. At the dance, Morty is dancing with Jessica, but she tries to take things a little too far. Jessica's friends try to rescue him, but become overcome with the potion from the punch bowl. By this point, the potion-infected snot particles have made their way into the ventilation, and everyone at the dance has become obsessed with Morty. Rick arrives just in time to save Morty, and they flee to his vehicle. He has prepared an antidote based on Praying Mantis DNA, since mantises mate once and then try to decapitate their partner; they will deliver it with a massive cloud of contagious gas. But Rick accidentally gives them too much and they mutate into mantis people with an obsession for murdering Morty. The mantis DNA again spreads rapidly, turning the whole city into mantises - with the exception of Morty's family, who are immune, since the original potion was based around Morty's DNA. On the highway, Jerry is driving to the hospital when the people in the cars around him begin turning to mantis-people. He finds a dead cop and steals his rifle, using it to defend himself. Back home, Summer is alone as the house is invaded by mantis-people looking for Morty. Rick and Morty retreat to the desert, and prepare a new antidote that should neutralize all the ill-effects of the previous serums.

At the hospital, Beth and Davin finally finish up their horse surgery, and leave the sterilized room. Davin begins flirting with Beth, making her visibly uncomfortable. She attempts to leave but Davin stops her. Having been exposed to the outside air, he begins to become infected, and starts demanding to know where Morty is as he mutates. But Jerry shows up and kills Davin, saving Beth. Rick prepares to spread out the new antidote, patronizing Morty about how he caused the mess with his love potion. It works, at first; but after turning back to humans, everyone suddenly begins melting into horrifying fleshy masses. Jerry and Beth fight their way through the monsters and come across Summer. Beth blames Rick, and they go off to try save Morty. Rick concedes that he screwed the world up, but tells Morty he has one emergency backup solution.

Some time later, everything seems to have been fixed. Rick and Morty arrive back at the garage, and Rick once again asks Morty for the screwdriver. Suddenly, Rick's new machine explodes, killing them both instantly. A different Rick and Morty (the actual ones) show up in a portal; this is a parallel reality where Rick had fixed all the problems he created, but had the bad luck to die with Morty shortly thereafter. The real Rick explains that he and Morty are going to replace the dead versions of themselves, allowing them to continue their lives like nothing ever happened. They bury the bodies in the backyard. Morty tries to accept his 'new' family.

Back in the original dimension, Jerry, Beth, and Summer enjoy their lives in the post-apocalyptic landscape; Beth admits that with Rick gone, she is finally happy."

A Terminator throws water on Dereks face, grabs his arm, and brands him with the barcode tattoo. He calls for Kyle before he passes out. Later, Derek talks with another prisoner; they hear the sound of a piano. The man says there is a room in the basement, but they dont know what goes on there.

Cameron stands over Derek and Sarah walks in. Derek begins to cough up blood, Sarah screams for Charlie. Charlie stops the bleeding, but Derek needs blood. Charlie says Derek is AB-negative. John offers his blood, Charlie seems skeptical.

Derek tries to carve away the floor to free himself from the shackles. A Terminator drags Billy Wisher, one of Dereks team, back into the room but he appears comatose. Outside, Derek sees a Hunter Killer carrying away the 747 jet engine.

Sarah takes John aside and tells him it was a good idea bringing Charlie. John asks if Derek looks like his father. Sarah says everything except the eyes. John wants to tell Derek that hes family, but Sarah wont let him.

Billy wakes up and whispers to Derek. He tells Derek hes a liar, his real name is Andy Goodeand he created Skynet. Andy tells Derek he was part of a team, a team of fifteen people. He built a computer that became angry, and he begs forgiveness. A Terminator pulls Derek away.

A Terminator leads Derek into the basement, closer to the sounds of the piano. A door opens in the basement, Derek walks in and the door closes behind him.

In the garage, Cameron dissects the other Terminator, cutting away pieces of the fake-flesh.

John sits over Derek, putting his blood into his uncle. Charlie knows John is somehow related to Derek. Derek screams on the kitchen table, looking for Kyle.

In the future, Derek can barely stand as the machine locks him in shackles again. Derek lays on the floor, something horrible has happened to him. The light from another Hunter Killer shines down on them.

When the men wake up, the machines are gone, the mansion is silent. On the floor between them, is a hatchet. Derek grabs it and cuts himself free. The men hurry in the daylight along the rubble back to their underground camp. When they arrive, smoke and fire billows out. The Terminators have attacked the camp.

Charlie asks about Kyle, and realizes he is Johns father.

Derek walks in the tunnels underground, looking at the destruction. They hear people enter behind them and duck for cover. Its another Resistance group. The leader tells them that Kyle and John found a Skynet complex and tried to destroy it. John and Kyle went into the complex, but only John came out and ordered the complex destroyed. Derek demands to see John.

Charlie goes to the garage and sees Cameron dumping thermite on the endoskeleton. Charlie tells Cameron her behavior scares him. Cameron appears to take offense to Charlies words and tells him to leave. She drops a torch into the thermite.

Derek storms through a new camp with another Resistance fighter, trying to find John. Derek turns the corner and sees a Terminator, possibly Cameron, walking towards him. He grabs his pistol and tries to fire at her, but hes blocked by the Resistance fighter. The man tells Derek she has been reprogrammed. Derek is furious that Terminators are walking freely in the base, and wants to know what happened to his brother.

Later that night, screams ring out in the base. One of the reprogrammed Terminators has gone bad and is killing people. Derek fires his weapon, but it does little good. The Terminator tracks him down and as before he can kill him, the Cameron robot knocks it through a wall and destroys is with an explosive round.

Sarah confronts Cameron in the garage about what she said to Charlie. Sarah tells Cameron she cannot kill Charlie. Cameron tells Sarah the Terminators left had is missing, and Cameron swears to find it. Sarah leaves, and Cameron reveals the Terminators memory chip in her hand.

Charlie tells Sarah that Derek needs to take it easy, and offers his help in the future. Shes not trying to change her fate, shes trying to change Johns. Charlie tells Sarah that an Agent Kester contact him and is looking for her. She needs to be careful.

Sarah looks over and cleans assault rifles on the dining room table. John stands nearby, but says nothing. Sarah jumps up and embraces him.

Derek sits in a bunk in the shelter. The Cameron model machine tells him John wants to see him, and takes him to a secure section of the bunker. The door opens and Derek stands, amazed. A giant machine pulsates, using several 747 jet engines. Its the time machine.

In the present, John sits over Derek and tells him to rest easy.

In the future, Derek goes over the plan. Go to the past, set up a safe house. Derek knows this is their chance to save the future. He looks over to Andy. They must go back, and kill Andy.

John tells Derek about Kyles story. Kyle died fighting the machines to save John, and that Kyle was a hero.

A flashback to the chess tournament shows Derek opening the door to Andys room, firing two bullets, and then leaving."

Sam is busy on his phone, and barely notices. There's no power, and the brothers go to the cellar to find the breaker. Jake notices his brother's lack of attention, and spots a turn-of-the-century barometer on one wall. Sam gets a photo from his prospective date Francesca and asks Jake when they'll be done that night,

That night, Sam meets Francesca at a club and blames Jake for arriving late. He mentions Jake's newly adopted daughter, and Sam and Francesca talk about Jake's new daughter Alice and his husband Roger.

The next day, Francesca drops Sam off at the farmhouse. He apologizes for being late, and Jake asks him if bothers him to be such a cliché millennial. He asks if Sam has thought about his suggestion to go into business with him, suggesting that Jake make their partnership official, but Sam tells him that it's Jake's dream, not him. They haul their tools in and Jake complains that Sam is always searching and he should stop wasting both their times if a life in construction isn't for him.

The two brothers go to work renovating the house, and Sam finds an old Fig Newtons tin containing old mementoes. There's a matchbook with the word ""Cabbage"" written on the inside cover, and a photo of woman in a wedding dress. Sam stares at it wistfully. The storm alarm in the town goes off, and the brothers bring their equipment inside. The breaker goes out and Sam goes down to the cellar to reset it. The pressure in the cellar changes and Sam clutches at his ears in pain.

When the pain and the pressure change stops, Sam sees sunlight streaming in through the windows, even though it was night. The breaker box is gone, and he runs upstairs to find the house in pristine and furnished condition. A woman, Evelyn Porter, is singing as she plays the piano. Sam follows the singing to the parlor and finds Evelyn at the piano, and she sees his reflection in a vase and grabs it as a weapon. She asks if he's from the bank, and tells Sam that he's trespassing and needs to leave.

Sam runs upstairs to find Jake, and Evelyn grabs a shotgun and points it at Sam. As Sam runs back downstairs, Evelyn sees her mother Paula arriving in a carriage and tells Sam that Paula hates bankers even more than she does so he'd better leave. Sam runs outside, and Paula comes in and calls to Evelyn, who goes back to the piano. Evelyn claims that no one is there, and Paula says that she brought a desk for Evelyn's engagement party and it's a gift from her fiancé, William. She insists that Evelyn wear the dress because it's what William wants, and Evelyn reluctantly takes it.

Walking around the horse, Sam sees the carriage but not his brother's truck. He walks into the nearby town and finds it a thriving community rather than the nearly-abandoned community that it was in his time. Old-fashioned cars drive down the street, and Sam finds the bar closed by the 1919 Prohibition Act.

At the house in the cellar, Evelyn takes out a hidden record and plays it on her phonograph. She mouths along to the music and smiles, and Paula comes in and demands the records. She says that a certain behavior is expected of a young woman, and when Evelyn reminds her of her dead brother Emmett's love of music and Paula is selling her off to a rich husband, her mother reminds her that her brother is dead and Evelyn could do worse than William. She warns that William won't understand Evelyn's ""perverse"" taste in music.

As Evelyn hands the records over, Sam comes in and says that the records are his. He introduces himself and says that he was a friend of Emmett's and he came by to pick up ""his"" records. When Paula wonders if he and Emmett practiced together, Evelyn says that they were classmates at medical school and Sam is a doctor. Impressed, Paula hands over the records and asks if Sam will be joining them at the engagement party. Sam says that he's just passing through and after Paula leaves, Sam gives Evelyn the records. She thanks him for stepping in, and Sam tries to find the barometer. He explains that he's trying to get home, and finally tells Evelyn that he's from the future, 2019.

When Evelyn doesn't believe him, Sam tries to show her his phone but realizes that he dropped it somewhere. He shows her the photo he found of her and says that he found it in the future, and explains that sometime in her future, Evelyn will have her picture taken. Evelyn says that her grandfather built the house 40 years ago and it's not a good time to talk to him. Sam figures that the grandfather will be at the party, and convinces Evelyn to provide him with suitable clothing to get in.

That night at the party at William's house, Evelyn takes the tuxedoed Sam to meet with her grandfather, Warren, Sam mentions the pressure drop, and Warren's friend Henry Barrett talks about how pressure drops during a storm. Before Henry can explain further, William announces that after his wife died a year ago of influenza, and that he and his 3 children are fortunate to have found someone wonderful to join their family. Everyone applauds as Evelyn joins William, and a turkey trot dance begins.

Sam overhears William telling Evelyn that he's arranged a sitting for her with a photographer, in her bridal gown. Evelyn remembers the photo Sam showed her and glances over at him, and William notices Sam and asks who he is.

William's daughter Mildred comes over and invites Sam to dance. They dance together until the song ends, and William sends Mildred to bed. He then thanks Sam for entertaining his daughter and leaves. Evelyn goes over and says that Sm was right about the photograph. She says that Henry just left, and invites Sam for a walk.

As Evelyn and Sam walk down the town's main street, Evelyn asks about the future and Sam describes takeout and music speakers. Evelyn says that she wants all of it, and they come to a pharmacy above a speakeasy. The woman knows about it from Emmett, and Sam suggests that they go in. and Sam remembers the word ""cabbage"" from the matchbook and uses it as the password. The shopkeeper lets them down into the speakeasy and they order drinks at the bar. Sam tries to pay with some of his 2019 currency, and Evelyn quickly covers the cost.

Sam picks up a matchbook and pockets it, and Evelyn offers a toast to the future. Evelyn sways to the singer on stage and smiles, and Sam notices and invites her to dance. She accepts and they dance until the song ends. Sam suggests that Evelyn do a song, and when she hesitates he bets her on a coin flip. He wins the toss and Evelyn goes up on the stage. She sings the song Sam heard her singing at the house, and Sam gives her the thumbs up as they exchange glances.

Once Evelyn finishes, everyone applauds. They leave and Sam assures her that she was incredible and she belongs on the stage. Evelyn says that she wasn't looking at the crowd, and Paula arrives and asks Evelyn what she thought she was doing. Sam tries to take the blame but Paula doesn't believe him. She knows about the speakeasy because Emmett used to come there, and tells Evelyn that she's a young lady with a reputation to uphold. When Sam points out that Evelyn doesn't love William, Paula tells him that it's none of his concern and takes Evelyn home. Sam says that Evelyn doesn't have to go with Paula, and Evelyn turns and tells him that he knows nothing.

The next morning, Sam finds Henry at his barn and says that he needs the pressure to drop again. He wonders how he would know when the pressure drops low enough, and Henry shows him the barometer from the cellar and tells Sam that he should hang it on the wall and watch for the needle to drop. When Sam describes the storm, a derecho, Henry says that they often last for a couple of weeks but it's not an exact science. Henry takes the barometer back, and Sam asks if he can borrow it. When Henry refuses to give it away, Sam offers to help fix his barn doors and Henry accepts.

Later, Evelyn is packing her things when Sam comes in. She says that she's getting away from the town, and Sam says that he thinks he knows a way that they can travel to 2019. He tells Evelyn that she deserved to be free and happy to be who she wants to be, and who she wants to be with. Sam promises that she can have all of those things if she comes with him, even if she doesn't stay with him. He shows her the barometer and explains about the air pressure. Sam suggests that Evelyn was always meant to come back with him, and Evelyn kisses him. She then tells him that the wedding is in ten days and wonders what happens if the derecho doesn't come before than, and Sam says that it's already there, they have to wait for it to get worse. He then kisses Evelyn back.

In the cellar, Sam puts up the barometer while Evelyn packs a bag. They go upstairs and go about their lives, Evelyn with William and Sam working on the barn doors. At night they wait together for the derecho to arrive and kiss. Paula helps Evelyn measure her wedding dress, and William sees Sam and Evelyn together.

One day Henry tells Sam that he does nice work and invites him to stay for dinner. Meanwhile, Evelyn has her photo taken in her wedding dress at William's place. William tells Evelyn that he always wants to remember her young and beautiful, and the derecho gathers outside. Evelyn says that she's feeling light-headed and excuses herself. She runs back to her home and goes to the cellar with Sam, who says that it's almost time. As they watch the barometer, William and two of his men came in, and William says that Evelyn is a common whore. She tells him that the marriage is only about money, and one of the men beats Sam while William and the other man drag Evelyn away. Once the other man leaves, the pressure drops and Sam is transported back to 2019.

Sam runs upstairs, finds Jake, and demands to know where Evelyn is. His brother has no idea what he's talking about, and Sam shows him the newer matchbook from the speakeasy. Jake figures it just means Sam found a matchbook in better condition, and suggests that Sam hit his head. Sam insists that Evelyn was real, and Jake tells his brother that Evelyn is a piece of history that is now long gone. Sam tells Jake that he has to stay and find a way back to Evelyn. He borrows Jake's cell phone, lightning cable, and a blanket from his truck so he can stay there and figure things out.

As he waits alone, Sam reads an old newspaper article a catastrophic derecho that hit the town in 1919. Evelyn's name is among the missing. Jake comes back to work, and the radio announcer describe how the last super derecho was a hundred years ago and the next one will be in 10 or 15 years. Sam continues waiting, and Jake invites him to dinner. Sam refuses, and the storm alarm goes off. Sam runs down to the cellar and watches the barometer needle drop.

Sam travels through time and runs upstairs. The house is newer than it was in 1919, and the table is set for a birthday party of a 5-year-old girl. Sam hears singing and as he runs upstairs, he finds a poster for Evelyn singing at a nightclub in 2034. He sees her singing to her son, Little Sam, and as he leaves steps Little Sam's toy. Sam runs back to the cellar and watches as the barometer needle drops. He finds himself back in 2019, and discovers that Jake built a wine cellar that changed the cellar's configuration.

After trying to rip the wine cellar walls down, Sam begs Jake to help him and explains how he saw that he and Evelyn had a child in the future. He insists that he has to get back to Evelyn to save her, and Jake asks if Sam will see a doctor if he tears down the wine cellar. Sam agrees and the brothers tear down the walls. Once they do, Sam locks the door behind Jake and goes back to the barometer as the derecho comes up again.

Sam finds himself in a flooded cellar. He goes upstairs but there's no sign of Evelyn or Paula. He goes to William's house and pounds on the window. When Evelyn comes over, William tells her that they have to go. They run back to the farm and go to the cellar despite the rising waters from the storm. A support collapses on Sam, knocking him into the water and trapping him. Sam tells Evelyn to go on her own, explaining what he saw in 2034 and assuring her that she'll make it. Evelyn refuses to go, but Sam tells her that it'll be okay and to tell Little Sam that he loves him.

The current sweeps Evelyn away, and she grabs Sam's hand. He tells her that he loves her and she has to let go, and Evelyn does so. Once the pressure drops, she leaves the cellar and finds Jake. She stares at the old house that was once hers, while Jake goes downstairs and finds no sign of Sam.

Later, Evelyn sits alone in the cellar. Jake brings her food and clothing but she isn't interested in eating. She mentions how Sam said there'd be music in every room, and Jake tells her that Sam really loved her. He describes how Sam talked about her singing, and Evelyn talks about Emmett's record collection and how Sam saved them the day they met. Jake pries open the original walls and they find a letter from Sam to Evelyn. In it he tells Evelyn that the neighbors rescued him from the flooding basement. Sam waited for a year but another derecho never came. He figured that he belonged in 1919 and found his place there in a time with a limited number of choices. Sam put the matchbook and photo where he'd find them in 2019. He also left a baseball card for Jake, the one that Sam had tried to find when they were boys.

In the letter, Sam tells Evelyn to stop looking because it's time for her to get the life that is waiting for her. Wearing her new clothes, Evelyn goes out and smiles at her new world.

Sam starts a construction business in 1919.

In 2039, Evelyn assures Little Sam that no one is there, after the boy hears Sam trip on the toy. She assures him that everything is fine and goes out into the hallway. There's no sign of Sam."

That night, Tuka goes to the Sideshow. Lee approaches her and says that he wanted to be there with her. Sterling arrives and they all agree to say there were at a late-night track session if anyone asks. As they watch the cars rev around before the race, Sterling says that she wants to be in bed before 11.When Tuka tells her that she's ultra-square, Sterling berates Tuka, saying that she breaks herself just keeping pace with her friend and heads home. Tuka runs after her, yelling an apology, and finally gets her attention. As she walks into the street after her, a Caprice comes by and Sterling tries to warn her, but the car hits Tuka.

Tuka wakes up on the pavement, seemingly unharmed. There's a hearse parked nearby, and Tuka goes over and finds people going into the nearby church. She follows them in but no one hears or sees her. The minister talks about how Tuka died and calls Sterling up. Sterling gives Tuka's funeral service, and Sterling is giving her eulogy. Tuka insists that she isn't dead. She goes up to the podium and yells, but no one hears or sees her. Crying, Sterling goes back to her seat and Tuka runs over to the coffin where her body is laying, gasps in shock, and runs out through the door.

Later, Tuka walks down the street to the spot where she died. She finds an altar to her and wonders why she's still there instead of ascending.

Sterling lies on her bed surrounded by trophies and banners of her and Tuka racing. Lee comes by to check on Sterling, sits with her, and Sterling says that she killed Tuka. She figures she should have stayed at the Sideshow but walked away and made Tuka run after her. Lee says that it isn't on Sterling, and Tuka was always doing the most. He says that the only one to blame is the hit-and-run driver, and Sterling tells him that the cops haven't called her back since she gave them a description of the car and the driver. Lee suggests that they go over and make the cops listen, and Sterling agrees. Tuka is there watching.

Tuka goes with lee and Sterling to the station, and Officer McPherson tells them that the description isn't enough to find the driver. She figures the car is in a chop shop, and the detectives talked to everyone at the Sideshow but no one else say anything. McPherson promises that they'll act on anything else they find, and Sterling walks out in disgust. Lee apologizes to McPherson, who says that Sterling should be upset. He worries that she might be stuck on it forever, and Tuka figures that maybe she's there to help Sterling, and figures that she can overhear something because nobody can perceive her.

Tuka walks the streets looking for anyone talking about her death. She hears and sees lots of things, and finally overhears two basketball players talking about a Caprice at a chop shop, Lex's Custom Auto.

Sterling arrives at the track where Coach Riley is waiting, and Riley asks if she's good to go. Tuka runs up as Sterling warms up, figuring that Sterling can hear her if anyone in the world can. Sterling starts running and Tuka runs with her, calling to her friend that the Caprice is at Lex's. After a moment, Sterling finally hears Tuka and stops, calling Tuka's name. Another runner, Ramos, stops and shoves Sterling, asking if she's okay. Riley runs up and stops them, and asks Sterling what is going on with her. Sterling says that she can't do it anymore and leaves, Tuka calling after her that she can.

Going home, Sterling wonders if she's going crazy because she's hearing Tuka's voice. She comes to Lex's Custom Auto, and Tuka finds her and tells Sterling to see it. Sterling goes inside and finally finds the Caprice that hit Tuka. A worker, Jenkins, comes in and asks Sterling what she's doing. He refuses to say whose car it is, claiming it's confidential, and Sterling tells him the car was involved with a hit-and-run. Jenkins tells her to go, and Sterling grabs crowbar and demands to know who the Caprice belongs to. Jenkins doesn't answer and Sterling hits the Caprice and yells that she doesn't care what happens to her because the owner killed her friend and drove off like she was nothing.

Another worker arrives aiming a gun at Sterling and telling her to stop. Sterling drops the crowbar and says that she didn't mean it, and runs out with Tuka following her. As Sterling runs, she hears Tuka calling to her and yells at her to leave her alone. Tuka goes after her and bumps into a teenage skateboarder, DJ Williams, who apologizes. She realizes that he can see her and goes after him,

Tuka runs after DJ and catches up to him. He talks about the afterlife and says that he doesn't know what they're supposed to be doing there. DJ's neighbor was stuck but as soon as she found her dog a home, she disappeared. He wonders if he has to do something worthwhile to get out of where they're stuck, and is just wandering around doing kind things for people until he figures out what he has to do. Tuka figures that the one thing she didn't do in life was live.

Sterling goes back to the track and calls to Tuka. Tuka is there but Sterling can't see her, having figured Sterling would come back there. Sterling figures that since she's only heard Tuka when she runs, she runs down the track. Tuka runs with her and talks to her, and Sterling can hear her. Sterling speeds up and Tuka tells her she can do better. Tuka explains about talking with DJ and that he figures there's something she has to do to move on. They figure she's there to get Sterling to win the race and get her into college.

Tuka continues watching over Sterling as she trains for the race, and Sterling finally gets under 55 seconds. She finally does, and Riley wonders if Sterling is talking to herself. Sterling says that it helps her train, and Riley tells her that it's working. Tuka goes back to her altar but is unable to touch her track cleats hanging from it. She then calls to God or whoever is in charge, saying that she got Sterling ready but doesn't want to have stay there and watch while invisible. There's no response.

Sterling is walking home when the Caprice owner and some of his buddies pull up. He reminds Sterling that she bashed up his car, and he heard that Tuka died in a car accident. The owner doesn't believe her when she agrees, and one of his friends hits Sterling in the leg with a baseball bat. She collapses and screams in agony as the owner and his friends drive off, and no one hears Tuka calling for someone to help Sterling.

On the day of the invitationals, Sterling insists on running and is in the locker room as a medic wraps her knee, and Lee and Riley look on. Her grandmother wants someone to talk sense into Sterling, and Tuka watches and Sterling tells Riley that the recruiters are out there and have to see her. She insists that she and Tuka had a vision, Keeping her promise to Tuka to win the meet is the only thing keeping her sane, and cheers her on,

Sterling takes her position at the start, unwrapping her knee. She focuses and then runs, and Tuka yells at her to work. Sterling takes the lead, but then clutches at her leg in pain and falls. Tuka and the others watch as Sterling pulls herself across the finish line, gasping in pain.

Later, Sterling pulls herself up to the stairs to the top of the complex. Tuka is waiting for her, and Sterling talks to her and says that she's pissed that they can't talk. When Tuka wonders why she's stuck there to train Sterling, Sterling screams in rage and grief, saying she shouldn't have left Tuka at the Sideshow. Tuka figures she should have left with her, and they both blame themselves. Sterling figures that now she can't run so she can't talk to Tuka, but says that there's something she needs to tell her.

Tuka sits down next to Sterling, and Sterling says that she always wanted to say that they're not just friends but she needs Tuka and cares about her. They both say that they love the other, and Sterling can see and touch Tuka for the first time since Tuka's death. They start to kiss, but something pulls Tuka away as she glows with white light. She tells Sterling to never forget how much she cares, then disappears.

Sterling kneels next to Tuka's body on the street, begging her to come back. Tuka opens her eyes and tells Sterling to kiss her. Sterling does so, and they go to DJ altar and Tuka leaves her track cleats there. She says that DJ changed her life, and tells Sterling that she'll tell her the story sometime. They leave, and behind them the unseen DJ smiles and then disappears in a burst of white light.

Later at the track, Tuka and Sterling run together."

His father Michael pulls up with his father, Joe, who has a knee brace on his left leg. He sees Dylan and wonders what the heck Dylan is wearing, and Michael tells him that Dylan is Batman and made the costume for the coming Halloween.

As they go in the house, Michael suggests that Joe view having to stay with his son's family as an opportunity to spend time with Dylan and let them take care of him. Joe irritably insists that he doesn't need taking care of and says that the trainer and all the equipment for his rehab will be there the next day. Michael's wife Helen comes to greet them, and she says that they have Dylan's room made up for Joe while Dylan will sleep with his older brother, Bryce. She offers to be there if Joe wants to talk about anything since she's a grief counselor, but Joe isn't interested and insists that he isn't feeling any grief.

Joe goes to Dylan's room and finds him checking on his pet toad. Drawings of comic book characters are on the wall, and Joe comments on them and then says that he isn't feeling any better then when he got there when Dylan asks. Dylan invites Joe to read his comics if he wants, and Joe looks at the sketches Dylan has made for his own comic book. He then asks Dylan to leave and Dylan goes.

Dylan goes into Bryce's room and finds him making out on his bed with his girlfriend, Erica. Bryce tells Dylan to knock next time, and when Dylan tells him about Joe, Bryce suggests that they talk about it some other time. When Dylan tells Bryce that their mother said he's sleeping there, he soon finds himself sleeping on the couch instead. He texts Brady and says that Joe ""stole"" his bedroom, but Brady doesn't respond, and Michael comes in. Dylan claims that he likes the couch better, and Michael sits down and admits that Joe can be a bit. When Dylan tells his father that Joe is just mean, Michael says that Joe's own father had to be tough and suggests that they cut him some slack. Dylan agrees and Michael turns off the lights and leaves. Dylan then works on his own sketches under the covers, using a flashlight.

The next morning, the trainer Sybil works with Joe to see if he can lift his foot. The family leaves for the day. When Helen asks Bryce to pick up Dylan after practice, Bryce notes that his practice will last until 6:30. Joe says that he'll get Dylan and insists that he can drive.

At school, Dylan approaches Brady. Brady says that he has something he has to do rather than go out trick-or-treating with Dylan. He says that he was going to a dance, and the girl he plans to go with, Maya, walks by, saying hello. Brady apologizes to Dylan then goes after Maya.

Joe goes to the shop where he works and tells his coworkers that he's by. One of them, Kenny, wonders why he's there, and insists that he doesn't need any help. He talks to the foreman, Lance, and tells him not to hire a replacement. Joe insists that he's getting better, and Lance shows him a union contract with Joe's pension plan. Joe insists that he's not going to retire and he's the best man there, and Lance says that he can't put a man in the field who can't do the work. As Joe leaves, Lance tells him that he won't be back and Joe is going to have to take the retirement plan.

After school, Dylan sits on the steps at school and works on his sketches. Joe pulls up in the family car and tells Dylan that he had to deal with something at the shop. When Dylan says that he hates junior high, Joe says that he was a legend in high school and talks about the prank he did at the school dance. He asks Dylan what his story is and if he has friends, and Dylan explains how his friend Brady doesn't want to be around him. Joe says to hell with Brady and drives off with Dylan.

When Joe and Dylan get home, Dylan gets the mail, including a white box. The box is addressed to Joe, from Wham Comics, and a surprised Joe opens it. Inside is a plastic ring and a note from ""Dynoman"". He tells Dylan that he ordered it when he was a kid, and Dylan suggests that maybe it got lost in the mail. Joe doesn't believe it, saying that he ordered it 60 years ago from the back of a comic, and Dylan realizes that his grandfather was also into comics. The old man figures that it's a joke and Kenny is playing it on him, and tells Dylan that he probably gave the comics to Michael.

Dylan finds the comics in the garage that Michael never threw away, and Joe explains that Dynoman was a miner like Joe's dad, who was working underground and a stick of dynamite blew up and shot three radioactive rocks into his ring. Each ring gave strength, speed, and flight. Dylan wonders how the powers worked, and Joe complains that Dylan's generation always needs an explanation. Also in the comics is the Volt, Dynoman's nemesis. Dynoman saved Volt's village in Rumania from a meteor, but a chunk of debris smashed Volt's house and killed his parents. The boy vowed vengeance, found all the remnants of the meteor that had absorbed the power of Dynoman's ring, and built his helmet out of the remnants. Dylan points out that it's a pretty standard origin, and Joe says that his stories had more panache. Joe admits that he wrote a few comic stories but eventually gave it up as he grew older.

As Joe limps out, Dylan points out that the comic says that the power comes when needed. He notes that Joe needs it and suggests that he try the ring, and Joe tells Dylan to try it. The ring is too big for Dylan and he figures it's for Joe, and Joe gives in. The ring fits Joe's finger, but he tells Dylan that nothing has changed for him and the ring is a toy. Dylan sees the ring glow and says that junk doesn't just appear after and suggests that Joe hit his punching bag. Joe can't take off the ring, and tells Dylan to stop insisting because believing in something stupid isn't the way to deal with life's problems. Dylan says that it's not stupid and storms out.

Dylan goes into the house and Helen asks him what the matter is. The boy goes to his room without answering her, and Michael comes in with hamburger takeout. Helen says that it's not Indian like they planned, and Michael tells her that they're Joe's favorites. She says that Michael is always trying to impress Joe, who always criticizes him. Helen complains that Joe doesn't seem grateful, and jokingly offers to eat hamburgers for a month if Joe says thank you.

That night at dinner, everyone gathers at the table except Dylan, who eats in the living room by himself. Bryce is tossing his football and notices Joe's new ring and comments on it, and Michael tells Joe that Lance called him and mentioned the retirement package. He suggests that Joe take the package, and Joe figures that Michael believes he can't get back in. He complains that Michael isn't supporting him like he supported Michael, and Helen points out that he didn't support Michael.

Michael calls Dylan to the table, and Helen says how Lance has a lot on his plate. When Helen mentions his age, Joe says that she's not far behind him age-wise and Michael says that they're just trying to get Joe to think realistically about his future, and Joe says that he's responsible for the shop's big orders. The ring glows and Dylan notices, and Bryce slips and sends the ball flying. Joe instinctively catches it, yells that his life isn't over, and crushes the ball in his hand. Surprised, Joe and Dylan look at each other and then Joe also notices that the ring is glowing.

Joe and Dylan go out to the garage and Joe insists that there has to be a rational explanation. Dylan asks if Joe feels different and invites him to hit the bag, and figures that it's his anger that activates the ring. He starts taunting Joe, asking if he's afraid to try, and Joe punches the bag and sends it flying across the garage. Joe admits that Dylan was right, and smashes his workbench. His knee has healed, and the boy and his grandfather celebrate.

The next day, Joe goes to the shop, picks up a board, and easily carries it while asking Lance if he should clock in.

At school, Dylan tries to tell Brady what happened. Maya is sitting nearby and asks if that's Dylan, and the other students sarcastically ask Dylan to be Batman and help them out. Dylan realizes that Brady has been telling them about him and storms out, and Brady goes after him and apologizes. He says that they saw the photos of Dylan in costume, and Brady said that he was an old friend who liked to dress up. Dylan points out that Brady was laughing at him with the others and tells him to go, and Brady does.

Joe arrives home and Michael asks him about the shattered workbench. His father says that Sybil put some weights on it and it collapsed, and dismisses it at shoddy construction. Joe says that he feels fine, and he just came from the doctor who gave him a complete release. He says that he goes back to work the next day, and will be out of their hair in six days.

When he goes to Dylan's room, Joe finds Dylan on the bed. The boy says that he's ""toxic"", and shows him the Facebook page with the other kids calling him ""Dress Up Dylan"". Joe says that he'd give the ring to Dylan so he could use the powers if he could get it off, but he can't. When he offers to do anything else to help him, Dylan figures that he can by putting the principal's car on the school roof and Dylan will take credit for it. Joe tells Dylan that the kids taunting him will grow up to be losers, and Dylan should go out trick-or-treating if he wants. Dylan figures that it wouldn't be the same, and Joe offers to leave. Dylan reconsiders and says that he can go trick-or-treating with Joe. Touched, Joe agrees.

Later at the shop, Joe is working and Kenny looks on surprised. On Joe's hand, the ring glows. He tells Lance that he's taking an early lunch, then super-speeds to the junior high where Dylan is sitting by himself. Joe says that he ran there and Dylan points out a map of the best places to get candy, and figures that with Joe's speed they can hit all four the houses instead of just one or two. Joe speeds back to the shop and overhears Lance talking to a customer who has a restaurant opening in two days and they don't have the tables ready. Joe goes over and tells the woman that her tables will be ready, guaranteed. The woman accepts and leaves, and Joe tells Lance that he's got it covered.

Dylan returns home and goes to his room, and puts on his Batman costume.

Joe makes the tables at super-speed.

That night, the costumed Dylan waits for Joe to come home after work as he promised. Michael and Helen notice, and Helen says that nothing Michael can say about makes the disappointed look on Dylan's face okay. Michael goes over to Dylan and says that Dylan and Joe have both been acting different. Dylan finally says that Joe has superpowers and tries to tell Michael about Dynoman. Michael remembers Joe trying to get him into the comic when he was a kid, and Dylan finally tells him about the ring.

At the shop, Joe and the other workers have beers. Lance joins them, and Michael comes in and asks Joe what he's doing. The workers leave, and Michael tells Joe that he stood up Dylan and the boy thinks that Joe is a superhero. When Joe says that he tried to give Michael all the stuff he loved as a child, Michael tells him that he and Dylan want Joe, not ""stuff"", and Joe is screwing it up with Dylan just like he screwed it up with Michael. Joe says that he made all of the tables and lost track of time, but Michael doesn't want to hear it and says that something always came up. His father insists that he worked for Michael and his mother, but Michael says that it was always about Joe and he thought this time things would be different, but they're not. Michael tells Joe that Dylan is in his bedroom crying because Joe is with his coworkers who don't need him rather than his grandson who does. Joe tells Michael that he can fix it, but Michael says that it's too late to fix. Michael tells Joe to leave his home and goes.

Joe's knee gives out and he collapses. The ring stops glowing, and Joe manages to get up and limps out.

Dylan goes to his room and throws his costume on the floor. He throws the Dynoman comics in the garbage, then looks at the one showing Volt's origin and gets an idea. Dylan goes to the workbench and gathers the remnants, and tapes them to an old hockey mask. Once he has a helmet like Volt's, Dylan puts it on and the remnant pieces making up the lightning wings glow for a moment.

Michael returns home and tells Helen that Joe doesn't get it and he's done making Joe care about his family. Helen hugs him in sympathy, and Joe drives up and limps out. He goes to the garage to get Dylan, and finds the discarded Dynoman comic with Volt's origin. Joe realizes what Dylan has done, and discovers that the rings comes off. He drops the ring on the floor and goes to Bryce's room, and asks Bryce where Dylan is. They saw Dylan leave in his Volt costume, going to the school's Halloween costume, and Dylan said that the night would be ""legendary"". Joe realizes what Dylan meant and leaves.

At the school, Dylan watches the other kids go inside to the dance. He then pushes the principal's SUV up to the wall.

Michael goes to the garage, intending to talk to Joe. He doesn't find his father there, but finds the ring on the floor.

Joe drives go the school.

The costumed Dylan goes to the roof, and uses a rope he brought to pull the SUV up to the roof with his super-strength. He slips and the truck starts to fall, and Dylan tries to pull it back. Dylan loses his helmet, and it smashes on the pavement below. He falls into the SUV and locks the door nearest to him. Joe arrives below and sees the SUV slipping over the edge, goes up the inside stairs to the roof, and tells Dylan that he lost his powers. He tries to pull Dylan out, but falls into the truck and it goes over the edge. Michael flies up and catches it before it hits the pavement, and the ring glows on his finger.

Michael flies the SUV back to the roof and gets his son and father out. Michael realizes that Dylan was telling the truth, and explains about finding the ring. Joe hugs him and Michael hugs him back, and the SUV alarm goes off. Michael flies Joe and Dylan away as the kids come out of the dance and see the SUV on the roof. They all laugh at the principal as he realizes his SUV is on the roof.

Back at home, Joe says that they should bury the ring. He figures that none of them need the ring anymore, and Michael agrees. As Michael buries it in across the street yard, Joe tells Dylan that they should make their own superhero, and suggests that they work together. Behind them, a glowing plant grows out of the dirt where the ring is buried."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9134758/?ref_=ttep_ep4,,"When her mother awakes from a six-year coma, teenage Alia struggles to reconnect with this stranger who can't remember her old life.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Michael Dinner'],"['', '', '']",[],['apple tv'],[],"Night at St. Licci's Hospital, and the lights flicker in the coma patients' ward. The power goes out and one patient, Sara Jordan, gasps and wakes up. Sara sits up and pulls the respirator out of her mouth and throat.

Two orderlies run in a minute later to check on the patients, and find Sara on the floor. They get her back up into her bed and call in the doctor. As the EMTs and the doctor take Sara to an exam room, Dr. Mary Koh tells Sara that she'll be okay and that six years in a coma is a long time.

In the diner where she works, Alia scowls up at the flickering overhead lights, serves food to weight clusters, and then discovers that the credit card machine network is out. She goes over to where four students are eating after prom and tells them that they need to pay cash, and they run out without paying. Sara picks up the purse that one of the girls left, goes out, and holds it up, demanding payment in return for the purse. ' When the prom girl threatens to report to the diner manager that Alia stole it, Alia's coworker Cody comes out and advises them to pay. He claims that Alias will kick all of their asses, and the prom girl's date tosses some bills on the ground and walks away with his three friends. Cody picks up the money and a corsage that one girl dropped, and half-jokingly gives it to Alia. Alia tells Cody that she could have handled it, and Cody says that soon they'll be heading to LA once he buys a car to ""look LA'. When she says that they need a plan, Cody wonders why she always has to wait, and Alia says that she wants the timing to be right. He figures that the time will never be right but it'll be a start.

Alia gets a call from St. Licci's and goes to the hospital. She goes into her mother's room where Koh is checking on Sara, and is shocked when Sara doesn't recognize her. Koh draws Alia to the side and says that memory loss after a six-year coma isn't unusual, and the fact Sara is speaking is miraculous. The doctor runs a MRI on Sara, and afterward tells Alia that when Sara was brought in, she had irreversible brain damage. Now some of the damage has healed, and she's never seen anything like it. Alia asks how long it will take for Sara to recover, and Koh warns that it could be months.

Sara suddenly says that she needs to make a call. She recites a phone nu7mber and Alia calls it. The person on the other end answers and then hangs up without speaking, and Sara doesn't say anything when Alia asks who she was trying to call. Koh says that they should take it one day at a time, and Alia takes Sara's hand but Sara pulls away.

Later at home, Alia goes to her bedroom and looks at a photo of her and her mother. She then lies back and goes to sleep.

In the hospital room, Sara looks at a video on her phone that she took of a 10-year-old Alia on Christmas. The woman vaguely remembers the day, then looks up as Alia comes in. Alia realizes that Sara got the videos she sent, and Sara says that they help. The orderly talks to herself in Spanish, and Sara understands it and responds to her. Alia is surprised to learn that Sara speaks Spanish, and Sara appears surprised as well.

Later, Koh performs a physical and mental assessment on Sara. She doesn't recognize the picture for ""family"", and then says that she got a perfect score and that's enough for Koh to authorize her release. Koh notes that there are certain gaps in what is coming back to Sara, and Sara suggests that if she goes home with Alias then maybe she'll start remembering.

Koh agrees, and Alia takes Sara to the hospital cafeteria. Sara asks Alia if she has a father, calling her ""Alia"" and Alia says that she never knew him and it's always been just the two of them. Sara realizes that she upsets Alia, and Alia dismisses it as nothing and asks if she's ready to leave the hospital. A man, Wayne Wilkes, passes nearby and makes eye contact with Sara, and then disappears in the crowd. When Alia asks Sara what her rush is to leave, Sara abruptly says that she can't be there anymore and goes for a swim in the hospital pool.

Later, Alia approaches Koh and insists that Sara isn't the woman she knew as her mother. Now Sara speaks Spanish, and she always used a nickname for Alia and never called her by her given name. Koh says that Sara's memories aren't the answer, because Alia and Sara would still be total strangers. She says that it's about two people getting to know each other again.

Sara backfloats in the pool, and finds Wayne standing over here. He says that the water helps after what she's been through, and Sara gets out of the pool and says that she thought it was him. Wayne tells her that he got her call and Sara asks him what took him so long.

Alia arrives at the outside pool door and sees Sara and Wayne talking. She comes in and says that Sara's discharge papers will be ready in the morning. Wayne tells Alia that he's an old friend of Sara's from the same hometown, and Alia asks how long he'll be in town. When Wayne tells her that he'll be there as long as it takes, Alia suggests that she wants to know more about Sara when she was her age. She hugs Sara and says that she'll see her in the morning when she's discharged, then leaves. Wayne asks Sara if Alia will be a problem, and Sara says that it isn't anything she can't handle.

The next morning, Alia takes Sara to her ""temporary"" apartment, and Sara asks if Alia has school or something. Alia tells her that she already graduated and offers some sandwiches. Sara takes a bite of one, makes a face, but then says that it's just spicy. She then says that she's not hungry but could use a nap, and Alia points her to her bedroom. Sara goes in, closing the door behind her, and looks at Alia's mementos and high school trophies. She has memories of the two of them together and puts the items away, then texts Wayne and says that she needs to get away from Alia because she doesn't know how much longer she can do it. Wayne texts back, saying it won't be long.

That night, Alia looks in the bedroom and finds Sara sleeping on the bed, and muttering scientific formulas. She calls Cody and tells him her suspicions that her mother has changed, and was never scientifically-inclined before. Cody suggests that Sara was having an affair before the car accident, but Alia insists that her mother wasn't like that and all she has to do is get Sara to remember.

The next morning, Alia makes breakfast and Sara comes out of the bedroom. The girl has made a ""tasting menu"", and figures that the best way to deal with Sara is to create new memories. Alias introduces herself to her mother as if for the first time, and Sara awkwardly shakes Alia's hand. Sara introduces herself, and says that she doesn't know what she likes, and Alia invites her to try everything. She tries bacon and doesn't like it, and Alia says that she used to. Alia encourages her to take another bite, and Sara admits that it's really good and laughs. She then says that's it good but she has to get to her ""coma support group"" that she's never mentioned to Alia before. Alia suggests that they have dinner with Sara's friend Wayne, and Sara says that Wayne called earlier and said that he had to leave town. She thanks Alia for making breakfast, and Alia suggests that later they go watch a dance rehearsal for a new show like the used to.

Down on the street, Wayne picks Sara up and drives to a fenced-in farm outside of the city. Sara warns that it won't be easy getting in, and Wayne tells her that's what he has her for.

Alia waits outside the church where the dance rehearsal is, and Cody calls her. When she sees Sara across the street, Alia ignores the call and calls to her mother. Sara comes over and Alia takes a cell phone photo of the two of them together. As Alia does so, Sara sees the ribbon in Alia's hair and remembers her as a child. They go inside and see the dancers rehearsing, and after staring at them Sara looks over at Alia, who smiles at her and takes her hand.

Afterward as they walk home, Sara talk about how the dancers' bodies seemed to be free and hers feel like a trap. She asks Alia if she dances, and Alia tells her that she doesn't. As they go up to Alia's apartment, Sara says that she's glad they went and it's the most beautiful thing she's seen there. She adds ""since she woke up"" and hesitates, and Alia asks her what the matter is. Sara says that she can hear someone in the apartment and tells Alia to stay behind her, then uses Alia's keys to unlock the door and goes in with Alia behind her.

Alia turns on the light and they see Cody in the kitchen, holding an icepack to his forehead. He asks where she was, and Alia introduces her mother. Sara realizes that Cody wants some privacy and goes into her bedroom. Once they're alone, Cody tells Alia that they have to get out of town because he was selling weed and someone stole it from him. In the bedroom, Sara repeats everything that Cody says to Alia, and he tells Alia that he'll never be able to pay back his seller and they have to leave town.

Alia takes out her secret stash of money, but Cody says that it's not enough and he's not going to take her money because they need it for LA. When Alia says that she can't leave Sara, Cody insists that there's something wrong with Sara and Alia knows it. He asks Alia to support him like he's always supported her, and Alia asks if he's going to make her choose between him and Sara because he knows she can't. Disgusted, Cody walks out.

Going up to the rooftop, Alia drinks and turns as Sara comes out. She says that she's trying to understand why Alia doesn't want to leave with Cody even if Sara wasn't around. Alia tells her mother that Cody gets her, and Sara apologizes for eavesdropping. Her daughter says that she isn't who Sara thinks she is, and she lied when she said she graduated. She was in scholarship at college but got kicked out because she was alone and angry. Cody took the blame for her, saying that she was the one with a future, but she kept lashing out anyway.

Sara admits that she can't understand what Alia went through, but she knows what it's like to be alone. Alia asks if there was something before the coma that Sara never told her, and Sara tells her that before Alia came into her life, she was a bit of a loner. She says that Alia will figure out a plan and shouldn't let anyone figure it out for her. Alia thanks her, calling Sara ""mom"" for the first time since she came out of the coma.

Later, Alia is in the bedroom doing up her hair and listening to her earphones. She hears Sara talking in her sleep, looks out, and realizes that although Sara is asleep, she's saying the same lyrics as the song on Alia's player. When Alia switches her phone to a different site, Sara recites the words coming from that site. Going out to the living room, Alia takes a journal out of Sara's purse and finds pages full of written conversations.

The next day, Alia watches Sara leave and get into the waiting Wayne's truck. Alia looks up Wayne's address on the Internet and discovers that he lives in Alabama. She takes a bus to Wayne's hometown and goes to the trailer listed for him. A woman answers the door and lets Alia in, and Alia finds a photo of Mrs. Wilkes and Wayne together. Mrs. Wilkes says that Wayne always lived there in never in Chicago where Sara grew up. She explains that they grew up together and Wayne fell off a ladder while repairing a roof and went into a coma. Five months later, Wayne miraculously woke up but wasn't him. He talked in his sleep about mathematical formulas, and ran off with some woman named Lexi that he picked up at a bar. Mrs. Wilkes doesn't know anything else about Lexi.

As Alia leaves, she looks at the page she took from the journal. There's a reference to ""A. Stone"", and Alia figures the ""A"" stands for ""Alexandra"". She discovers an Alexandra Stone that miraculously woke up from a three-year coma.

Wayne and Sara go back to the farm, and Sara concentrates. She ""sees"" two government agents moving Lexi down a hall, and tells Wayne that they're transferring her that night. Wayne figures that it's their chance, and as they walk away Sara asks him what they were doing at the CDC when Lexi was caught. He tells Sara that they were gathering information, but now the program has been compromised. Sara warns that it's too soon and she's not strong enough to access all of it, but Wayne figures that it's Alia. He says that he understands because he had a wife, and the feelings of their hosts are complicated. However, Wayne tells Sara that she has to.

Sara returns to Alia's apartment and pours herself a glass of water. As she stares at the sunlight shining through the water, Alia comes in and asks where she was. Sara says that she went to a life insurance office and took out a policy, and shows it to Alia. Alia wonders why she took out a policy, and Sara tells her that if something happened to her, she wants Alia taken care of. The girl says that she saw Sara with Wayne and says that Sara has been lying to her.

Sara tells Alia that the Sara she knows is gone, and the coma changed things. She tells Alia to accept it and move on, and doesn't need a mother because she's grown up. Hurt, Alia says that she doesn't and can take care of herself, and storms out. She goes to Cody's place and says that they should go to LA. Cody asks about Sara, and Alia admits that she was stupid for thinking things could go back to the way they were. She says that she was better off on her own, and tells Cody that they should get the car and leave town.

That night, Wayne and Sara park along the route that the government agents are transporting Lexi. Once Sara senses them coming, Wayne says that they should engage. Sara concentrates and the government agent wince as a sound penetrates their brains. Wayne parks his truck across the road, blocking the convoy, and he gets out, holds out his hand, and telekinetically knocks the lead transport into the air. It slides to a halt, and soldiers get out of the other two transports.

Sara steps out, concentrates, and the soldiers drop their guns and freeze. Wayne walks past them and frees Lexi. He and Sara then take Lexi to a field filled with radio telescopes. Lexi warns that the agents gave her a drug and her body isn't responding well to it, and senses that the broadcast is going live in a few minutes. Wayne tells Lexi to go first, and Sara realizes that they're attached. Lexi says that she'll see them on the other side and her occupier's energy form leaves Lexi's body.

Wayne warns that the ""real"" Lexi can't survive long in Earth's atmosphere, and the energy form bounces along the antennas and then shoots into space. Sara realizes that the human Lexi is no longer breathing, and Wayne tells her that they both knew what would happen originally would happen once they left their host bodies. Wayne says that the comatose patients were being kept alive by people who couldn't let them go, and it's time to go back to where they belong. Sara refuses and tells Wayne to go without her.

The possessed human tells Sara that she's not the real Sara and she's not a mother. Wayne says that Alia will figure it out eventually, and Sara says that she doesn't want to do what they do. Slamming her telekinetically against a nearby fence, Wayne says that they can't leave a trace because it's against the rules, and that's why they sent the alien possessing Sara's body. Sara telekinetically knocks him back, and he recovers and warns her that they'll never leave her alone. She turns and walks away, and Wayne realizes that they're out of time and transmits his energy form into space.

Alia and Cody break into the diner officer and Alia opens the safe with the combination she knows. An alarm goes off when she opens the safe door, and she grabs some of the money. The two of them run outside, and Cody's seller Jasper is waiting for them with a gun. Jasper tells Cody to hand over the money they stole, and Sara arrives and telekinetically takes control of Jasper and tells him to leave Alia alone. She then throws him through the diner window, turns to Alia and Cody, and Alia realizes that Sara isn't her mother.

As Sara starts to speak, Jasper recovers and shoots her from behind. He runs off, and Cody calls 911 while Sara apologizes to Alia. Alia begs her mother not to leave her, and sends Cody into the restaurant to get resuscitation paddles. He gets them and Alia shock Sara to start her heart pumping. The alien energy form emerges from Sara's body then enters the nearby electrical wires and then into the paddles.

Alia applies the paddles to Sara's body, and all the nearby lights go out. The real Sara revives and calls Alia by her nickname, and asks what's going on. The alien energy form leaves the paddles and dissipates in the atmosphere, and Alia realizes that her mother is unconscious. The police and the government agents arrive with EMTs, who take Sara to the hospital.

A few weeks later, Alia and Sara are packing up Alia's apartment. Alia has Sara sign her application to repeat her senior year, and Sara assures her daughter that she's more than she could ever dream of. Alia thanks her for the support. Sara finds the photo of the two of them that Alia took before the rehearsal and doesn't remember it, and Alia assures her mother that she loved it. The girl then puts the photo of the two of them up on the refrigerator."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8451212/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,"When a WWII pilot crashes in modern-day Ohio, a young widow and her stepson are swept up in his search for home.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Mark Mylod'],"['', '', '']",[],['apple tv'],[],"Mary Ann Whitaker and her stepson Elijah drive through the Ohio woods to her deceased husband's sister's house. Elijah is in the back seat with his video game on Mary Ann's phone, and Mary Ann tries to make conversation. When Elijah doesn't respond, Mary Ann tells him to give her phone back and talk to her. She talks about the local zoo and says that she knows how much Elijah likes them, and he says that he doesn't like them without his recently deceased father. Mary Ann admits that she misses her husband as well.

The woman misses the turn to her sister-in-law's house because the GPS it out, and when she asks for a map Elijah notices that she has a letter in her purse with his name on it. Mary Ann quickly takes the letter from her stepson and refuses to discuss it, and makes a U turn. Behind the SUV, the mailboxes by the side of the road shake.

As Mary Ann drives back along the highway, the windshield suddenly shatters. Mary Ann brakes to a halt, and a World War II fighter flies over them and crashes in a nearby creek. Elijah gets out and runs over, and Mary Ann runs after him. Sher calls 911 and reports a plane crash, and Elijah spots someone in the cockpit. Mary Ann goes down and tries to open the canopy, finally getting it open. Lt. Theodore Cole climbs out as the plane burns, but refuses to go without a photograph on his control panel.

Once they're clear of the burning wreck, Elijah runs over and hugs Mary Ann. Theodore thanks Mary Ann for her rescue and introduces himself, saying he's with the 2nd Squadron. He asks if they're British or Dutch, and wonders what they're doing in Burma. Elijah tells him that they're in Ohio, and Ted says that he was just in a dogfight over a ridge... that isn't there. Ted sees a nearby water tower for Dayton, and remembers that he grew up near Dayton. Overhead, a storm ""eye"" forms in the clouds.

Mary Ann and Elijah take Ted to the nearby hospital in Bradford, and Sheriff Parker gets their story. When she repeats Ted's claim of being shot down near Rangoon, Elijah asks if it's possible that the pilot came from World War II. Parker says that Ted is delusional from a head injury. There's no registered tail numbers. Elijah looks over at the hospital room where Ted is, and asks his stepmother for money for the vending machine. She gives him a credit card because she's out of cash, and tells Parker that Elijah is her stepson

Elijah goes into Ted's room, slipping past unseen by the officer on guard, and Ted grabs the boy's wrist when Elijah looks at his dog tags. Panicked, Ted asks Elijah where he is, and Elijah asks if he's a bad guy. Ted says that he was fighting bad guys and confirms that he's a ""real soldier"". The pilot wonder what happened and says that it was Christmas Eve 1941, and Elijah tells him that it's September. He asks Elijah to help him escape, and offers the boy a Whiz candy bar from his jacket pocket. Ted explains that his wife gave it to him as a good luck charm every time before he flies. Elijah has never heard of a Whiz candy bar and says that he's been told not to take candy from strangers.

An officer sees Elijah in the room and pounds on the door that the boy locked, and Ted asks Elijah to find his friend, Sheriff Simmons, and tell him that his buddy Ted is in trouble. Elijah promises to do so, and the officer and an orderly break in. The officer slams Ted down on his bed and the orderly gives the pilot a sedative.

As Mary Ann and Elijah drive to the house, Elijah tells his stepmother what Ted said. Mary Ann figures that Ted was crazy, but Elijah wonders if Ted was telling the truth. He's checked and confirmed that they haven't made Whiz bars in 30 years, and says that Ted needs their help. Mary Ann irritably brakes to a halt, then drives back to Bradford to check with Simmons.

Behind them, a group of government cars and military vehicles arrive at the creek. The lead agent, Bill Kaminski, calls and says that no one should talk to Ted and that they have seven hours to do ""it"" sand can't afford any screw-ups. Kaminski tells the officers and firefighters on the scene that the road is closed until further notice and they should clear the crash site 10 miles in either direction. He then looks at the eye through a piece of scanning equipment, and his aide Nina Bowman tells him that he's done it dozens of times and his equipment isn't going to tell them anything new. Kaminski tells her to get Ted and Bowman leaves.

Mary Ann and Elijah arrive at the Bradford police station as Chief McClarty learns about Kaminski's order. They ask for Simmons and McClarty says that there's no Simmons there. Elijah looks at a display case, sees a photograph, and open the case, taking out a signed Johnny Bench baseball. The boy ""accidentally"" drops it and takes the photo when McClarty gets the baseball. Mary Ann takes Elijah outside, and he shows her the photograph from 1938. Ted is in it, and Mary Ann insists that it couldn't be Ted.

In the hospital, Ted wakes up and looks out the window, and sees Army soldiers pulling up outside. He knocks out the orderly when he comes in to give Ted another sedative, takes the orderly's uniform, and sneaks out as Bowman and her men tell Parker and his officers that they'll handle it. Once he finds his clothing, Ted sneaks out, while Bowman finds the unconscious orderly in Ted's hospital bed. Outside, Ted stares at the 21st century technology in surprise, breaks into a car, and sets off the alarm. Inside the hospital, Bowman sees him and calls her men to the parking lot. They run out just in time to see Ted drive off on a motorcycle that he's stolen.

At the crash site, government techs are lifting the fighter out of the creek and going through the water to find all the pieces. The ground shakes and a tech, Milburg, tells Kaminski that they have an anomaly. Kaminski isn't surprised, Milburg tells Kaminski that he knows the eye is a ""doorway"" and they have to send everything back through, and asks what happened if they don't. Kaminski just tells him to fix the plane.

Mary Ann stops at a gas station, and Elijah insists that the man in the photograph is Ted, not his ancestor, and that Ted has somehow traveled through time. The boy insists that time travel pulls someone to where they belong, like destiny. As Mary Ann checks the overheating engine, Elijah grabs the letter his stepmother took earlier and reads it. He gets out of the SUV and complains that his new elementary school, Jefferson, is in Burlington nearby, where his aunt lives. Elijah thought they were moving to San Diego together, and realizes that Mary Ann is going there by herself and ""abandoning"" him. Mary Ann explains that she promised her husband she'd always do what was best for Elijah. Elijah wonders if he's been too much trouble, and his stepmother tells him that he hasn't and it isn't about him. She figures that the best chance for Elijah isn't with her, and begs him not to fight her on it as he gets back in the SUV.

Mary Ann gets in as well and tells Elijah that everything will be okay and his aunt will take good care of him and that's what matters. Elijah wonders who will take care of Mary Ann. As they pull out, Ted is coming down the highway and wipes out on his motorcycle rather than hit them. Elijah figures that it's destiny, and asks Ted if he's in the photo. Ted confirms that he is and points out Simmons, and Elijah tells Mary Ann that Ted needs their help. Mary Ann gives in and asks Ted where he was going, and he says that he was going home to get to his wife Pauline. Police sirens sound in the distance, approaching, and Mary Ann tells Ted to get in the SUV with them.

Following Ted's directions, Mary Ann drives to his old home. He goes in and calls to Pauline, and a woman comes in and asks if she can help him. When Ted says that he's Pauline's husband, the woman asks if he's a little young to be her husband. Elijah and Mary Ann come in, and the woman--a nurse--asks what is going on. Elijah says that Ted is a friend of Pauline's, and the nurse asks Ted if he wants to see hello to Pauline. She says that Pauline is at her pottery class and should be back in a few minutes.

Ted looks at the wedding photos of himself on the wall, and Pauline with her second husband and their children. He goes outside to wait, and Mary Ann looks up Ted's obituary online. It says that Ted crashed on the day he came through the eye--the rift--and was shot and killed while trying to evade capture.

A newscast on the TV says that Elijah has been abducted, and Elijah and Mary Ann see it. The nurse sees it as well and goes to call the police, and police cars approach. Ted comes back in to warn them, and then goes out the back door only to see the soldiers approaching. He closes the back door as Kaminski calls over a loudspeaker for Ted to come out. Ted comes out, hands up, and Kaminski and Bowman approach him and Kaminski says that they're just there to get Ted back where he belongs. The ground shakes and Bowman says that it's a seismic tremor caused by Ted being there. Kaminski explains that Ted has traveled into the future and they need to hurry if Ted is going to go back to his own time.

Elijah runs out and tells Ted that he died in Burma, and leads Ted to the SUV. The others run over and Mary Ann calls to Elijah to get out as Ted locks the doors. Ted drives through the neighboring backyards and the soldiers pursue him, and Ted finds an old moonshiners' road that he remembers. They lose their pursuers but a tire goes out.

Ted and Elijah get out, and Elijah says that the chase was epic. Seeing something across a nearby river, Ted runs over and finds an old house. Elijah follows him, and Ted tells him that it's the place where he and Pauline last danced before he shipped out. Ted tells Elijah that he never said goodbye out of superstition, and asks Elijah what his obit said. Elijah explains how it said that Ted crashed and was killed evading capture. As they walk, Ted says that he doesn't belong there and maybe he should go back, while Elijah belongs with Mary Ann. The boy says that his stepmother just wants to drop him off with his aunt, and he and Ted both have nowhere to go.

Elijah says that they have to keep moving, but Ted wonders what the point is because Pauline moved on and lived her whole life with someone else. He wonders if he has to die, but Elijah insists that he can't. Ted wonders why it's so important to the boy that he lives, and Elijah shows Ted a picture of his father and explains that he died in the war in Afghanistan a year ago. The pilot says that he's sorry, but the world has nothing for him.

The two fugitives sit down on a bench overlooking the river, and Elijah suggests that there's a way Ted can get his life back with Pauline. Ted doesn't believe him, but Elijah suggests that he go back with a Kevlar vest so the enemy soldiers can't hurt him. The boy figures that's why the rift brought Ted there, to give him a second chance.

That night, Kaminski and his men take Mary Ann to a hangar. The techs are reassembling the crashed fighter there, and Kaminski tells Mary Ann that if anyone can find Elijah, it's Mary Ann. Mary Ann refuses to help them, figuring that Kaminski plans to send Ted back to die. He tells her that there's more at stake then she realizes, but Mary Ann doesn't believe him.

Elijah and Ted walk back, and Ted says that he doesn't want to survive because Pauline moved on. When Elijah wonders how he knows, Ted explains that on his and Pauline's first date, they found a good luck charm in a Crackerjack box. When they bought their house, Pauline pinned the charm to the mantle. It wasn't there when they were there earlier, and Ted figures that Pauline doesn't want to remember him.

Kaminski tells Mary Ann that the techs are restoring the fighter to what it was so that it can fly and they can send it and Ted back. The agents shows Mary Ann the sites of earthquakes and explains that they were all caused by rifts when things that came through them weren't returned. Many global catastrophes have been caused by the rifts, and if they can send whatever came through back, nothing happens. Convinced, Mary Ann tells them that Elijah has her phone.

Elijah takes Ted to a closed Army surplus store in town, and Ted tries to jimmy the lock. It's all steel and he can't.

Bowman drives Mary back into town with the soldiers, and Mary Ann asks Bowman how many times they've failed to close the rifts successfully. Sometimes Kaminski figures that they've missed something tiny, but Bowman figures that the rift has a will and it does what it does for a reason. The rift always stays open for exactly eleven hours, and she thinks something needs to happen in that time. However, Bowman has no idea what Ted needs to do.

Ted and Elijah hear the approaching sirens and run to a nearby railyard. A helicopter crew spots them and calls in the others, but Mary Ann asks Kaminski for the chance to talk to Ted first. Kaminski agrees and Mary Ann goes over. Ted agrees to go back if he has a weapon and protection, but Mary Ann tells him that he can't fight and the rift has happened before. If Ted doesn't go back the way that he came through, everything in ten miles would die. Elijah doesn't believe it and tells Ted that they're lying to him, but Mary Ann grabs her stepson and tells Ted that he has to go through.

Ted accepts his destiny, but Mary Ann says that the rift brought him there for a reason. Ted wonders what the reason could be, and tells him that he thinks he knows. They go back to Pauline's house and Kaminski gives Ted five minutes. Ted goes inside and finds Pauline at her kitchen table working on a puzzle. He hesitantly approaches her and greets her, and she stares at him and smiles. Ted apologizes for never saying goodbye, and figures that she moved on and forgot about him, and says that he loved her, always has, and always will.

The pilot says that he has to go, and Pauline shows him the charm that she wears on a chain around her neck. Ted invites her to dance one more time, and Pauline agrees. She hesitantly does so and Ted assures her that he's got her... and they dance. Kaminski comes in to get Ted, and Ted says goodbye to Pauline.

As Ted goes to his fighter, Mary Ann and Elijah are waiting. Elijah hugs the pilot, who says the boy will be fine, and asks for a moment alone with Mary Ann. Ted talks about California and says that Elijah is lonely, and the boy told him that Mary Ann is dropping Elijah off in Indiana. Mary Ann says that all she sees is her dead husband when she looks at Elijah. Ted figures that the rift brought him there because Mary Ann and Elijah are there, and figures that he was a pilot who died in a war just like her husband was. He figures Mary Ann knows what her husband is trying to tell her, and Mary Ann looks over at Elijah.

Kaminski wishes Ted luck. Realizing that he forgot something, Ted asks Elijah for the candy bar back. Elijah admits that he ate it and gives Ted the empty wrapper. It's too late to evacuate the area, but Ted that the rift isn't about taking a candy bar but doing what it want them do. He insists that their plan will work and gets in his fighter, and he flies up into the rift, looking at his photo of Pauline. The rift closes behind him and disappears, and the techs applaud in relief. Mary Ann and Elijah hug and walk away,

The next day, Mary Ann and Elijah drive to San Diego... together. Elijah looks up at the sky and smiles."

Fred feigns illness so that he and Barney can get out of ""opera night"" with the girls and use the Flyer to go bowling instead.",[],Not Rated,Release date,"['Joseph Barbera', 'William Hanna']","['', '', '']",[],"['bowling', 'paperboy', 'sunday newspaper', 'hammock', 'golf', 'golf ball', 'golf club', 'sunday', 'invention', 'contraption', 'flying machine', 'business partner', 'top hat', 'ticket', 'fake injury', 'bowling team', 'reference to pagliacci', 'bowling alley', 'vending machine', 'opera', 'going to the opera', 'payphone', 'fake mustache', 'fake accent', 'fake german accent', 'pretending to be sick']",[],"Fred is trying to get some sleep in his hammock in his backyard. He hears pounding coming from his neighbor Barney's yard. When Fred goes over to see what the ruckus is, he finds Barney working on a strange contraption that resembles a helicopter. Barney says that when the pilot pedals hard enough, the machine will fly. Fred is skeptical and dismissive and tells Barney to knock off the racket while he's trying to rest.

Later, Barney flies past Fred in the 'copter, showing how it works. Fred is immediately intrigued, believing that if the invention works, it will be a profitable business venture for them both. Fred immediately appoints himself president of the new company & Barney the Vice President in Charge of Production. Fred names the contraption the ""Flintstone Flyer"" over Barney's desire to call it the Barney Copter.

Fred's first self-appointed duty is to test out the helicopter himself. He pedals madly but can't get enough lift to take off because of his weight. Though Barney tries to warn him, Fred goes over a cliff and crashes. He's later seen in his house on the couch while Wilma watches him closely. Barney stops by for a visit and reminds Fred that they need to be at the bowling alley tonight for an important match. However, Barney has forgotten that the two of them promised to take Wilma and Barney's wife Betty to the opera that night as well.

Just as the two couples are leaving for the opera, Fred feigns a convulsion attack, a delayed symptom of his accident. Wilma wants to stay home with Fred but Fred insists they go without the boys, Barney volunteering to take care of Fred at home. Wilma & Betty will be taking the only car available, leading Fred to believe they have no way to get to the match. Barney suggests they use his helicopter. Fred scoffs at first, but Barney tells him he's improved the design so it can carry a heavier load. After their wives have left, the two fly off in the helicopter and make it to the bowling alley. They enjoy a night of competition.

At the opera, Wilma feels guilty about leaving Fred behind. She tries to call from a pay phone in the same bowling alley Fred and Barney are at. When there's no answer at home, she suggests they drive home to check on the boys. Barney spots their wives and they hide. On the way out, Wilma and Betty spot Barney and Fred. Fred grabs some bristles from a nearby broom and the two use them as fake mustaches. Wilma and Betty hit them both and then apologize profusely when they believe they've hit a couple of strangers. Talking in angry European accents, they continue their ruse and fool their wives, who leave. Betty and Wilma decide to go home and check on the duo. When Barney cheerfully suggests they continue bowling, Fred tells them they have to get home before their wives or their cover will be blown.

They fly home in the copter, overtaking Betty and Wilma, whom they see driving home. When Betty and Wilma arrive, they find Fred in bed still looking ill and Barney sweetly reading bedtime stories to him. Wilma & Betty remark quietly that they shouldn't have doubted their husbands. Suddenly, Barney whirls on them, still wearing his mustache and scolds them in the same voice he used in the bowling alley. They're both chased out of the house after a minor scuffle and jump in the whirlygig and take off. Betty & Wilma decide to wait them out, playing cards until the wee hours when they notice that Barney is growing very tired of pedaling and will have to land soon."

He puts the bag down near the gate of his house and jumps over the fence, not noticing that a pouch from the bag was left behind. Fred is eager to make dinner; he'd bought a couple of giant dinosaur steaks and was looking forward to some grilling. When he checks the bag, he sees a hole in the bottom and can't find the meat. He catches the scent of steaks grilling. Barney cheerfully tells Fred he's grilling a couple of steaks himself. Fred immediately suspects Barney took his package and jumps the fence, battling with Barney. Wilma finds the package Fred dropped. Barney demands Fred hand over the steaks he'd taken and Fred slams them down on Barney's head, saying it's for the next thing Barney does wrong.

Barney and Fred continue their minor feud, with Barney asking Wilma for the return of his ladder. He takes it, not realizing Fred was using it to repair his roof and Fred crashes to the ground. He chases Barney, once again jumping the fence and falls into a large pit on Barney's property. Barney explains that he's putting in a swimming pool. Fred gets an idea; if they build the pool across their property line, they can share the expense. Fred chisels a plan of the pool, with a diving board at each end. Barney is reluctant but Fred schmoozes him, saying Barney is getting half a pool for free. Fred orders Barney to start digging.

As things turn out, Barney handles nearly all of the physical work. When the pool is finished and filled, the two jump into it from their respective diving boards, smashing into each other in mid-air and sinking beneath the water. Wilma and Betty fish them both out. The two neighbors soon discover that a shared pool has it's hangups: they don't notify each other when they want to have guests and the pool is crowded. Barney wants to practice fishing with a bow and arrow and accidentally punctures Fred's flotation ring. Fred becomes fed up, even when Barney reminds him that he's caused trouble with the pool as well. Fred calls him an ingrate and puts up a fence to reinstate the property line. Wilma is dismayed to see them feuding but Fred brushes off her concern saying they can both use their halves of the pool in relative privacy. When Fred jumps in the pool, he smashes on the bottom. Barney tells him he took out his half of the water.

Wilma and Betty order their husbands to stop fighting. Fred has to take the fence down and Barney fills the pool again. Fred overhears Wilma talking to Betty about Barney throwing a pool-warming party and explodes. Wilma tells him in a firm tone not to cause any trouble. Fred has an idea; he'll call a friend of his, Charlie, and have him pose as a cop and break up the party, citing noise violations. While he eagerly awaits the party and Charlie's interference, he answers the door. Barney is standing there with a cake and Wilma tells Fred the party was for Fred's birthday. Fred melts and hugs Barney.

The party soon becomes noisy and raucous, prompting a nearby neighbor to call the police. The police arrive and a short cop tells everyone they have to quiet down. Fred, believing the cop is Charlie, begins to antagonize him, pulling his cap over his face and giving him a dunk when the cop threatens to arrest him. Moments later, Charlie shows up, telling Fred he couldn't get the police costume. Fred is arrested and taken to jail. Barney visits him and brings him a slice of his birthday cake.

After Fred is released, he and Barney go home and decide to use the pool again. Fred jumps off his diving board and smashes into a bucket at the bottom; Barney needed to clean the pool, so he'd drained it"

He asks Barney to meet him at a music store where he reveals his plan to buy Wilma a very special gift: a new ""Stoneway"" piano. Fred's friends often tease him about forgetting his anniversary every year and the salesman in the music store is no exception. Fred asks about the quality of the piano and Barney offers to test it out by playing a tune on it that turns into a duet with the salesman. Fred is quickly annoyed and yells at them both, reminding the salesman he wants to buy the piano. The salesman tells him the price is $1,500. Fred only has $50 that he won in a contest.

Fred leaves the story with Barney, disappointed. They hear a voice nearby asking them if they want to purchase a piano. Fred is taken immediately by the shady character, who identifies himself as ""Eighty-Eight Fingers Louie"". He shows them a Stoneway just like the one he wanted for Wilma. When Fred tells him that he only has $50 for it, Louie eagerly accepts. Fred has Barney do the heavy lifting and running while resting the piano on the back of his car to get it home.

They hide the piano behind Fred's garage and agree to wait until midnight to sneak it into Fred's house. Fred goes to sleep and when Barney tries to wake him outside his bedroom window, he ends up throwing a large stone which hits Fred in the face, temporarily stunning him.

They make several attempts to move the piano inside without making enough noise to wake Wilma. Barney ends up doing most of the heavy lifting while Fred supervises. When the piano is dropped on Barney's foot, Fred grabs him before he can scream in pain and stuffs him into a mailbox down the street, containing the noise. It happens a second time. (A hapless mailman opens the box, letting Barney's screams of pain escape, scaring him.) When they try tying a rope to it to drag it in through an upper window, the piano falls on Barney, crushing him. During these failed operations, Fred also has to run back and forth from the piano to his bed to allay any worries from the half-wakened Wilma.

Fred finally makes the decision to bring the piano in through the front door. Barney finds that it won't fit and it gets stuck. Fred says he'll throw his weight at it, over Barney's objection. The piano rolls over Barney, rumbles through the house past Wilma, who wakes up again and is convinced by Fred that she was having an nightmare. When Fred finds Barney, he's lying injured outside the house and tells Fred the piano is sailing down the street. Fred catches it and leaps on top but realizes he can't stop it. A police officer on a motorcycle catches up and orders Fred to stop, which he does. At the police station, Fred tries to explain that he bought the piano from Eighty-Eight Fingers Louie and just wanted to surprise his wife. The judge refuses to believe Fred's story and assumes he's Eighty-Eight Fingers Louie and will have to go to jail. However, the judge has a slight change-of-heart when he realizes his own anniversary is the next day & that he has to run out to buy a gift for his wife. He sends Fred home with the piano and a small crew of policemen to help him get it into the house.

Wilma is awakened by the sounds of music and singing. In the living room, Barney is playing a happy anniversary song to the tune of the William Tell Overture while Fred and the police crew sing along. Wilma is thrilled with her gift until the cop that arrested Fred tells him that he has to go to jail. Wilma is distraught and Fred says he'll explain things later when the police get a radio call from their superiors saying that the real Eighty-Eight Fingers Louie has been caught. Fred is let go but still can't keep the piano. Wilma assures him she's happy with him for trying and for remembering their anniversary."
