The men begin to bicker as they drink, which catches the attention of Matt while he sits with Doc and Kitty.

The fight turns physical with Jerry besting Andy easily. The Marshal comes and breaks up the fight and takes Jerry to jail. He asks Jerry why he was picking a fight with a store owner like Andy. Jerry only offers up that it's personal. Matt sets Jerry's bail at $25. Andy enters the jail stating that the fight was his fault and that he doesn't want to press charges for assault. He ends up paying Jerry's bail and he is released.

Next, we see Jerry on his horse and appears to be heading out of town. He is stopped by Andy on foot and Jerry dismounts and the men begin to argue again. Andy offers to pay $600 if Jerry will just let their past issue go. Jerry refuses the money for his silence. Andy draws on Jerry, but Jerry is faster and kills Andy. The town's s people prevent Jerry from leaving the scene and Matt comes to investigate. The towns folks want to string up Andy, but Matt says he gets a trial.

Back at the jail, Jerry tells Matt that Andy had a gun and that somebody must have picked it up. Jerry comes clean about the history between him and Andy. He explains how Andy is a Quantrill Raider, mentioning his tattoo. He continues that The Quantrill killed his father in front of him and took his girl.

Matt looks in the street for the gun. He notices Belle a hostess at the bar who went home early in a window above the street. He goes up and tries to get her to tell him what she saw, but she won't talk.

The next scene is at the coroner's inquiry with Doc, Matt, Jerry and the township. Jerry explains how The shooting was self defense and as part of the Quantrill raiders Andy killed his father and took his woman a decade ago.

Jerry is set free and in the closing scene we see Jerry leaving town and Belle is looking out the window at him. Jerry calls up to her using her name back when she was his girl a decade ago before the raid. She tell's him that girl is dead. Jerry continues to ride out of town."

Slow Horses begins with: ""how River Cartwright slipped off the fast track and joined the slow horses"", a failure that seems to have had truly catastrophic consequences. To begin we are with River Cartwright, played by Jack Lowden. He's at a London Airport (not a railway station as written), earpiece in, keeping an eye on a suspect. James 'Spider' Webb, is the one in his ear, guiding him, feeding him intel as well as giving orders which are coming from Diana Taverner (know as Lady Di) played by Kristin Scott Thomas). They're telling him to 'hold position', don't go in, they wait and wait and then tell him to go. By this time the suspect has begun to make his way onto the plane so River gives chase bringing him down prior to boarding, only to find that this isn't the man. River is asked to confirm the sighting of the suspect, he does so, saying, ""blue shirt, white t-shirt"", Spider is confused, he says it's the other way round...They get back on CCTV and find the real suspect, making his way towards the train station at the airport. River gives chase, again, barging people out of the way, roughly in some cases. He reaches the true suspect but is too late, the man detonates his back-pack. (River is, in fact, convinced that the slip-up wasn't really his, and that he was actually set up -- a lingering question that continues to play a role in the story.)

Meet Jackson Lamb, Gary Oldman ("" Darkest Hour"", "" Killers Anonymous ""), head of the Slough House arm of MI5. This is where Spooks who have majorly f*cked up in their careers end up, with little to no hope of ever getting out. Lamb doesn't seem to care anymore, he's obviously intelligent, obviously knew his stuff, maybe still does, but he's been left to rot looking after these f*ck ups, maybe even himself. River is now shifting through rubbish on the office floor, we don't know how long has passed, but we do learn that it was a training exercise, though had it been real it would have resulted in hundreds dead, more injured and millions in damage. Catherine Standish (played by Saskia Reeves), Lamb's assistant, asks him what on Earth he's looking for, but he doesn't know, just doing as he's told. Lamb later says he's looking for the remnants of a once promising career. Another agent from Slough House, Sid Baker (played by Olivia Cooke) is sitting in a cafe. She distracts a reporter, Robert Hobden (Played by Paul Hilton), and swipes the contents of his laptop. Taverner wants Sid to bring the laptop with the contents of the USB stick on to her. But it ends up being River, who has a run-in with Spider whom he blames for him now being in Slough House. On the way to HQ, Regents Park, River opens the Flashbox and copies the files onto his own USB. There's nothing on the USB, just PI to many decimal places. River goes to see his grandfather David Cartwright (Played by Jonathan Pryce, the one who pulled some strings to keep him in MI5, to ask him about the journalist. He doesn't know much, but it seems like he knows more. In fact, things fortunately did not go as spectacularly wrong as the first impression suggests -- but River did slip up badly, and it's more than enough to pretty much destroy his career. River comes with a secret service pedigree, raised by a grandfather, David Cartwright, 'the O.B.', who was clearly an old hand in the game. (Possibly, too, he still exerted enough influence that River wasn't simply fired for his mistake.) In Leeds a standup comedian is telling edgy jokes, mainly about religion, he's white but it's his friend who is writing the jokes, he tells his friend he'll confuse people by laughing at the muslim jokes. He's being watched though, but is it the comedian or the friend?

This is a fabulous introduction to Slow Horses, you are left in no doubt that everyone in that office has a back story, something has gone wrong in their lives and that's lead them to be in this decrepit sh*t hole of an office.

Some seem to just get on with it, not be that bothered by it and try to make the best of it. River doesn't seem like one of those, he desperately wants to be back in the action and he's going to do whatever he can to make it happen.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8746484/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"Zombies are the monsters of the 21st century, and America's major contribution to horror. What set off zombie fever? All roads lead to George Romero, who made zombies a metaphor for social ills.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Kurt Sayenga'],[''],[],['zombie horror'],[],"Fast zombies, slow zombies, comedy zombies, teen zombies: zombies are everywhere. What set off this zombie fever?

Undead ghouls have been around for decades, but the debut of The Walking Dead in 2010 saw them explode into popular culture. To almost everyone's surprise, a horror series became the most popular show on television. But without George Romero and Night of the Living Dead (1968), there would be no Walking Dead. Night of the Living Dead lay the template for every zombie film that followed with its simple plot: six people trapped in a farmhouse, surrounded by the flesh-eating undead, fight zombies - and each other. The film pushed boundaries with its graphic depictions of gore and viscera, and also startled audiences with its potent social commentary about American racial tensions.

Every horror subgenre seems to go through cycles of popularity. In the 1990s and early 2000s, zombies had virtually disappeared from popular culture. Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead (2004) brought them back, bigger than ever. Shaun is hilarious and scary, using the zombie apocalypse as an allegory for young British people feeling lost in a changing society. Right down to its title, Shaun of the Dead is a tribute to what any horror fan will tell you is the greatest zombie movie of all time: Dawn of the Dead (1978). A potent mix of horror, satire, and groundbreaking special effects with a huge cast, Dawn of the Dead was the first depiction of a full-scale zombie apocalypse. And once again, Romero used horror to comment on American values: this time, by setting his protagonists against zombies wandering aimlessly through a mall, he took on capitalism.

Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later... (2002) revised Romero's influential model by letting fast-moving zombies loose on the fast moving 20th century. 28 Days Later... presented a disturbingly plausible scenario: an illness spreading like wildfire turns humans into rabid, homicidally angry zombies. Its scenes of a deserted London and violent military survivalists rang chillingly true in the post-9/11 world.

But there is one other class of zombie: the deliberately re-animated corpse. Frankenstein's Monster, the most famous member of the walking dead, stands in for society's outsiders: he is stigmatized, feared, yet sympathetic. Frankenstein's (1931) direct descendant is 1985's Re-Animator, which re-imagines the zombie film as a wildly transgressive horror comedy about medical students who create a serum that brings the dead back to life. Re-Animator had heads rolling around like bowling balls, but it was also a meditation on the human desire to conquer death. That same year, George Romero crafted what he hoped to be the zombie film to end all zombie films: Day of the Dead (1985). In Day of the Dead's military-ruled world, the protagonists hunker down and husband their resources, trying to shut out the world; things do not go well for them. The makeup effects pioneered by Tom Savini and Greg Nicotero in Day of the Dead led directly to the pioneering work that we see today on The Walking Dead, the show that brought realistic horror to the small screen. The Walking Dead premiered as the world dealt with the effects of the 2008 mortgage crisis: a time when people were forced out of their homes and cultural anxieties and divisiveness were at an all time high. The dread of societal collapse hasn't gone away, and The Walking Dead's popularity endures.

Interviewees include: Stephen King, Quentin Tarantino, Tom Savini, Greg Nicotero, Norman Reedus, Max Brooks, Edgar Wright, John Landis, Stuart Gordon, Ernest Dickerson, Josh Hartnett, Leonard Maltin, Jack Black, Rob Zombie, Bryan Fuller, Elijah Wood, Mick Garris, Diablo Cody, Joe Hill, Ryan Turek, and Tananarive Due."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8746482/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"Slasher films killed in the '80s, but their violence, perceived misogyny, and endless sequels almost ended the genre. Supernatural killers Chucky and Freddy saved them from extinction.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Kurt Sayenga'],[''],[],[],[],"The most extreme form of horror films, slashers have been vilified since they first came on the scene. But they have also been tremendously popular. The worst of them can still be entertaining; the best of them tell us brutal truths about ourselves, our fears, and our secret desires. Over two episodes, Eli Roth and all-star lineup of horror film creators and critics explore how and why slashers scare, attract, and anger audiences.

It all started with Psycho (1960). Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece changed the horror genre's typical setting from castles in far-off Europe to small-town America, and its monster from a pale aristocrat in a cape to the boy next door. Psycho's shower scene - perhaps the most famous scene in cinematic history - showed that the combination of an editor cutting film and a knife cutting flesh could terrify audiences and make a fortune at the box office. Psycho paved the way for the brutality of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), in which Tobe Hooper channeled his rage over the Vietnam War, the displacement of American workers, and the brutal conditions in meat slaughterhouses into a documentary-style nightmare of redneck psychosis. The spirit of these films led to John Carpenter's landmark Halloween, which turned slashers into an international phenomenon. Halloween marked the debut of Scream Queen Jamie Lee Curtis, the first great ""final girl.""

Halloween inspired legions of imitators, including Friday the 13th (1980), the first slasher to emphasize ""creative kills"" and high body counts. The blockbuster success of Friday the 13th led to a glut of slashers that were adored by fans but hated by feminist activists and movie critics. No movie spawned more hatred than Maniac (1980), a painfully realistic film about a loser who viciously murders and scalps prostitutes. Maniac and its ilk led to protests outside theaters and editorials proclaiming that slasher movies caused an uptick of violence against women. At the same time, a study showed that 55% of the slasher movie audience was made up of women. (In the episode, young feminist critics reclaim these movies for accurately depicting the anxieties of women forced to live in a world filled with dangerous misogynists.) By the late '80s, political pressure and audience fatigue forced filmmakers to come up with something new: supernatural killers like Chucky, a doll possessed by a trash-talking serial killer.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8746492/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,"Slashers got sophisticated in the '90s, evolving from Freddy Kreuger to Candyman to the terrifying Hannibal Lector. The 2000s brought ""torture porn"" - a response to post-9/11 panic.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Kurt Sayenga'],[''],[],[],[],"After Halloween, slasher films ruled the box office. But by 1984, audience fatigue and critical backlash had taken hold. Slashers appeared to be dead in the water...but the genre was only sleeping. Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) revolutionized the genre by fusing the slasher with the supernatural, in the shape of the dream-stalking Freddy Krueger. Unlike Jason and Michael Myers, this was a talkative monster with a big personality. Craven made the killer a superstar like never before. Another iconic screen monster, Candyman (1992) was the first major studio horror film to deal with the lasting effects of racial violence in America. Tony Todd's Candyman was the victim of a lynching who returns as a formidable, but strangely romantic, supernatural murderer.

The traditional, non-supernatural masked slasher made a comeback with a postmodern twist in Scream (1996). Writer Kevin Williamson knew that audiences weren't afraid of slasher movies anymore because they knew all of the clichés. He shocked viewers out of their seats by creating characters that also knew all of the clichés, including the serial killers who attempt to bring down the film's strong female protagonist. Director Wes Craven, by this point at the peak of his powers, played the film right at the edge where horror gives way to comedy.

A far more serious reinvention of the slasher, The Silence of the Lambs (1991) made grisly horror respectable with its A-List cast and crew, including director Jonathan Demme and Oscar-winning composer Howard Shore. Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins, became one of the most iconic villains of all time, introducing the figure of the hyper-intelligent serial killer into popular culture. Yet the film succeeds because the monster is not the star; the film is told from the perspective of the deeply empathetic FBI agent Clarice Starling, in an Oscar-winning performance by Jodie Foster.

The 21st century began with the 9/11 terror attacks, ramping up national anxiety and fear to almost unbearable levels. That fear was reflected in movies like James Wan's Saw (2004) and Eli Roth's Hostel (2005), which dared us not to turn away from graphic images of torture and bloodletting. Those movies were labeled ""torture porn,"" but it was no coincidence that at the same time the U.S. was under world indictment for actually torturing people. By showing what we imagined was occurring behind closed doors, these films were projections of our mixed feelings about the War on Terror.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8746500/?ref_=ttep_ep4,,"The fear that demons will enter our bodies and make us do terrible things has inspired some of the most frightening films ever made, including the masterpieces Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Kurt Sayenga'],[''],[],"['reference to get out', 'reference to the exorcist']",[],"Science tells us evil comes from within. It's often the product of childhood abuse or faulty brain chemistry. But many religions tell a different story: that there is a devil in hell who wants to destroy us. A devil whose demons enter our bodies and make us do terrible things.

The Exorcist (1973), widely considered the scariest film ever shot, made demonic possession a cultural phenomenon. A society that had begun to doubt the validity of religion became obsessed with the idea of being pawns in a battle between God and the Devil. But the film may have also resonated because the transformation of a young girl into a monster reflected the anxiety many parents felt in the wake of the '60s, when America's young people moved away from the conservative norms of society.

The Exorcist was a big-budget production from a Hollywood studio, but possession films don't always need amazing special effects, as Oren Peli proved with his terrifying micro-budget sensation Paranormal Activity (2007). By shooting his possession film in the ""found footage"" style with unknown actors, Peli made jaded audiences believe in the possibility of demons again.

Peli approached his material with utter seriousness, but many filmmakers infuse their possession films with black comedy and a heaping helping of social commentary. With Jennifer's Body (2009), feminist filmmakers Karyn Kusama and Diablo Cody told a story about a ""popular"" teenage girl who becomes a man-eating succubus - an acid commentary on sex, friendship, and the anger that lies beneath a woman's perfect surface. The crazed intensity of Jennifer's Body owes a big debt to Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981). That film, about a group of clueless college kids who become possessed by violent, set the bar for over-the-top. By Evil Dead II (1987), Raimi had become a virtuoso director, inventing a dynamic shooting style that influenced a generation of filmmakers, including the young Quentin Tarantino.

If it was possible to laugh at the teens in The Evil Dead, one could feel nothing but dread for Rosemary in Rosemary's Baby (1968), who finds her marriage, her home, and her womb overtaken by Satan himself. Though the movie is about a supernatural assault, it's also a potent allegory for domestic abuse. The Omen (1976) picks up where Rosemary's Baby left off, showing the Antichrist as a boy adopted by a politician and his wife. Audiences were shocked to see Hollywood legends Gregory Peck and Lee Remick in a movie that included a priest being impaled and a very graphic decapitation. The Omen blatantly capitalized on parental fears that their ""troubled child"" might actually be Evil Incarnate.

At their core, possession movies are about the fear of a demon taking control of your body and your mind. In 2017, Jordan Peele's Get Out (2017) took that idea and used it to hold a mirror up to American racism. In Get Out, the demons are not from hell, they're rich white people who want to take over black bodies and minds.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8746504/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,"Monsters hold a special place in the history of horror. The killer predators in nature. The nightmare creatures of the fantastic. And the monsters inside us, waiting to escape.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Kurt Sayenga'],[''],[],[],[],"Monsters hold a special place in the history of horror: the killer predators in nature, the nightmare creatures of the fantastic, and the monsters inside us waiting to escape. They can be frightening, or fun, or both. Whatever their size or shape, whether they're humanoid or utterly alien, monsters are reflections of ourselves.

Pennywise from It (2017) is a nightmare hiding behind the mask of a clown. Director Andy Muschietti's dynamic adaptation of Stephen King's novel turned this classic tale of adolescents grappling with evil into the highest-grossing horror film of all time. It had a great monster, but at its heart it a story about the horrors of the adult world: racism, misogyny, bullying, and child abuse.

It gave us a shape-shifting monster born from our deepest fears. So did the hideous shape-shifting creatures in John Carpenter's The Thing (1982), a true landmark of horror cinema and a monster-lover's dream movie. The decadent, anarchic hellraisers in Joe Dante's Gremlins (1984) tap into a different part of our brains...the part that wants to act on our wildest impulses. Dante's wild visual imagination flared to all-time heights in Gremlins 2, the lesser-seen but nominally superior sequel.

Some of the most terrifying films ever made show us what happens when the animal kingdom rises up against us. Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963) dramatized an avian uprising while putting icy blonde Tippi Hedren through a psychic ringer. Lewis Teague's adaptation of Stephen King novel Cujo (1983) turned a faithful family dog into a rabid monster bent on murdering a woman and her child - a handy metaphor for every parent's fear of being unable to protect their children from the horrors of the world. Of course, the ultimate man vs. nature story is Stephen Spielberg's Jaws (1975), the movie that gave the words ""a day at the beach"" a lot more bite. The first summer blockbuster and one of the greatest American films ever made, Jaws is an exercise in horror filmmaking that has yet to be surpassed.

Humans fear the ferocity of nature, but deep down we know that the biggest threat we face is the beast lurking inside of us. The Wolf Man (1941) invented the ""ancient"" werewolf tropes that most people know today: that a person pure of heart can become a wolf at the full moon, and can only be killed by a silver bullet. In 1981, two great directors, John Landis and Joe Dante, released very different takes on the werewolf: Landis's An American Werewolf in London (1981) and Dante's The Howling (1981). These movies ushered in the great age of creature transformation effects and doubled as black-humored social commentary.

Guillermo Del Toro's fantasy-horror films The Shape of Water (2017) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006) ask, ""What makes a monster?"" Is it the ugliness on the outside, or the ugliness on the inside? Both films feature people who have positive relationships with monsters, but live in fear of handsome, successful, but deeply evil men."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8746510/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,"Modern vampires come in many guises, but they all address our fascination with sex and death. From the ghastly Count Orlok to the glam vampires of True Blood, thirsty fiends are endlessly appealing.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Kurt Sayenga'],[''],[],[],[],"Vampires have an appeal like no other monster. They embody our darkest desires: the violent urges and forbidden lusts we secretly wish we could indulge. They also reflect our conflicting attitudes about two of the great concerns of life: sex and death.

The most famous vampire of all time is, of course, Count Dracula. Created at the end of the 19th Century, Bram Stoker's famous creation has proved to be a flexible metaphor. In the 1922 German silent film Nosferatu (1922), the vampire stood in for the First World War. In 1931, audiences flocked to see Bela Lugosi play the Count, who now represented the draining forces of the Great Depression. Christopher Lee's Dracula embodied mid-century fears of sexuality (particularly female sexuality), while Gary Oldman's Dracula was part lover, part monster, and all Goth.

Dracula's attitudes toward sex were rooted in the late 19th Century. A century later, Anne Rice gave us a new breed of bloodsuckers: Vampires as tortured heroes and amoral villains, freed from society's constraints. With Interview with the Vampire, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt gave Rice's story the kind of star power that no vampire movie had ever seen, all the more surprising given the characters' implied bisexuality. Vampirism has served as a metaphor for alternative sexuality from Dracula's Daughter (1936) through the lesbian vampire cycle of the 1970s to HBO's recent television series True Blood (2008). Based on the Southern Vampire Mysteries by John Millinder, True Blood took viewers into a sex-charged world where vampires emerged from the shadows into mainstream society.

The classic The Lost Boys (1987) reimagined vampires as troubled teens living a Peter Pan lifestyle filled with big hair and shirtless saxophone players. The 1996 Western-Horror hybrid From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)'s vampires are seductive strippers and rowdy bikers who are actually bat creatures that gush green blood. Let the Right One In (2008) forsakes standard clichés in its story about a lonely boy who befriends a vampire girl. The film's vampires are scary, but sympathetic.

Vampires are usually portrayed as creatures with dual natures - they're passionate lovers and merciless killers. But in the 2000s, perhaps mirroring the polarization of society, we've seen them split into two radically different types: The vampire as vicious predator, in films like 30 Days of Night (2007) and the vampire as dreamboat boyfriend, in the most commercially successful vampire film of all time, Twilight (2008). Although Twilight is often scorned by horror fans and criticized for its conservative sexual politics, it was the rare vampire film to give its female protagonist total agency and a strong point of view.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9130454/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,"Ghost movies have been with us since the dawn of cinema. Some ghosts are benevolent, some ghosts are malicious, but they all represent the mystery of what happens to us after we die.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Kurt Sayenga'],[''],[],[],[],"Chances are you or someone you know believes they have encountered a ghost. Ghosts make us question if there's something else beyond this life...and whether the afterlife might not be the paradise we hope for.

Films like Robert Wise's brilliant The Haunting (1963) conjure up chills without ever showing the spirits. That all changed when producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper made the special effects extravaganza Poltergeist (1982). Bringing ghosts out of spooky old houses and into a modern California suburb, Poltergeist is a rollercoaster ride that both entertains and comments on capitalist greed, our addiction to television, and the role of the nuclear family in the '80s. The spirit of Poltergeist lives on in Insidious (2010), in which a boy is haunted by ghosts from ""The Further,"" an afterlife dimension filled with tortured souls. Lin Shaye's performance as a paranormal investigator turned her into a most unusual horror icon: an ass-kicking, ghost-busting 70-something-year-old woman.

Poltergeist and Insidious show us normal families bonded by a love strong enough to survive supernatural attacks. In Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel The Shining (1980), evil ghosts push an already dysfunctional family over the edge. King objected to the many liberties Kubrick took with his novel, but the film's champions argue that it's filled with stunning visuals, and it does a great job of turning a family's trauma cycle into supernatural terror. Like The Shining, The Sixth Sense (1999) features a boy who can see the spirits of the dead. Ten-year-old Haley Joel Osment's haunting performance went a long way to selling the film's underlying premise: that people's inability to communicate with each other is scarier than the supernatural.

The theme of ghosts looking to the living to solve unfinished business began long before The Sixth Sense. The Changeling (1980) is about a grief-stricken composer, played by George C. Scott, who moves into a house haunted by a murdered boy. It is perhaps the greatest example of the ghost mystery movie, in which the initially terrifying ghost is revealed to be the victim of a terrible crime and is looking for justice. It's a device that Guillermo Del Toro uses to great effect in his ghost movies The Devil's Backbone (2001) and Crimson Peak (2015).

Ghost stories are fundamentally about the ways in which the past casts a long shadow on the present. In The Ring, the sins of the past come back in the memorably monstrous form of the vengeful ghost Samara. The Ring (2002) was based on the Japanese sensation Ringu (1998). Although the plots are the same, the two films show that Eastern and Western cultures can have very different ideas of what is ""scary.""
