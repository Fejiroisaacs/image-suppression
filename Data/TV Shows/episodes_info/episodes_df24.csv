But there's more to being a hero than just choosing a name and costume.",[],TV-MA,Release date,"['Robert Valley', 'Jeff Allen']","['', '', '']",[],"['superhero', 'gay', 'gay best friend', 'gay student', 'gay friend', 'homosexual', 'gay guy', 'neck snap', 'head twisted backwards']",[],"Two guards are outside the White House, upcoming Superhuman Evasion Training, and how one of them will be gone that week. One of them, Steve, discusses how his son was a problem but has turned his life around and how he's taking his son to London on vacation to show how he and his wife appreciate their son's hard work

The villainous Mauler Twins break up through the pavement and bicker about which one of them is the clone of the original. As the White House's weaponry opens up on them, one of the Twins points out that since the President is targeting them, the plan was to kill him publicly. They open fire and destroy the weaponry, and Steve shoots at them and orders them to surrender. He hits one Twin in the eye, hurting him, and the Twin prepares to kill him.

The Guardians of the Globe drop out of the sky and Immortal fights one while Red Rush gets the guards to safety. War Woman has the soldiers evacuated, and the wounded Twin attacks her. Darkwing evacuates civilians, and Green Ghost uses her powers to render some civilians intangible so they're not hurt by debris.

Martian Man and Aquarus fight a Twin breaking through the White House wall, then the heroes go inside to clear the building. The Twin throws a civilian into the sky, and Darkwing snags her and drops to the nearby sidewalk. When the Twin throws a tank at a nearby building, Darkwing and the woman are caught in the collapse. The hero gets the woman clear using his grappling line, but is still trapped. Omni-Man arrives and lifts the tank off of Darkwing, who destroys falling debris landing on Darkwing and flies off on his hover platform.

Immortal tosses more soldiers clear, and Omni-Man flies overhead and grabs them. Once the White House is clear, the Guardians and Omni-Man unite and fight the Twins with no civilians to be harmed. The heroes take out the two villains.

At home, Mark Grayson is in the bathroom on the toilet reading a comic book. His mother Debbie comes in, looking for soap. Later downstairs, Mark watches a newscast about the White House, and tells Debbie that his father Nolan--Omni Man--is there with the Guardians fighting the Mauler Twins. Debbie isn't impressed, and Omni-Man flies down and comes in. He goes to show, and Debbie insists on kissing him first. Mark is disgusted that his parents are talking about sex in front of him.

As Mark prepares to go to school, he overhears his parents talking about going to Berlin for brats. When he complains, Omni-Man says that Mark has school and he can go when his powers kick in. Mark points out that his powers haven't kicked in yet, and Omni-Man assures him that on his home planet Viltrum, powers kick in by the 18th birthday.

As Mark leaves, he sees Omni-Man fly off overhead. He tries to fly but fails, as a passing postman stares.

At school, Mark and his friend William Clockwell talk about the Twins' attack. Mark defends Omni-Man, who is considered ""the underdog"". A bully down the hall, Todd, is harassing another student, Amber Bennett. Mark insists on getting involved, and tells Todd to back off. Todd beats him, and Amber kicks Todd in the groin. The bully runs off, and Amber thanks Mark for trying to help her.

That night at Mark's job at BurgerMart, he's hauling out garbage. He tosses one bag in, but it flies off into the sky from his over-powered throw. Mark realizes that his powers have manifested.

Later, Mark goes home for dinner and Nolan arrives. Mark tells them that he's getting his powers, and Debbie kicks Nolan under the table until he expresses some enthusiasm. Nolan tells Mark that he'll start training him in the morning.

That night, Mark tries to sleep but can't. He remembers when he was young, and Nolan told him that he really comes from Viltrum, an alien planet. Viltrumites possess super-strength and speed. When they come of age, they venture out into the galaxy to help less-advanced races. Nolan relocated to Earth to be its soul protector, met Debbie, and they eventually married and had Mark, who is half-Viltrumite.

In the past, Nolan explains the changes Mark will go through when he hits puberty, including getting powers.

In the present, Mark remembers Nolan telling him that he's going to be able to fly. He gets out the window onto the roof, braces himself, and jumps off. Mark hovers in mid-air,, then flies off into the sky. An airliner almost hits him and Mark flies out of Earth's atmosphere, passes out from lack of oxygen, and falls back to earth. He wakes up just as he crashed into the street in front of his house.

The next morning, an exhausted Mark wakes up at 6 am. Omni-Man comes in and gets Mark, and they fly up into the sky. Mark's father explains about Mark has to focus on flying since he's a novice, and leads him away. Omni-Man notes that Mark is better at flying than he should be, and wonders if he's been doing late-night practice. He has Mark land, but Mark can't slow down and crashes into the earth. Omni-Man then trains Mark in how to fight, and continues giving his son tips. He punches Mark in the chest, knocking him to the ground, and apologizes for hitting him harder than he intended. Omni-Man tells Mark that if he wants to be a superhero, he needs to be prepared for anything.

Mark and Nolan return home, and Mark goes up to his room. Nolan tells Debbie that he pushed Mark far and it's what Mark needs, and snaps at Debbie when she questions him. Debbie asks Nolan what's gotten into him, and Nolan apologizes and says that Mark getting his powers so late changes things. He wonders if their lives would have been better if Mark hadn't gotten powers at all.

The next day at school, William notes that Mark isn't very talkative. Todd comes up, grabs Mark, and slams him into a locker. Mark invites Todd to hit him, and when Todd does so, Mark shrugs him off and tells Todd to hit him again and again. Todd does so and Mark doesn't flinch, and Toss calls him a freak and walks off. Mark tells William that he needs something to punch.

Later, Mark makes an improvised mask and flies through the nearby city, and hears gunfire. Titan, a stone-skinned villain, and two robbers are running from the guards. As Titan grabs his two associates and jumps over a gate, Mark flies up and slams Titan back. Mark hasn't come up with a superhero a name yet, and Titan beats him. Mark finally slams Titan down the alleyway and knocks Titan out, so Titan drops his armored skin.

Omni-Man flies up and tells Mark that he looks ridiculous, and suggests they get out of there. They fly to a rooftop and Omni-Man points out that Mark did a lot of damage, and he's not ready to be a superhero. Mark tells his father to hit him now that he's ready for it, and when Omni-Man refuses, Mark tells him to let him prove he can take the pain and is ready to be a superhero. The teenager tells Omni-Man that he wants to do what he does, and Omni-Man hugs him and assures him that he will be.

The superhero flies off, telling Mark to follow him. Omni-Man flies his son to the basement of a tailor shop at a mall, where Art Rosebaum is working. Art tells Mark that he secretly makes supersuits, and Mark says that he wants something ""iconic"". The tailor asks what name Mark has decided on, and tells Mark to think about it and get back to him.

That night at home, Debbie goes outside and finds Mark crashing into the earth. He explains that he was practicing his landings, and Debbie tells him that he needs to sleep. Debbie orders Mark inside and he tells her to make him. His mother asks if his being strong is important, and Mark says that it's important. Debbie tells Mark that she's there for him if he needs to talk, and figures that she's boring and Nolan isn't. Mark worries that he's nothing special, more like Debbie than Nolan, and wonders how he can live up to Omni-Man. Debbie tells her son that he just needs to be the greatest him, not the greatest Omni-Man, and assures him that the greatest Mark is enough.

The next day, Mark and Nolan float in the sky and play catch. Nolan wonders why Mark seems distracted, and Mark finally tells his father that he's scared that he can't handle superheroing. His father throws a ball around the globe, and Mark catches it. Nolan explains that along the path of being a superhero, Mark might have to do things he doesn't want to do or think he can't do, and it's okay to be scared. Nolan tells his son that he has to push through his doubts, and if he can then he'll be fine.

Mark says that he can do that, and tosses the ball around the planet to his father. Nolan tells Mark that he is invincible. Getting an idea, Mark goes to Art and tells him his new superhero name.

Soon, the costumed Invincible is sitting on a crane above the city.

Cecil Stedman, director of the GDA, and his aide Donald Ferguson. When they see the carnage, Cecil pounds on a console and curses in frustration.

Debbie wakes up in her bed, alone, gets up, and goes to get breakfast. As she eats and prepares for her day, Mark comes downstairs and asks what's wrong. Debbie says that she's just missing Nolan, who didn't come home the previous night. As Debbie leaves, she finds two GDA agents at her doorstep. They take her and Mark to the GDA base at the Pentagon, and Donald assures them that Omni-Man is getting the best care. He explains that the GDA works secretly with superheroes to keep the world safe.

Donald takes Mark and Debbie to Omni-Man's room, where the hero is unconscious. He says that they're doctors are doing their best, and Cecil steps out of the shadows and says that they'll find out who did it and will make sure they suffer. Cecil introduces himself and says that someone murdered the Guardians, and figured that Omni-Man was lured there and tried to kill him with Guardians. He wanted Debbie to know before the public found out, and Debbie insists on staying there and taking care of Nolan.

Getting a report on his comm, Donald tells Cecil that there's a large attack occurring downtown. Mark briefly takes his father's hand and then flies downtown as Invincible. Alien Flaxans are invading through a teleportation portal, and killing civilians and police alike. The police weapons are useless, and a blast sends Invincible flying as he intervenes.

Invincible knocks the Flaxan leader away from an injured civilian woman and flies her away. The Flaxans open fire, further injuring the woman and knocking Invincible into a blast crater. Meanwhile, the injured Flaxan leader commandeers an attack vehicle and opens fire on Invincible. Atom Eve flies down and shields Invincible, and the other members of Teen Team--Dupli-Kate, Rex Splode, and Robot--join her. The teen heroes battle the Flaxan soldiers, and Atom Eve tells Invincible to get the woman to a hospital.

Invincible recognizes Atom Eve and flies off with the unconscious woman. Robot warns that they may be outnumbered, and the Leader brings up his attack vehicle and prepares to fire.

The Flaxans start aging and collapse, and the survivors retreat through the portal. The Leader glances back briefly and then leaves last, and the portal closes.

Invincible flies to the GDA and asks for a doctor help the woman. Soldiers uncloak and train their guns on the hero, and doctors arrive and take the woman to an operating room. Later, Debbie finds Mark at Nolan's bedside. He's covered in blood and tells his mother that he tried his best trying to be like his father. Debbie hugs her son and says that it's okay.

The next day at school, a distracted Mark walks through the hallways, bumping into student without noticing. Will finally gets his friend's attention, and Mark tells Will that his father got attacked. His friend says that he's there for Mark, and Mark notices popular girl Eve Wilkins and tells Will that he needs to talk to her. Mark goes over and introduces himself, and thanks her for saving him at Atom Eve. She realizes that Mark is Invincible, and asks if Mark wants to talk about the invasion.

As Mark and Eve walk off, two girls talk about how Todd freaked out after Mark let him hit him. Amber overhears them and the girls say that Amber is the reason Todd beat Mark up.

Eve and Mark sit out by the school stadium and talk about their superhero lives. She says that Invincible didn't do bad for a rookie, and that people escaped because of Mark. Eve assures Mark that he'll get used to the fighting, and that it's not how it looks like on TV. She invites him to come and meet Teen Team after school, and Mark jokingly agrees.

Cecil meets with Robot and tells him that the Teen Team did good. Robot identifies the Flaxans and figures that the aliens come from a place where time runs faster. Cecil asks how Invincible did, and Robot tells the director Just missing your dad. He didn't come home last night that he has promise. The director figures that Invincible better toughen up, and uses his teleportation belt to go to the Guardians' base.

Donald tells Cecil that whoever attacked the team cut the security cameras. Cecil orders the techs outa, and detective demon Damien Darkblood reveals himself, examining the bloodstains. Damien gets psychic impressions of the Guardians dying but not who attacked them, and Cecil agrees to let him help find the killer.

At school, Amber approaches Mark at his locker and says she heard Mark took a few punches from Todd for her. Mark dismisses it and meets with Eve. The two of them walk off as Amber watches.

Once they're away from the school, Atom Eve leads Invincible through the city. Invincible loses control, crashes, and hangs onto the edge of a rooftop. Invincible pulls himself up and follows Atom Eve again, and she takes him to the Team's secret base. Atom Eve and Rex kiss, and Rex sarcastically thanks Invincible for his ""help"" at the invasion.

Robot tells the other heroes what he's learned about the Flaxans' temporal rate, and he's created a detector to tell them when the aliens return. The robot asks Invincible if they can count on him in the future, and Invincible immediately agrees.

Later at the hospital, Mark tells the unconscious Nolan that the Teen Team was cool, except Rex. When Mark mentions Eve, Debbie comes in and Mark says that Eve is just a friend. She asks how Mark is doing, and Mark says that fighting aliens wasn't what he thought. Debbie says that they can talk.

Mark goes to check on the woman he rescued, Maya, and the doctor tells Mark that it's too soon to tell if she'll be okay.

At the Teen Team base, Rex notices the early-warning system beeping.

At school, Mark tells Will that he and Eve are just friends. Will says that Mark has a chance of dating Eve, and tells Mark that he should take Rex's place. Mark sees Eve and excuses himself, and Amber sits with Will and asks if Mark is dating anyone. Will tells her that Mark isn't, and that Eve has a boyfriend. He offers Amber Mark's phone number.

Invincible and Atom Eve fly to the TT base, and Rex is jealous when he sees them together. The Flaxans are below on the street, coming through a portal. The Leader tells his men to open fire and they do on the civilians. Robot realizes that the Flaxans have discovered a way to resist Earth's timestream,.

As Invincible and Atom Eve fly down, the Flaxans open fire on them. When Rex and Dupli-Kate attack them, the soldiers kill several of Dupli-Kate's clones and repel Rex's explosive spheres. When Robot flies down on the team hovercycle, the Flaxans fire an EMP device that shorts out Robot. Atom Eve shields the civilians and attacks the Flaxans. They fire drones at her that overwhelm her and concentrate their fire on Invincible, then trap him with adhesive guns.

The Leader prepares to kill Eve, and an enraged Invincible breaks free and knocks the Leader down, then beats him. He flies to Atom Eve and pulls off the drone that has attached herself to her face, and the Leader's protective wristband shorts out and he starts to age. Robot senses it happening and tells the others to destroy the soldiers' wristbands.

The heroes do so, and Robot analyzes a wristband and determines the counter frequency. He projects it, cancelling out the other wristbands, and the Flaxans start aging rapidly. They retreat through their portal and it disappears, and even Rex admits that Invincible was impressive. Invincible gets a call and tells the others that he has to go,

At the GDA base, Mark arrives at Nolan's room and discovers that his father is awake. He hugs Nolan, and Debbie says that her husband is okay enough to come home. Nolan has Mark tell him everything that has happened.

As the family leaves, Mark learns that Maya died. Nolan casually tells him that it's part of the job, and tells the nurse to get him his costume back.

People start to notice that the Guardians are gone.

Nolan and Mark continue sparring, and Cecil arrives to tell them that Allen the Alien is approaching Earth. Despite Cecil's reluctance to ask him, Nolan says that he'll stop him. When Debbie protests, Mark says that he'll go. Nolan agrees, figuring Mark can take Allen, and assures his son that he doesn't need to breathe in space.

Invincible flies into space, and Allen attacks him, mistaking him for Omni-Man. The hero tells Allen to stay away from his planet and fights back, and Invincible slams his opponent into the Moon.

The hero finally says that he just wants to talk, and Allen grants him a ""time out"". The alien sets up improvised chairs and explains that he's an evaluation officer for the Coalition of Planets. He comes by less-developed planets from time to time to make sure there's someone capable of defending them against monsters. Allen explains that ""Urath"" signed up for the plan, and Invincible explains that it's Earth, not Urath. The alien figures that he's in trouble, shakes hands with Invincible, and leaves.

Before Cecil goes, he has Nolan go over one more time what happened. Nolan claims that he got a distress call from the Guardians, and when he got to the base the lights went out and someone attacked him, and then he passed out. Debbie asks Cecil if he has any leads, and as he leaves Cecil says that people always think they're smarter than the GDA... at first.

The Flaxans launch another attack.

At school, Todd grabs Mark and whispers that he's sorry he beat him. He tells Mark that Amber wants to give Mark her phone number, and whispers an explanation that Amber found some old photos of him and promises to delete them if Todd delivered her message. Eve calls Mark to tell him about the invasion.

The Flaxans attack from multiple portals, and the power-suited Leader crushes civilians beneath his feet. As the TT arrives, Robot analyzes the Flaxan weapons and tells the others that there are too many Flaxans, they've improved their weaponry, and have rendered themselves immune to Earth's timestream. He wants to tell Cecil to consider a nuclear response, and Invincible objects. Atom Eve agrees and the heroes leap into action.

The Leader grabs Invincible and throws him away, and jumps on him and continues beating him. The Flaxans overwhelm the rest of the team, and Omni-Man arrives, grabs the Leader, pulls him off Invincible, and lifts him into the air.

The Flaxan weaponry is useless against Omni-Man, and he smashes through them. They retreat through their portals, against the Leader's orders, and Omni-Man grabs the Leader and flies through the last portal. Invincible yells ""Dad!"" and the other heroes realize that Invincible is Omni-Man's son.

Later, Mark returns home and tells Debbie that Omni-Man saved them from the Flaxans but went into one of their portals. She dismisses Omni-Man fighting aliens in another dimension as just another Tuesday, and figures that he's explaining nicely why they should leave Earth alone.

On the Flaxan home world, Omni-Man tells the aliens that Earth isn't theirs to conquer. He then kills the Leader, smashes through the buildings, killing thousands, and destroys the civilization. Returning home, Omni-Man tells his family that he needs a shower. The news reports that the Guardians are dead.

At the GDA, Damien meets with Cecil and Donald, and tells them that only the Guardians and Omni-Man were at the scene of the murders. Which means that the killer was one of them. Cecil tells Damien not to tell anyone his theories. Disgusted, Damien leaves and Cecil tells Donald to put a surveillance team on the Graysons if the killer decides to finish the job."

Despite that, Nolan tells Mark that he has to keep his hero life separate from his home life, and Mark goes to his room.

Once they're alone, Debbie complains to Nolan about his frivolous attitude. Nolan tells her that it's ""the life"", and Mark has to learn to separate his heroic career from his personal life.

Rex says that the clones aren't the real Kate, and they get offended since it's not true and leave.

Later at the Pentagon, Invincible attends Robot's tryouts for the new Guardians, but says that he isn't trying out because Omni-Man wants to train Mark himself. Robot says that Invincible underestimates himself, and Invincible says that he'll still be around helping.

Robot thanks everyone for coming, and Burly auditions by fighting Atom Eve. Eve angrily defeats him, and Shrinking Rae defeats her opponent, by getting inside his inner ear and disrupting it. Black Samson defeats her opponent and then helps her up, displaying the strength of his character and spirit.

When the tryouts are over, Robot introduces the new Guardians, including Samson, Rae, and Monster Girl. Monster Girl is a 14-year old girl, but when Rex teases her she transforms into a green-skinned monster and beats him senseless. Invincible intervenes, but Rex doesn't thank him it.

Robot finishes by introducing Atom Eve as their final member, and thanks the other heroes for coming. Eve tells Robot that she can't be on the same team as Rex and Kate and walks off, and Invincible wonders why. Rex leaves without explaining.

Rex points out that Black Samson lost his powers and got kicked off the team. Black Samson tells Rex that he'll assume it's a joke, so he won't beat him, and then tells Robot that they need a human leader.

Black Samson points out that he should be in charge because he's the most experienced, and when Rex objects Rae says that she thought the team counted on teamwork. She tells them to call her when they figure it out and leaves, and everyone else walks out on Robot except Monster Girl. Monster Girl tells Robot that she can't do three combat exercises because when she transforms, the curse makes her younger. She's actually 24 years old, and three exercises are too much for her. Robot sympathizes with her for to be heard for the world to judge them by experiences.

Cecil teleports out and Amber comes in, and Mark makes an excuse about helping Nolan's friend. Debbie comes in with snacks.

Invincible and Atom Eve head to Rushmore, and the GDA monitors them because Nolan is dealing with a Kaiju in Japan. Cecil explains that Doc has a pair of shockwave-generating gloves, and they give him a concussion and brain damage every time he uses them.

Doc is causing earthquakes, and crevasses that spew lava. He tells the tourists to bow to him, Invincible saves a group of Boy Scouts from the falling head of Lincoln, puts it back, and Doc blasts him. Atom Eve shields Invincible with an energy shield, and Doc flies away riding a shockwave and Atom Eve chases him. He stops, and Invincible throws a boulder at him. Doc shatters it with his wrist bracelets, then blasts the area.

More crevasses open up, revealing lava, and a family of three tourists start to fall in. Atom Eve stops them but then falls into another crevasse.

Omni-Man is there and Invincible tells him that he left Amber in his room, and his father tells him that the tricky part is balancing his hero and his personal lives. Omni-Man reminds Invincible that he's a Viltrumite and they have responsibilities that normal humans don't. He advises Invincible to change out of his costume, and Mark goes into his room and apologizes to Amber for having to duck out.

Amber wonders why Mark agreed to hang out if he wasn't going to hang out, and Mark insists that he does want to. He wonders why Amber came when she didn't even know he existed until he stood up to Todd, and they both agree that Todd kicked Mark's ass. She says that Mark is the first guy who stood there and took punches for her, and wanted to know the kind of guy that would do that. Amber sits on the bed next to Mark and asks what they do now.

From the beach where Omni-Man defeated the kaiju, William calls Cecil and tells him that it's the first time he's seen Omni-Man on the ropes... and the kaiju might not be dead. Cecil tells William to save the kaiju's body.

Nolan offers Debbie a bit of the kaiju that stuck to his cape for dinner. He says that he'll call Cecil about putting GDA protection on the house, and she tells him that she sold a house earlier despite the fact there was a double homicide there.

At the Team Teen base, Atom Eve takes down her photos of her and Rex, then hears him on the roof setting off explosions as fireworks to get her attention, and flies up. Rex says that he doesn't want to screw up and she should know he doesn't mean to, and asks for a do-over. Atom Eve wishes him luck with the new team and flies off.

Atom Eve flies to Mark's house, peers in his bedroom window, and sees him and Amber making out on his bed. She turns away, smiles, says ""Good for you, Mark"", and leaves.

The original them kills his guard and uses his handprint to open his cell door, then frees his clone brother after he admits that he's a clone. When the GDA soldiers arrive, the clone pulls loose a piece of wall plating TO protect them as they advance.

When the Brothers get close enough, the original fights the soldiers hand-to-hand. They run, and the intruder closes a blast door behind them. A ladder drops down, providing the Brothers with an escape route. The Brothers climb out to the desert above, and an automated turret opens fire on them. The clone uses the original clone as a shield against the gunfire, runs close to the turret, and destroys it.

The clone, insisting he's the original, runs off and a drone monitors him. Cecil comes in and asks the intruder--Robot-if he has the new Guardians ready. Robot says that the team still has work to do but he's confident in the progress they've made.

Outside, the workers realizing who Bryant is resurrecting and back away in terror, and a sandstorm sweeps across the site. The green glowing Bryant appears in the tomb entrance, and the door slams down.

Omni-Man takes Invincible practice flying above the desert, and ends by having his son race to Mt. Everest. A climber reaches the point where they're standing. Once he climbs back down, Omni-Man admires the view. Invincible asks his father about Viltrumite, and Omni-Man says that the Viltrumites have ended wars all over the universe and brought peace. It's why Omni-Man is on Earth, and why Invincible is there.

When Invincible wonders why Omni-Man gave up his home planet to live on Earth, Omni-Man explains that when Invincible's grandparents died, he came to Earth to seek out something new. Debbie made Earth feel like a home to Omni-Man, and Invincible's birth changed things further. He tells Invincible that keeping the universe save and living up to their home world's heritage takes sacrifice. Invincible says that he gets that, and they race home.

Debbie visits Olga at her home, and she and Olga Debbie talk about the GDA is pursuing its own objectives and how it doesn't care about them. Olga figures that Cecil knows who killed the Guardians, but doesn't care. She says that she's moving back to Moscow and her family, and wants Debbie to help sell her house. Debbie agrees, and asks Olga if Josef ever lied to her. Olga admits that Josef did, and says that all heroes do. She only made the mistake of believing him once, when he said that everything was going to be fine.

Debbie drives home, pours herself some wine, and goes to work on her laptop selling Olga's house. She does a private search on Damien's background, and how he's the only one who has shed light on the truth. Omni-Man and Invincible come in, and Debbie clears her screen. Omni-Man tells her that their son has a hot date, and Mark insists that he and Amber are just hanging out. His parents gently mock Mark, and after Mark goes upstairs to shower, Omni-Arm suggests to his wife that they go out. Debbie says that Olga wants to sell her house and thinks there's a conspiracy around the murders, and Omni-Man dismisses it as Olga's drinking.

Amber takes Mark to a Filipino street fair and talks about her experiences in the Philippines, and asks Mark if he's done any travelling. Mark vaguely says that he's been to Mt. Everest, and then deflects Amber's questions about how he got there. He buys Amber something he can afford: a rice separator.

In his office, Damien drinks. Nolan comes in and accuses Damien of being in his house and frightening Debbie. Damien accuses him of murdering the Guardians, and Nolan suggests that Damien is the killer. Nolan tells Damien not to scare his family again, and figures people will believe him rather than a demon. As Nolan leaves, Damien tells him that he won't give up and the truth can't be hidden. The PI says that Debbie already suspects, and wonders when Mark will as well. Nolan curses and flies out.

The Mauler original takes supplies to an empty warehouse that he uses as a base, sets up his equipment, takes a DNA sample of himself using a drill, and makes a new clone of himself.

The new Guardians move into the old Guardians' base. Cecil teleports in to join them, and reminds them that they're heroes, not tourists. Rex points a splash of blood on the wall from the murdered Guardians, and Cecil says that he left it there as a reminder. When the heroes proves themselves worthy of being the Guardians, the stain will be cleaned off. Cecil gets a message via his comm, tells the heroes to settle in, and teleports back to the GDA.

Monster Girl asks Rex if they're cool, and points that out that he asked for the beating he gave her. He chuckles and admits that he did, and they both agree that the other heroes were assholes. Robot asks Rex not to let his personal and professional lives to intersect, and notes that Atom Eve leaving was the result of Rex's lapse in judgment. The mechanical man slaps Rex on the shoulder, and secretly takes a blood sample.

Nolan returns home and tells Debbie that he was ""reaching someone a lesson"". He suggests that they go to bed, and Debbie shrugs away from him. Nolan asks what's going on, and Debbie claims that she's distracted by work stuff. Nolan tells her that she's the wife of the most powerful man on Earth and shouldn't have to deal with work stuff, and Debbie angrily tells him she loves work stuff.

After shushing Debbie, Nolan grabs Cecil from the shadows where the man is hiding and slams him into the wall. He finally lets him go, saying that he didn't mean to teleport into the house, and Nolan admits that he's a little jumpy. Debbie asks why Cecil is there

Mark returns Amber to her home, and she tells him to plan their next date. They kiss and Amber goes inside, and he flies off and does flips in celebration. Mark returns home and finds his parents talking with Cecil. Cecil says that he needs Nolan to shadow the first manner mission to Mars, but Nolan won't do it. Nolan says that with the Guardians gone, he's needed on Earth. Cecil says that the planet needs a win after the Guardian massacre, and the mission is it.

Nolan says that his priority is to the family and Earth, and Mark volunteers. His father says that Mark's responsibilities are bigger than four astronauts, and Cecil didn't ask Mark to go. When Mark learns that it's a two-week mission, he hastily says that he's not ready and things with Amber are going well. Debbie tells Mark that it's up to Mark to make decisions about how he uses his powers. After a moment, Mark says that he'll do it.

Cecil teleports to the surveillance house across the street, and Donald points out that they wanted Nolan off-planet so they could investigate the Guardians' murders without raising his suspicions. Cecil figures the assignment will let them see what Mark can do, and if his heart is in the right place.

The next day at school, Mark tells Eve that he doesn't want to lie to Amber, but he can't tell her the truth. Eve says that dating regular people is a pain in the ass, and Mark points out that Eve dating Rex didn't work out. Eve says that she can't help Mark because she has her own crap to deal with, and Mark asks her to help him with his Amber stuff in return for him helping her with her Rex stuff. Eve says that she has more with that, and doesn't know what to do with her future. Mark tells her that he's there for her... after he gets back from Mars. Eve tells him that if Mark is going to tell Amber the truth, he'd better be serious about her. She asks Mark if he is serious about Amber.

Amber is at home watching a newscast about the mission launch, and Mark arrives at her doorstep with a baul that he bought for her at the street fair. He then tells Amber that he's volunteer and going away for two weeks, but doesn't give her details. Mark says that he volunteered last-minute, and asks her not to lose interest in him. She agrees to give Mark two weeks, and he leaves as the newscast shows the Mars ship taking off.

Invincible dons an air pack and flies after the spaceship, and takes a picture of Earth from space. Cecil talks to him via the comms and tells Invincible that he should stay out of sight unless something goes wrong, and Invincible is there to deal with the Martians. The GDA knows that the Martians live underground and keep to themselves, and they shouldn't have any trouble with them. Cecil tells Invincible that he should make sure the astronauts get home safe, and that humanity is counting on Invincible.

Debbie and Nolan are at home, watching the mission on TV. Nolan says that the mission is a waste of Mark's time, and Debbie tells her husband that it was Mark's decision and she's proud of him. Debbie tells her husband that he's been different since Mark got his powers, and Nolan insists that he's trying to teach their so. He defends himself, saying that he's been under a lot of stress, and Debbie points out that she's never met another Viltrumite. Debbie says that Nolan is hiding something from her, and it hurts.

Nolan says that he's terrified that he could lose everything, and Debbie admits that she does. He suggests that they go on a trip while Mark is gone, and kisses his wife.

Mark sits on the ship as it heads to Mars.

Nolan and Debbie go to Pisa, and Nolan says that he's made reservations at the café where they ate the last time they were there.

The shuttle lands on Mars, and Invincible flies ahead then hides so the four astronauts don't see him. They take samples, and a bored Invincible looks at photos of Amber and him on his camera. Invincible finally looks down and discovers that the astronauts are gone, and sees a drag trail leading away.

Sitting down, Debbie and Nolan have coffee and Nolan says that Debbie dumped him 20 years ago when they were last there. She says that she did it because Nolan was a dick, and he expected her to worship him because he flew her to Rome. Debbie tells her husband that he only got a second date because she saw him save some kids on the news, and says that she's glad they came. Nolan figures that she still thinks something is wrong, and Debbie says that she feels like she's standing on the edge of a cliff and doesn't know why.

Nolan tells Debbie that he hasn't been honest with her about the murders, and says that Cecil thinks he had something to do with them. He warns that Cecil doesn't like him and things could get bad, and says that they should deal with it by staying together as a family. Nolan tells Debbie that all she has to do is trust her, just as a dragon goes on a rampage across the city.

As everyone else runs, Nolan calmly asks Debbie if she trust him. She says that she does and tells Nolan to do something. Nolan says that he's on vacation and Cecil can earn his paycheck. Fighters attack the dragon,

Damien enters the Grayson home, searches the place, and finds Cecil waiting for him. GDA soldiers uncloak, aiming their guns at Damien, and Cecil tells the demon that Nolan warned them about Damien.

Invincible flies, following the drag trail, and finds that they end at a bare spot. Landing, Invincible examines the area and a sand storm sweeps over him. He finds a hatch and opens it, and small squid-like Sequids jump on him and pull him down. Invincible throws them off and goes down the hatch.

Beneath the hatch are tunnels, filled with more Sequids hanging to the walls. The Martians, similar to Martian Man, surround Invincible and aim their spears at him, and tell him not to move. Their leader asks Invincible if the astronauts are like him, and they take him to a throne room. The Martian ruler greets Invincible, and asks why he's there.

Invincible explains that he's there to protect the astronauts, who are standing nearby. The astronauts say that they have no idea who Invincible, and he sucks at his ""secret mission"". The ruler explains that the Sequids have spread across the galaxy, and when they bond with a host they become almost unstoppable. The Martians' shapeshifting abilities give them immunity, but if a Sequids merges with a human, they can rise up as one and savage Mars and then Earth.

Invincible explains that he's part-Viltrumite, and the ruler has heard of the Viltrumites. He tells that the humans are sentenced to immediate execution because they had contact with Sequids, and the Martians can't risk them being possessed.

Nodding, Invincible says that he understands... and then escapes with the astronauts. They run back to their shuttle, the mounted Martians following and shooting blasters at them. Invincible finally picks the astronauts up and flies them the rest of the way, and they prepare for emergency launch. Meanwhile, Invincible attacks the Martians but is soon outnumbered and blasted back to the shuttle. He lifts the shuttle up and the astronauts fly it the rest of the way into space. Invincible flies back, gets a rock as a souvenir, and reunited with the main craft out in space.

On the shuttle, we see that an unknown Martian shapeshifter is posing as an astronaut. Back on Mars, the original astronaut, now infected with a Sequid, unleashes a wave of Sequids on the Martian warriors.

The astronauts return to earth, and Invincible returns home and hears sounds of a fight inside. He finds Nolan and Debbie sitting on the couch, figures his parents were having sex, and goes to his room while Debbie chuckles.

The next day at school, Mark goes to Amber's locker. She kisses him in greeting and asks how his trip was, and Mark says that it was boring but he did help people. Mark shows Amber the rock he picked up, says it's an ""Earth rock"", and tells Amber not to show it to any geologist or anyone else. Amber thanks him for the regular ""Earth rock"" and kisses him again.

At the GDA HQ, Cecil and his soldiers escort Damien in. Cecil says that they found dried blood belonging to the Guardians, and Damien insists that it was planted by Nolan to frame him. Nolan tells Damien that he knows, leads Damien into an exorcism circle, and reveals that he has the necessary book recreated that Damien destroyed centuries ago.

Donald is there and casts the spell, and Cecil says that he needs to keep things grew until he can figure out why Nolan killed the Guardians. Cecil rings the bell completing the ritual, and Damien is sent back to Hell.

Debbie cleans up Olga's house then shows it to a couple. The couple says that they want it, and Debbie tells them that she'll start the paperwork.

Robot goes to a hidden clone chamber and inserts Rex's blood sample into the twisted clone inside. The creature says that finally phase 1 begins.

Back at home, Debbie tells Nolan that she sold Olga's house. Nolan tells her that Cecil called him and said that new evidence came up, and Nolan is in the clear. He assures Debbie that everything is fine... both unaware that Damien hid a satchel in Debbie's closet."

A man come down the alleyway and they draw their guns. He removes his jacket, transforms his skin into rock armor as he transforms into Titan, and charges at them. Titan smashes through the men, pasty the armored door, and into the center. The men inside open fire on Titan, whose armor protects him.

Titan picks up a nearby forklift and throws it the men, who scatter. One man grabs a heavy gun and opens fire, and Titan takes a discarded pistol and throws it into the man's head. One man is pinned beneath the thrown forklift, and watches as Titan takes out some of the others and the survivors run. Titan grabs the pinned man, frees him, and tells him to tell Mr. Lu that the next time he finds any of Lu's men on his turf, he won't be so gentle. The intruder then snaps the man's neck and tells the kid pointing a shotgun at him the message was for him. The kid shoots Titan in his face, temporarily destroying his armor on his face. It regenerates, and Titan tells the kid to go. Once the kid runs, Titan looks at his torn pants and swears.

The next day, Kill Cannon is on the streets shooting at Invincible. Invincible beats Kill Cannon unconscious and later at school, kids watch the battle on phone video. Mark arrives to see Amber, who walks away because he's late. Mark has brought her Japanese cheesecake in way of an apology, and she points out that it's crazy for him to be late to get cheesecake to apologize for being late.

Across town, Titan emerges from a burning building with a can of gasoline. He tosses it back in and it explodes. As Titan starts to walk away, one of the residents who got out asks him what they ever did to him. Titan walks back to the man, Kevin, and gives him and the other residents money to move into a hotel until they can find homes.

Invincible continues fighting villains as the people cheer him. He goes to hold up a building that was damaged in the fight, and is late to his job at the Burger Mart. Mark's boss, Mr. Sayre, tells Mark that he's been late 12 times in the past three months, and says that he's going to dock Mark's pay. Mark tells Sayre that he quits, flies off, and drops his apron on Sayre.

Titan holds a businessman up from the top of the tall building and threatens to drop him if he doesn't pay up. The thug, Gary, gives Titan his wall and Titan sees a photo of Gary and his daughter. Titan tosses Gary back onto the rooftop and gives him two days to pay.

Invincible and Omni-Man hold a super-villain above the city and threaten to drop him if he doesn't tell them where his gravity bomb is. Invincible hesitates to drop Isotope to scare him, and Omni-Man drops Isotope to show his son how it's done, and says that he'll catch the super-villain in a second.

Mark arrives late for class and runs through the hallways. Principal Winslow is waiting and tells Mark that if he plans to attend college then they need to have a conversation about Mark's recent attendance issues.

Titan breaks into a lab and takes a secure chip. Security guards arrive and aim their guns at Titan, and he advises them to shoot their guns in the air and they can all walk away happy and alive. The guards do so, and Titan walks out.

Invincible texts Amber that he can't make it for their date. She texts back that he's treading on dangerous ground standing her up, and he goes back to his fighting.

Titan goes to crime boss Machine Head and gives him the chip, and Machine Head inserts it into a slot on his head. He moans in ecstasy, and Titan says that it's the last and he's done. Machine Head tells him it isn't, and that Titan's problem is that he's too useful to be let go. As Machine Head's henchman Isotope looks on, Machine Head tells Titan that Titan needs the money and can't live a normal life, and he's a headbreaker. When Titan threatens him, Machine Head says that he knows where Titan's family lives so Titan works for him. Titan smashes Machine Head's desk in frustration, and Machine head tells him that he's never letting Titan go.

In space, Invincible tries to hold back an asteroid heading toward Earth. Omni-Man is calmly waiting, and when Invincible stops it, his father tells him to throw the asteroid back into space. Invincible does so, and Omni-Man tells him that it was a small one. The younger hero gets a text and tells Omni-Man that he has to go, and his father tells him that his training is more important. Omni-Man finally lets invincible go, and his son hugs him and flies off.

Mark arrives at Amber's house for dinner with her parents, apologizes for running late, and offers dessert. Amber walks off in frustration. They study in Amber's room, and she complains that Mark was two hours late as he eats leftovers. She asks Mark if she's important to him, and when he says that she is. Amber points out that when they make plans, Mark is late or doesn't show up and his excuses suck. Mark says that he has family responsibilities and it's hard making it fit, and Amber tells him to make the choice and she's not going down the road.

Mark tells Amber that he's going to do better, and Amber tells him to prove it. As Mark walks home, he kicks a rock in frustration and it goes through a house and into orbit. Nolan calls and tells him that a super-villain is robbing a store and he'd be good practice for Invincible. Mark tells his father that he's not in the mood, but reluctantly agrees.

Titan, in his unarmored form, goes into a fancy apartment in a rundown tenement, and gives the young girl sitting on the couch the ice cream that he brought. She greets him as ""Daddy"", and Titan's wife comes out and figures that they're not out. Titan tells his wife Vanessa that is isn't that simple, but Vanessa doesn't want to hear it and walks away.

Titan goes out on his fire escape and drinks, and his daughter Fiona comes out to sit with him. She points out Invincible overhead, flying his opponent Elephant to prison, and asks Titan if he's a good guy like Invincible. Titan doesn't have an answer for her.

Debbie goes to her closet, feels a chill, and finds the journal that Damien left hidden there. She looks at it and remembers what Damien said about being the only survivor of the Guardian massacre. Nolan comes in and Debbie hides the journal behind her back. Once Nolan leaves, Debbie locks herself in the bathroom and reads the journal. She finds a note saying ""Costume"" and remembers Nolan asking for his bloodstained costume back, at the hospital.

Eve tells her parents that she doesn't need to tell them when she breaks up with someone, and her father says that he only agreed to Eve being a superhero is because Rex was there to take care of her. His daughter says that she can take care of herself, and points out that Rex cheated on her. Her father tells eve to forgive Rex, saying that all guys make mistakes. Eve breaks into tears, and her father tells her that she can't be a superhero on her own and shouldn't be doing it at all.

Turning on her father, Eve tells him that for one thing she can do anything she wants and demonstrated her power. For another, Eve says that she's not sure that she wants to do it anymore. Her father says that it's about time, and Eve flies out and off.

The next day, Invincible is out flying in the clouds and salutes the passengers inside of a passing airliner. He notices his hero name written on a rooftop in the city, flies down, and finds Titan waiting for him. Titan tells Invincible that he got lucky when they fought a few months ago, but he's not there to fight now. He explains that he owes money and can't get out, and isn't a criminal. Titan wants Invincible to help him take down Machine Head.

Invincible has never heard of Machine Head, and Titan explains that Machine Head runs the city. When Invincible suggests that Titan call Fight Force, Titan tells him that he's just flying off and forgetting the ""little people'. Invincible picks up Titan, who shows invincible Machine Head's operations. They spot Machine Head and Isotope leaving a club, and Isotope teleports them away.

Titan tells Invincible that if he helps him takes down Machine Head, he'll help real people with real lives. They land near the community center that Vanessa and Fiona are leaving, and Titan says that he didn't borrow money for him. He goes over to his family, and Fiona hugs him.

That night at home, Mark tells Nolan that he can't take Machine Head by himself while Isotope is helping him. The Graysons are eating dinner, and Debbie is distracted by Damien's journal. Nolan tells Mark that he's making a huge mistake helping Titan, and that Titan is using Mark. Mark insists that he can tell that Titan isn't lying, and that he never wanted to be a criminal in the first place. Nolan says that the whole thing is beneath Mark, and Debbie only says that sometimes people aren't who they appear to be. Nolan agrees with her, and Debbie also says that helping someone is never beneath Mark. Mark says that he'll sleep on it as his mother picks at her food.

Later at the New Guardians' base, the team return after fighting the Lizard League. Rex has brought in beer for his teammates to drink in celebration, and Black Samson uses sonics to shatter the others' bottles and says that two dozen civilians are in the hospital because they didn't fight like a team. Robot replays a video of the fight, and Samson shows where Rex and Monster Girl let a bus of civilians crash.

Rex angrily says that they did their best and won, and dismisses Samson's opinion since he has no innate powers. Dupli-Kate intervenes and tells Rex that Samson isn't wrong, and Rex and the others leave Samson and Robot alone.

At home, Debbie is doing the dishes and asks Nolan why he told Mark that saving lives is beneath him. Nolan says that Mark needs to think big, and Debbie isn't helping because she's not a superhero and doesn't understand the choices they have to make. Debbie reminds her husband that she's one who taught Nolan how to be a hero, and now Nolan thinks she can't do the same for Mark. Nolan says that isn't what he meant, and he thinks that Mark is putting his trust in someone he shouldn't. He tells Debbie that he doesn't want Mark to make a choice he'll regret, and Debbie agrees. The couple hold each other, and Nolan says that he didn't think it would be so difficult.

The next day at school, Mark tells eve that his superhero career is destroying his GPA. Eve snaps at him, and Mark asks if she's okay. She says that she doesn't know what she's doing at Atom Eve. Amber comes up and asks Mark if he's coming that night, and Mark says that he is. Irritably, Amber tells him not stand her up and tells Eve that Mark agreed to volunteer with her at the community center downtown. Mark realizes that it's the same community center he saw Titan's family at. As he leaves, claimed he said he'd help Debbie with an open house, Amber tells Eve that she no excuse not to come help. She then asks Eve if Mark has been acting weird lately. Eve assures Amber that Mark is into Amber, and Eve says that she'll be at the center to volunteer.

That night, Titan takes Invincible overlooking Machine Head's penthouse and details the crime boss' security precautions. Titan explains that he ""took care"" of Isotope by paying the woman he sees to keep him there extra long.

Invincible asks Titan about Fiona, and Titan says that the community center is his family's second home. After considering, Invincible says that he's in but he has to make it clear because he has plans later.

Mauler is dozing at his secret warehouse base, wakes up, and activates his new clone by placing his own memories in it. The ""brothers"" immediately start arguing about which is the original and which is the clone. Robot steps out of the shadows and wonders why Mauler creates a clone who thinks he's the original, and easily avoids the brothers' attack when they come at him.

Robot jumps onto the replication chamber, and one brother stops the other from attacking Robot and damaging the chamber. Robot says that he needs their expertise in tissue growth, shows them the vial with the sample, and says that he'll make it worth the brothers' time.

The next day, Debbie calls Nolan from her car and asks him to pick up a few things for dinner. She has him fly over the globe, having calculated how long it will take Nolan. Once Nolan flies off, Debbie starts a timer on her phone, and goes through her house. With three minutes left, Debbie finds Nolan's bloodstained costume where he hid it. Nolan returns and Debbie kicks the costume under a counter.

Titan and Invincible smash through the penthouse's bombproof windows, then break into Machine Head's office. The crime boss isn't impressed, and says that he knew when Titan would betray him. Isotope teleports in and Machine Head says that the chip Titan got for him lets him calculate quantum probabilities. Isotope teleports in several villains that Machine Head has hired: Battle Beast, Kursk, Furnace, Magmaniac, and Tether Tyrant.

Eve meets Amber at the center kitchen, and Amber shows her around. Amber says that Mark isn't there, and she's giving him 15 minutes.

Invincible and Titan fight Machine Head's hired villains, but are outnumbered. Omni-Man watches from above as Invincible gets repeatedly beaten, and Invincible loses his temper, rips free of the holds on him, and fights back until one of the villains, Battle Beast, slams him to the floor.

At the center, Eve and Amber look at the time as Mark doesn't show up. Amber checks her phone, and discovers that Mark hasn't reached out to her.

Battle Beast continues to beat Invincible, and the Guardians arrive in response to an anonymous call that Cecil got. The villains take down the Guardians, and Battle Beast complains that he was offered worthy opponents but he found none. Samson recovers but his suit malfunctions, and Battle Beast beats Invincible with his mace and licks his blood from his lips.

Samson jettisons his armor and attacks Beast, who easily breaks Samson's fist and slams him against the floor repeatedly. Monster Girl attacks next, and Beast easily beats him to a pulp. Robot fires an energy cannon at Beast, and the alien just chuckles as Rex, Dupli-Kate, and Shrinking Rae join Robot. The heroes say that the villains just messed up, and attack as a team, Beast says that the battle is beneath him and teleports away.

Robot cradles Monster Girl as she transforms back to her human form, and Machine Head discovers that Isotopes has fled, just before Rex knocks out the crime boss. Titan tells the barely conscious Invincible that he didn't mean for it to end the way it did but he has to take care of his own.

At the center, Amber and Eve serve food. Amber tells Eve that she thought Mark would be there.

A GDA squad arrive and tend to the fallen heroes. Cecil tells Donald to do whatever it takes to bring Invincible back, and get a sample to the lab. As the soldiers take Machine Head away, Cecil removes the chip from the crime boss's skull.

At the center, Eve gets a call. She then tells Amber that she has to go.

The medics take Samson away, while Robot tells the unconscious Monster Girl that he's there for her.

As Omni-Man flies back, Debbie gets off the phone. Crying, she turns to her husband.

Eve tells Amber that Mark loves Amber and he'd be there if he could. She then walks out.

A GDA helicopter takes the injured heroes away. Isotope teleports into the penthouse and tells his secret boss--Titan--that his plan worked. Vanessa and Fiona come in, and Fiona runs to her father. She asks if the penthouse is their new house, and Titan smiles.

At the GDA, Donald goes to a secret level. A scientist tells him that nothing they can throw at the Viltrumite cell samples can harm them. Donald figures that blood is still the answer, and the scientists should keep trying."

The male student, Doug Cheston, lunges out at them, drunk, and ""surprises"" them. Doug boasts that he's been drinking, and that his father owns Cheston Pharmaceutical and owns half the university. One of the women points out that Doug's father hiked up the cost of baby medicine, and Doug readily admits that his father did and that soon Doug is going to inherit his father's money.

Doug asks if they want to have sex with him and get in on the ""ground floor"" of his inheritance. Disgusted, the women walk off. Once they leave, a figure dressed all in black grabs Doug and injects him in the neck with a sedative.

Later, Doug wakes up strapped to a gurney. His captor, wearing goggles, tells Doug that he's going through a metamorphosis and will be better than before. Doug calls his captor a nerd, and the overhead light swings to reveal partially-cybernetic corpses strung up from the ceiling. Seeing them, Doug panics and looks down, and discovers that his right arm has been replaced with a replacement mechanical arm. His captor then cuts out Doug's vocal chords with a scalpel, and tells Doug that he'll be better than the prototypes.

Medics brings Invincible, Samson, and Monster Girl into the hospital, and on the OR table Monster Girl transforms into her monstrous form, goes berserk, and then passes out. Robot comes in and tells the doctors that he's familiar with Monster Girl's physiology, and they can have security remove him or they can save Monster Girl's life. The doctors let Robot stay, and he goes to the unconscious Monster Girl and tells her that he's there. Robot tells the doctors to begin an infusion of belladonna and wolfsbane.

Other doctors tend to Samson and try to shock his heart into working. Energy surges from Samson's body, and his heart starts.

Nolan and Debbie arrive and watch from the gallery as doctors operate on Invincible. Cecil and Donald join them, and Debbie and Nolan start arguing about their son. Later, Mark wakes up to find his parents at his bedside. They tell him that he's been out for six days, and Mark says that he was supposed to meet Amber. Eve comes in and says that she told Amber that Mark was hit by a bus. She says that Samson and Monster Girl are still unconscious, and Debbie tells her son that it isn't his fault.

Cecil watches through the observation window as Robot sits at Monster Girl's bedside. Nolan is with Cecil, and offers to take a swing at Damien if he hasn't said anything about the Guardians. Cecil refuses, and Nolan asks if Damien murdered the Guardians. The GDA director is more interested in why Damien would do it, and asks Nolan if Mark told him he was taking on Machine Head by himself. Nolan says that Mark told him he wasn't going off to the crime boss, and Nolan insists that children don't disobey their parents on Viltrum. Cecil tells Nolan that human kids do and walks away.

Mark visits Amber at her house, and he says that the hospital has rules about letting visitors in. Amber tells Mark that she had already dumped him the night he missed their ""date"" at the center. Mark admits that he messed up his first call to her, but Amber let him start over. He asks if they can do that again, and she finally agrees. They kiss and fall down on Amber's bed.

Later at school, Will tells Mark that he needs to watch traffic. Mark suggests that they catch a movie the next Friday because they haven't hung out in a while, and Will says that he's going to Upstate U for a tour, and his former boyfriend Rick Sheridan is there. Will is staying over, and he's going to check out their pre-med program. Mark tells Will that he wants to come and bring Amber, and Will considers.

Later in his room, Mark is packing when Atom Eve flies up to his window. Mark lets her in and thanks her for covering with him with Amber. Mark explains that he, Amber, and Will are going to Upstate for a tour, and invites Eve along. Eve says that she's skipping college, and just wants to help people directly instead of fighting super-villains.

Mark tells Atom Eve that he messed up, and Samson and Monster Girl almost died because of him. Because of that, he understands what Atom Eve is going through and maybe they both need a fresh start. Amber and Will arrive, and Atom Eve falls off.

The trio drive off in Will's car, and Will talks a lot about Rick. Back at the Grayson house, Debbie tells Nolan that she's going out. When he offers to go with her, Debbie reminds him that he said he had work to do on his book. Once Debbie leaves, Nolan gets his bloodstained costume from where he hid it.

The trio arrive at Upstate U, and Will insists that he's not in love with Rick despite talking about him non-stop. Rick greets them and hugs Will, and Rick takes them to his dorm room where he's putting them up.

Eve moves out despite her parents' protests, and tells her mother that she needs a fresh start. Her father Adam says that he isn't going to let her ruin her life on some ""find yourself bullshit"", and if she wants a fresh start she should stop being a superhero. Adam tells Eve that she can't save the world, and trying will get her killed. He says that the worst day of his life was when she got powers, and he wants a normal life for her. Eve tells Adam that that's what best for him, not her, and flies off.

Rick shows the trio around the dorm, and says that he's arranged a biology class sit-in for them. At the class, the professor talks about how they focus on quality of life. Student DA Sinclair speaks up, disagreeing, and Rick tells the others that Sinclair is there on a genius grant.

Sinclair rants about how human failings are engineering challenges, and they need to realize that humans are machines that need to be improved. Amber tells Sinclair that he's being a jerk, and he tells them that his problem is how the university is staffed by idiots. Sinclair tells Rick that he's impressive--a classic alpha male-and the professor tells Sinclair to leave and return when he's ready to learn. Sinclair tells Rick that he'll see him at exams and leaves, and the professor returns to his lecture.

Eve flies over the forest and uses his powers to make a treehouse when she finds a spot with a good view.

As the quarter check out the quad, Rick suggests that the two couple split up, and Will quickly agrees so he'll be alone with Rick. Amber and Mark go off, look around, order foot from a street cart vendor, and end up kissing. Later, they settle on a bench and watch people go by, and Mark tells Amber that he likes it there. He asks Amber what she thinks of them coming there together, and Amber tells Mark that he has to get his grades up. He says that he wants to be there with Amber, and Amber agrees.

As Will and Rick join Mark and Amber, there's an explosion in a nearby building. A cyborg Reaniman staggers out, clutching at his helmet and lunging at the pedestrians. Amber yells at everyone to get bac, and a couple trips. Amber goes to help them and calls for the others to help them, while the Reaniman throws a van. As Mark prepares to fight the Reaniman, Amber calls him over to help.

The Reaniman, formerly Doug, grabs Rick, and Will throws cans at the cyborg's head and yells at the Reaniman to get away from Rick. Doug jumps over and grabs Will by the throat, and Mark change into his Invincible costume and frees Will from Doug's grasp. As the two grapple, Will recognizes Mark despite his mask, and Invincible tells Will to run. Doug shoves Invincible's head into a decorative fountain basin, but Invincible eventually frees himself and slams Doug into the pavement.

Doug recovers and starts beating Invincible. Invincible manages to rip off Doug's helmet, and stagger off. The Reaniman goes after him, but sees the reflection of his face in the basin water and withdraws back in shock. He jumps on a decorative statue in the basin and impales himself,

Invincible goes over to Will, who shares at his friend in shock. He tells Will not to tell anyone his identity, then flies off as Amber and Rick come over. Rick hugs Will and thanks him for saving his life, and Will hugs him back. Mark runs up in his civilian clothes and says that the police are on the way, and Amber angrily asks where he went. Mark says that he ran for help, but Amber accuses him of being a coward. She says that she and Eve were wrong about Mark, breaks into tears, and walks off.

Sinclair comes up, picks up the Reaniman's discarded helmet, and says it's the last time he'll leave any of his subjects' frontal lobes intact. He studies Rick, and figures he'd make a suitable subject.

At her treehouse, Atom Eve brings up news photos of disasters and flies off to deal with one of them.

A badly damaged Robot drone staggers into the GDA room where the doctors are tending to the comatose Monster Girl. It holds out a single cerulean cosmos flower, and Robot takes it and explains the doctors that he sent a drone to the Arctic to get the flower. The flower contains a single molecule that adds 60% to Monster Girl's chance of survival. Robot gives it to the doctors and instructs them on how to extract the necessary compounds, then call Robot for isolation and purification.

Once the doctors leave, Robot sits at Monster Girl's beside. Samson is the next bed, and says that Robot really cares for Monster Girl. He wonders how a machine has emotions, and Robot says that he's programmed to care for all humans. Samson doesn't believe him and asks if they won, and Robot stares at him.

Debbie goes to Art, who is examining Omni-Man's bloodstained costume. He says that he's spent the analyzing it like she asked, and has confirmed it shows samples of various Guardians on it. Debbie suggests that maybe the Guardians attacked Omni-Man and he defended himself, but Art uses the oxidation patterns of the blood to confirm that Omni-Man struck first. She asks Art not to tell anyone, and he says he's too scared to tell anyone, while outside, Nolan hovers in the air and listens in.

Back in Rick's dorm room, Amber tells Mark that there's no way she's sharing a room with him and throws his pack at him before going into their room alone. Rick tells Mark that he can bunk with him and Will, and Rick goes to get some food. Amber goes to take a shower, and Will gushes over Mark being Invincible.

Atom Eve puts out a forest fire with her powers, regrows the destroyed trees, saves two hikers from an avalanche, and grows plants on a farm.

Robot visits the Maulers, who are growing a creature for him in a tank, and tells them that their progress is satisfactory. They ask who it's for and whose DNA did Robot steal, and Robot says that their work doesn't require answers to their questions. Robot tells them that they'll be paid when their work is complete, and the Maulers threaten to destroy the creature. Robot tells them that they'll get the schematics when their work is done, and the Maulers back down.

Once Robot leaves, the Maulers figure they need some ""insurance"" and one tells the other to grab a shovel.

Will continues to question Mark about Invincible, and points out that Mark never told him even though he's his best friend. Mark says that he doesn't even want to be Invincible anymore, and Will says that Mark is being a superhero is the coolest thing that's ever happened to him. Mark isn't sure that Amber will forgive him, and Will agrees. Will then jokingly says that Mark should take him flying or he'll tell everyone that Mark is Invincible. Mark flies Will out and back at superspeed, and Will asks to try on the costume.

As Amber returns from the shower, fraternity bro Kyle startles Amber from behind and gives her a flyer for his fraternity's party later that night. She takes the flyer.

Rick leaves a convenience store and Facetimes Will to ask if he should get some pizza. Rick's call cuts out in mid-conversation, and Will goes to tell Mark. Mark shows Will the flyer and says that Amber got invited to a party, and wonders if he should have gone after her. He'd rather go after Amber, and refuses to help Will, saying that whenever he tries to be a superhero he makes things worse. Mark tells Will to call him if he can't find Rick, but he has to go after Amber.

At the hospital, Samson dresses and tells Robot that he feels better than ever. Robot tells Samson to rejoin the team at Guardians HQ, while he'll remain there until Monster Girl recovers. Once Samson leaves, Monster Girl wakes up and is shocked to find Robot hovering over her. She apologizes for her reaction and Robot tells her that they won the battle., and assures her that her teammates are fine. When Robot says that he stayed with her through her recovery, Monster Girl is surprised and touched.

He gets up to go, offers Art a last beer, and says that he just wanted to make sure their ""partnership"" was still strong.

Mark goes into the party, looking for Amber. He sees her out on the balcony talking to Kyle, and he mentions that his girlfriend is transferring there next semester. Kyle asks Amber if she's seeing anyone, and Amber says that she was. Meanwhile, Will calls Mark and on a staticky call, tells Mark that he's in trouble. The line goes dead, and Mark leaves.

One of the REANIMAN carries Will to Sinclair's hidden lair, puts him on a gurney, and straps him down. Sinclair comes in, carrying a surgical saw.

Invincible flies over the campus looking for Will, and flies into the hole to the sewers that Doug came up from. He flies through the sewer looking for Will, and three Reaniman attack him. They knock him into Sinclair's lair, where Sinclair is ""operating"" on Will. Sinclair says that he's ""improved"" the Reaniman since Invincible fought Doug, and the Reanimen continue beating Invincible. The student insists that he's fixing humanity' weakness.

Invincible rips off one of his attacker's helmets, and Will realizes the Reaniman is Rick. Sinclair says that he removed Rick's emotions, and Will reminds Rick of the sex they had at a lake a year ago. Sinclair cuts Will's arm with his saw, and Rick sees it calls Will's name, and cries. Sinclair sees it, and Rick pulls the control plate out of the back of his head, then fights back against the other two Reanimen beating Invincible.

Will drives back with Amber and Mark, and Amber turns the radio up when Mark tries to talk to her.

At her treehouse, Atom Eve uses her powers to make coffee and refreshes herself from her previous day's exertions. She looks up more disasters on her phone, and goes up on the roof to sip coffee and watch the sunrise.

Debbie asks Nolan why he kept his incriminating costume, and he says that he used it to take care of Damien but part of him might have wanted Debbie to find it. Nolan says that he wanted to tell Debbie the truth months ago, and she asks her husband if he was mind-controlled or blackmailed. Nolan says that didn't happen, and Debbie needs to trust him and if she does, their family will be okay. Debbie says that she can't trust him, and knows almost nothing about Nolan.

Nolan insists that he had no choice but to kill the Guardians, and Debbie says that she doesn't trust Nolan and orders him out of her house. When Nolan says that she doesn't mean, Debbie throws his blood-soaked costume at him and repeats her demand. Nolan throws the costume on the floor, says that they'll talk later, and flies through the ceiling.

Invincible removes his mask and reveals that he's Mark, and says that's why he's always late. Amber ignores him at first, and finally says that she knows he's a superhero.

A van pulls up to the Maulers' base and drives in. they shoot at the driver, who doesn't respond. They discover that he's a hologram, and Robot comes out of the back. The creature the Maulers have been creating comes out of the van next, still in its cylinder which is suspended in a robot spider carriage. The Maulers realize that it's the real Robot, and that they've been growing Robot a new body.

Robot has them show him the teenage body they've been cloning. The Robot body analyzes it and says that it's perfect, except for the poisonous sacs the Maulers planted in as well as control synapses. The body says that he'll pay them with a GDA control collar as soon as they remove the secret mechanisms they put in the body and do one last upgrade.

When the Maulers demand their payment first, the Robot mechanical body dissolves and the body says that he's alone and helpless. One of the Twins tells the other to do what Robot wants, and the other Twin puts in the upgrade, a neural link.

At the GDA, Donald takes Debbie to a control room where Cecil is waiting. Debbie tells Cecil that Nolan killed the Guardians, and when Cecil says that he knows, she slaps him. She asks how he could know and not tell her, and Cecil explains that he couldn't risk Nolan finding out that they knew until they figured out why he did it and how to stop him.

Debbie wonders if Cecil means to kill Nolan, and Cecil says that he's not sure they can. Donald nods and leaves, and Cecil tells Debbie that he only knows of one person who might be able to go head-to-head with Omni-Man. Debbie realizes who he's talking about and says that he can't, and Cecil ignore her and asks where Mark is.

Omni-Man flies to a mountaintop and rehearses a speech to Mark about how he had to kill the Guardians. He insists that it was his responsibility to do it, and figures that Mark can understand it when no one else does. Omni-Man stops, wonders what he's doing, and flies off.

Robot's organic body tells the Maulers that he didn't intend to leave his cocoon, but he met someone. The maulers put a rebreather on him and put a copy of his consciousness into the teenage body. They compensate for the original's dense neuron system, which threatens to overload their power source. The machinery blows up from the power overload anyway, but the copy process is completed.

The teenage body gets up and wonders which he is, and the Maulers tell him that they had to make the transfer seamless. The original Robot is still alive, and the original tells the teenage Robot to be happy it was him that survived and to change the world, and experience everything they ever could. The teenager wonders if they both can live, and the original reminds him that the plan was that the original die, and he wants to die. Crying, the teenager removes the rebreather and kills his original body.

The Mauler says that they know the teenager did an act of mercy, and they do it all the time. They demand the schematics, and Robot the teenager gives them a flash drive from his mobile cocoon. He tells them that it's time for them to go back to prison, and they just laugh.

The teenager points out that he's a 30-year-old genius with a neural link they just installed for him. He activates two Robot drones. The Twins defeat them, and Robot converts the van into a giant robot and attacks the Twins with it.

Cecil and Debbie are watching from the control room, Omni-Man survives the explosion, and Debbie tells Cecil that Omni-Man is going to find Mark, and she doesn't know who Omni-Man is or what he's going to do. Cecil figures that they'd better find Mark first.

Mark flies up and approaches Atom Eve.

Robot tells the Twins that they will come back to prison with him, and one of the twins grabs some equipment while the other one draws the robot's fire. Working together, one of the Twins completes the gun he's making and shoots at Robot, and the robot shields him. The gun runs out of charge, and the Twins runs as the robot shoots at them. Robot gets a call from Cecil on his comm for all Guardians to come to their HQ, because there's an apocalypse-level priority. Meanwhile, the robot shoots at the clones and misses, blowing a hole in the ceiling.

Will is driving home. Omni-Man lands in front of him and demands to know where Mark is. The teenager tells Omni-Man that Amber dumped Mark, and Mark went to find Eve. Omni-Man tells Will to call Mark, and Will says that Mark's phone is broken. When Omni-Man asks where Eve is, Will remembers Mark telling him that Eve is at her treehouse. With that, Omni-Man flies off.

When the Guardians arrive at their HQ, Cecil tells then to sit tight until he calls on them. Rex demands to know what's going on, but Cecil repeats his order and signs off. The Robot drone is inactive, and the Robot teenager comes in and says that he's more alive than other. Robot says that his real name is Rudolph Connors, and Robot was a drone that he controlled remotely. Rex wonders why Rudy looks like him, and Rudy says that his story can wait until the crisis is resolve.

Cecil's people spot Invincible and Atom Eve flying across the countryside, and that Omni-Man is closing in on their location. Cecil figures that they need to buy some time, and tells his people to ""bring the hammer down"".

Invincible and Atom Eve land at a waterfall and sit, and Invincible tells Atom Eve that Amber dumped him. He doesn't know who he is or who he's supposed to be, and Atom Eve says that she's saved more lives in the last three days then in the last three years as a member of the Teen Team. She figures that she should call her mom.

The GDA fires an orbital laser at Omni-Man, blasting apart the land nearby. Omni-Man is unharmed, flies up at the satellite, and destroys it as it fires at him again. After he notices that his nose is bleeding, Omni-Man destroys a drone transmitting video of him to Cecil. The hero then heads back toward Invincible and Atom Eve, and Cecil tells his people power up the teleporter.

Rudy tells the Guardians what happened, and Rex asks him why he chose to look like him. Monster Girl realizes that Rudy did it for her, and Rudy says that they're prisoners in their own bodies. Rudy offers to help Monster Girl escape her ""prison"", and says that he adopted Rex's DNA because he noticed that Monster Girl found Rex interesting. Rex is creeped out.

Monster Girl points out all the crimes that Rudy committed to be with her, and says that she needs time to process it. Samson detects Omni-Man destroying the satellite and shows the others.

Atom eve sees the destruction of the satellite, and says that they should check in with Cecil. Mark tells her that they're both done with all that, and she says that she isolated herself to start over. However, Atom Eve insists that doesn't mean she's going to ignore the world when it needs her. Mark tells her that the world was fine before he came along and will be fine without his help, and Atom Eve tells him that he'll feel worse if he just sits there when he could save lives. Disgusted, Atom Eve flies off.

Cecil teleports ahead of Omni-Man and shoots him with a blaster to get his attention. He teleports away when Omni-Man tries to grab him, and asks why Omni-Man killed the Guardians. Omni-Man says that they were weak, and Cecil figures that Omni-Man had a reason for killing them. Cecil continues teleporting away and back when Omni-Man attacks him, and Cecil asks him about Debbie. Omni-Man tells Cecil not to speak her name, and Cecil points out that Omni-Man is the one who hurt her, not him.

Cecil points out that Omni-Man fooled them all for 20 years, and asks if Mark knows that his father is a murderer. He asks what Mark is going to do when he finds out, and Omni-Man points out that Cecil can't stop him. Cecil admits that he can't, and all he's doing is buying them a little more time. Omni-Man tries to grab Cecil at superspeed, and Cecil teleports back to the GDA control room, part of his tie in Omni-Man's hand.

Three pods crash down around Omni-Man, and Reanimen emerge from them and attack Omni-Man. They knock him down and beat him, and he flies up with them still on him. Another drone watches from nearby, transmitting the images to Cecil and Debbie. Cecil tells Debbie that the Reanimen are dead soldiers, serving their county thanks to Sinclair, who is nearby in a neck brace after Invincible hit him.

Omni-Man kills the Reanimen, and a technician tells Cecil that Invincible and Atom Eve are on the move again and will intercept Omni-Man in four minutes. Omni-Man destroys the new drone, and another one takes its place. Sinclair flies into a rage, and Cecil has his soldiers take him away. Cecil then has the ""hail Mary'--the kaiju that Omni-Man fought in Tokyo--teleported to Omni-Man.

The Maulers suture Immortal's head back on his body, and then put the control collar that they built from Rudy's collar on the resurrected Immortal.

Omni-Man flies across the wheat fields, and the kaiju teleports in front of him and knocks him down. Realizing that Cecil is listening via the drone, Omni-Man says that he beat the kaiju already. Cecil replied that they've removed its pain center, juiced it up with every drug and enhancement they had, and it's pissed off from its treatment and blames Omni-Man.

Two news helicopters move in on the fight, and the Guardians watch the newscast. Cecil tells the Guardians to stay where they are, and if the kaiju doesn't work then they're the world's last hope against Omni-Man. Rex figures that Omni-Man killed the original Guardians, and looks at the bloodstain Cecil had his people leave on the wall.

The kaiju overwhelms Omni-Man, and a technician tells Cecil that they can't teleport him to Invincible because teleporting the kaiju temporarily overloaded their systems. They call Atom Eve via her phone on Debbie's suggestion.

As the kaiju prepares to swallow Omni-Man, Invincible and Atom Eve arrive and Invincible flies to his father's defense. Meanwhile, Debbie calls Atom Eve, who tells Debbie that she just missed Invincible.

Invincible catches Omni-Man, and says that it's about time they did a team-up. Meanwhile, Cecil tells Atom Eve to do nothing except go to Guardian HQ. The kaiju grabs Invincible, and Debbie tells Cecil to call the kaiju off. Cecil tells Debbie that he can't, because it's the only remaining weapon he has against Omni-Man and he doesn't know if Invincible is with Omni-Man or against him.

The Twins activate Immortal, but he doesn't come to life. One of them pounds on the Immortal's chest. Immortal remembers bits of his long life, including Omni-Man killing him, and awakens, and goes berserk. The Twins are unable to control him with the collar to kill the Guardians, and Immortal flies off.

Invincible and Omni-Man manage to take down the kaiju, and Omni-Man tells his son that Cecil sent the kaiju after him. He tells Invincible that there's a lot he doesn't know, and the kaiju revives, grabs Invincible, and knocks Omni-Man away. Meanwhile, Cecil gets a report that Immortal is approaching the battle site.

Immortal attacks Omni-Man, taking him by surprise. The helicopters broadcast video of the fight across the globe, and Omni-Man recovers, beat off Immortal, and sees the kaiju slamming Invincible into the ground.

Invincible grabs some nearby power lines and electrocutes the kaiju, while Omni-Man drives his fist through Immortal's stomach. Will, Amber, and the Guardians watch the video, and Monster Girl takes Rudy's hand. Immortal dries his thumbs into Omni-Man's eyes, and Omni-Man rips him in half. Invincible stares at his father in shock, and Omni-Man tells him that they need to talk."

Invincible takes in his blood-covered father, punches him, and says that someone must he controlling him. Omni-Man tells his son to stop and breaks his grip, and says that he isn't being controlled.

Omni-Man tells Invincible that it's time for his son to know where he really comes from. He explains that he's from Viltrum, and the natives reached their full potential by removing the weak. When it was over, the Viltrumite population was cut in half and what emerged from the ashes was unstoppable. The Viltrumite survivors decided they would be the only empire, and swept out across the galaxy. Some species resisted, but no one could withstand them for long and the Viltrum Empire encompassed thousands of planets.

With their expansion, the Viltrumites were spread too thin. The most trusted officers were each given a planet to weaken. Omni-Man was chosen for Earth, came there, married Debbie, and they had a son: Mark.

Now, Omni-Man and Invincible need to work together to get Earth ready to join the Viltrum Empire. Omni-Man says that it's good news, and they can finally be who they were meant to be. He says that he couldn't tell the truth until Invincible had his powers and Omni-Man was sure that Invincible was a Viltrumite. Invincible insists that Omni-Man loves him and Debbie, His father tells him that Viltrumites, and Invincible, will live for thousands of years. Everyone Invincible knows and loves will be dead before he looks 30, and they can help humans by stopping wars

Invincible is shocked when Omni-Man says that Debbie is more like a pet to him, and says that he isn't going to enslave his friends for aliens that he's never met .Omni-Man says that he can't let Invincible interfere, and Invincible braces himself to fight.

Omni-Man punches Invincible to the ground below, and easily catches Invincible's next punch. He then throws Invincible away and flies after him, while Cecil's people track them via the drones. Debbie tells Cecil that her husband and son will kill each other, and Cecil has to stop them. Cecil orders his people to scramble jets out of Chicago, to distract Omni-Man so Invincible can think of something.

The Guardians watch from their base, and Rudy says that they follow Cecil's orders and stay there. Samson agrees, and Atom Eve flies in and Rex hugs her in relief. The others tell her what's going on with Invincible and Omni-Man, and Rudy warns that Invincible will have to be invincible to face Omni-Man and survive.

Omni-Man and Invincible continue fighting, and the fighters circle them. When Omni-Man throws Invincible to the ground, the pilots open fire. The missiles have no effect on Omni-Man, and he smashes through one fighter. The pilot plummets toward the ground, and Invincible flies up and catches him.

The ejector seat's chute ejects, knocking Invincible away. He flies back, recatches the pilot, pulls him out of the seat just before it crashes into the ground, and lands nearby. As the pilot thanks Invincible, Omni-Man lands behind the pilot, grabs his skull, and crushes it to demonstrate to Invincible the futility of saving him. Omni-flies up after the other pilot, and Invincible grabs his father before he can bring down the other jet. Omni-Man says that it made no difference that the pilot died when he would have died of old age anyway.

Omni-Man punches Invincible into the city, devastating the streets. Invincible recovers and looks around at the destruction caused by his fall. A building he was smashed through starts to fall, and Invincible flies up to catch it. A mother and daughter fall out the window as the building tilts over, and Ii grabs the mother by the hand as the daughter holds onto the edge. The building collapses despite Invincible's efforts.

Cecil and Debbie watch the carnage from the GDA monitor room.

Invincible climbs out and discovers that he is clutching the mother's severed arm. He drop it and collapses sobbing to his knees, and Omni-Man flies down and says that it was Invincible's fault because of his stubbornness against the inevitable. He asks Invincible how many more need to die, and it's up to Invincible. Omni-Man says that Invincible knows that he's right, and Invincible asks him if Debbie's life is worthless. His father says that in the grand scheme of things it is. Listening, Debbie breaks into tears.

Furious, Invincible attacks Omni-Man, who stops him and tells his son that for the first time in his life, he's telling Invincible the truth. He slams Invincible into the subway below, then holds him up as a subway train approaches. It slams into them, shatters around Ii, and crashes into the station.

When the crash is over, Omni-Man tells Invincible that the people are meaningless. Invincible says that Omni-Man is wrong, and he's seen his father die to protect humanity. He figures that Omni-Man was a Viltrumite when he came to Earth, but he's changed and was happy there. Omni-Man concedes that he was happy for a time, but he's loyal to Viltrumite.

Invincible attacks Omni-Man again, who easily dodges his blows and flies him up into the sky. Invincible breaks free, and Omni-Man grabs him again and says that he'll burn the planet down rather than live among the ""animals"" for another minute. He punches Invincible repeatedly up into the clouds, then says that he was wrong to raise Invincible as a human and should have prepared him better.

Samson says that they can still save lives and should move out. When Rudy says that Cecil's orders were to stay there, Dupli-Kate tells him that they don't care. Monster Girl tells Rudy that he's not a robot anymore, takes Rudy's hand, and they go with the others.

Omni-Man slams Invincible into the ocean bottom, then takes him up through an ocean liner and throws his son into a mountain. The impact causes an avalanche that buries Invincible and wipes out the town below. Omni-Man asks Invincible if he's had enough yet. When Invincible says he'll stop Omni-Man yet, Omni-punches him into another mountain and insists that Earth joining the Viltrum Empire will make it better than it ever was. He says that they're to show the humans how wrong they are if they resist.

When Invincible doesn't yield, Omni-Man beats him and says that he can start again with another son. As he shatters Invincible's teeth, Omni-Man remembers when he and Debbie watches a tooth-gapped Mark playing baseball as a child. Nolan isn't thrilled with wasting his time watching the game, and it's a waste of everyone's time. Debbie says that they made Mark, and when their son feels joy, his parents feel joy.

Mark hits a home run and runs the bases. Debbie tells Nolan that their children remind them of the joys in life, and that's humanity. Nolan smiles and cheers Mark as his son slides into home base and is safe Debbie and Nolan hug, and Mark runs over and joins them. Nolan picks up his son and says that he saw it.

In the present, Omni-Man looks at the bloody and beaten Invincible. He curses and collapses next to Invincible, then yells at Invincible asking why he made his father beat him. Omni-Man yells that Invincible is fighting so that he can eventually see everyone around him die. He asks what Invincible will have after 500 years, and Invincible says that he'll still have his father. Omni-Man stares at his son's blood on his hands, then flies off the planet, grief-stricken.

Cecil approaches her and says that they're preserving Nolan's secret identity as Omni-Man to protect his family, by saying that Nolan died in the house explosion across the street. Nolan's travel books will sell well after his death, and they sent proxies of Debbie and Mark to Nolan's funeral.

Debbie thanks Cecil for his cover-up, and Cecil says that Nolan fooled him and he's trying to make things as right as he can for Debbie and Mark.

The Guardians return to their base, exhausted from their rescue efforts, and Rex cleans the bloodstain ""reminder"" off the wall. Samson says that they haven't earned it, and when Rcx ignores him, Samson grabs his soldier. The other Guardians prepare to attack Samson, and Samson tells Rex that now they look like a team. The others join Rex in his efforts.

Mark wakes up, and Cecil tells him that it's a hell of a thing that he did. Cecil explains that Mark has been unconscious for almost two weeks, and tells Mark to rest when he asks where Omni-Man went. Mark goes after Cecil, and admits that he doesn't know if he still wants to be a hero. Cecil tells Mark to come with him, and takes him to a blank white room. He says that Debbie heard everything Omni-Man said, so Mark doesn't have to explain it to her. Cecil explains that Debbie deserved the truth, and she was holding out hope that Omni-Man had a good reason for killing the Guardians.

Mark agrees and wonders where they are, and Cecil turns on the lights the camouflage and reveals a secret weapons workshop. Immortal's body is there, being examines. Cecil turns the lights back off, and explains that people are fed chemicals in their room that prevent them from seeing certain frequencies of lights, and the frequencies are used in the room. He then tells Mark that Omni-Man flew out of the solar system and the galaxy, and they need a replacement.

Mark says that he won't be a hero yet, because it's too much. Cecil takes Mark and Debbie to their home, and says that they fixed it and did everything to cover up Debbie and Mark's absences from work and school. He tells them to call him if they need anything else and leaves.

Inside, Debbie goes to lie down and Mark looks at a photo of his family. He remembers his father telling him that he and Mark have responsibilities as Viltrumites, that normal humans don't. When Mark remembers Omni-Man beating him, he angrily slaps the photo face down.

Discovering that the refrigerator is empty, Mark calls upstairs to Debbie that he's going to order them something for dinner. When Debbie doesn't respond, Mark goes upstairs and sees Debbie on her bed, crying. She doesn't see Mark, and he quietly leaves.

The doorbell rings, and Mark answers it to find Amber there. She hugs him and says that they can together if Mark wants. Amber has figured out that Omni-Man is Mark's father Nolan, and asks if he wants to talk about it. Mark says that he thinks he does.

He gets a call from Cecil saying that he needs Mark, and Mark excuses himself to talk to Cecil privately. Cecil tells Mark that some is flying toward Earth from deep space, and they don't know who it is.

They sit on the moon and Invincible tells Allen the situation. Allen says that Viltrumites don't just give up, and they blew up Allen's planet rather than lose. The alien says that the Coalition of Planets is trying to unite enough worlds to stop the Viltrumites, and figures Omni-Man abandoning his post could be the advantage they're looking for. Invincible smiles, and says that he's learned Earth is just a small part of a bigger situation makes it all feel more manageable.

Chuck (Gavan O'Herihly) bounces a basketball through the living room as Richie comes home and asks Howard (Tom Bosley) if he can go to the party instead of visiting with his Aunt Bessie. Howard gives him permission to go, telling him to take it easy.

Richie and Potsie drink a large amount of milk to prevent themselves from getting drunk, but Fonzie (Henry Winkler) suggests olive oil instead, which Potsie cannot get at Arnold's.

They go to the party, where they notice all of the beer and are passed cards with dirty pictures on them. Potsie gets some olive oil and they drink some as the drinking games start. However, they soon become drunk and the entertainment, Verna LaVerne is brought out and after her performance, she takes the intoxicated Richie home.

After Richie gets sick, Howard takes him back to his bedroom, and sits on his bed as he holds a wet washcloth over his forehead, Richie explains to his dad that his sickness must have been maybe something that didn't agree with his stomach, Richie then removes the washcloth from his head and tells his dad they drank 72 beers. Marion makes Richie some coffee and Howard decides not to punish Richie, as he feels he has already been punished by his drunkenness. Before he goes to bed Richie offers his dad a cigar.

Fonzie (Henry Winkler) struggles to start his bike as Richie and Potsie approach him to ask about joining the Demons. He reluctantly agrees to help them.

Howard (Tom Bosley) and Joanie (Erin Moran) paint as Richie prepares to go meet the Demons. Howard advises him to be smart.

Fonzie attends the Demons initiation with Richie and Potsie. They both make it past the first stage, then say they must do the ""deadly dares"" in order to be members.

At Arnold's, they are dared to make juvenile crank calls and kiss Marsha. They then are dared to roller skate through the hallway at school, stealing a teacher's toupee in the process. At the movie theater, they are dared to sing ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee"" and they are joined by the other people in the theater as well. In a screening room where Richie's family are present.

Howard gets a headache and while Marion (Marion Ross) goes to get aspirin, Richie apologizes for embarrassing them. At home, Howard suggests to Richie that the girls who fall for Demons may not be worth it. Later at Arnold's, as another dare, they tie a police officer's shoelaces together as he speaks to Marsha and plans a date with her. However, this is ruined when the officer falls on her and she thinks he is assaulting her.

The final dare for the boys to become Demons is to go to a school dance dressed as girls. Fonzie dances with Richie and when he learns that ""she"" is Richie, he claims to have known the whole time and was trying to help him.

Richie and Potsie later decide that they do not really want to be Demons, reflecting Howard's advice. And Joanie says she doesn't want to wear Richie's hand me downs."

He stares at a statue of a naked woman that is part of the waiting room. The door opens and Dr. Jennifer Melfi calls Tony into her office. Dr. Melfi offers Tony a seat and Tony sits down. The two sit in silence for several moments. Dr. Melfi breaks the silence and informs Tony that his family doctor, Dr. Cusamano, told her that he has collapsed. Dr. Melfi asks if it was a panic attack and asks him if he was unable to breathe. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that the doctors were the one that said it was a panic attack, but he doesn't believe that happened. He informs her that the blood and neurological work came back negative. The doctors then referred him to her office. Dr. Melfi asks why he doesn't think he had a panic attack. Tony doesn't respond to that question. Dr. Melfi asks Tony how he's feeling now. Tony insists he's feeling fine and is back at work now. Dr. Melfi asks Tony what kind of work he is in. Tony informs her that he is a waste management consultant. After a few more moments of silence, Tony tells Dr. Melfi that it is impossible for him to talk to a psychiatrist. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he has any idea as to why he blacked out. Tony says he thinks it might have been stress. Dr. Melfi asks what he could be stressed about. We then flashback to the day Tony had the panic attack. He narrates the events of the day. He says that when he woke up that morning he had been thinking. He thought it was good to be in something from the ground floor, but that lately he's been getting the feeling that he came in at the end. He thinks that he has already left the best years of his life behind and now it's over. Dr. Melfi notes that many Americans feel this way. As Tony walks out to get the morning paper, he notes that he thinks about his father and remembers that he never made it as far as he has. Despite that, Tony thinks that his father had a better life. He remembers that his father had his friends, a list of standards, and pride. Tony doesn't think that they have any of that today. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he had any of those feelings of loss before he collapsed. Tony admits he doesn't know. When Tony walks back up to the house, he looks at his pool and at the trees surrounding the pool. He then sees a flock of ducks come out of the trees and come into the pool. Tony notes that a few months ago two ducks had landed in his pool. Tony thinks that the ducks were from Canada and they were in mating season. They had ducklings while they were at his home and Tony would go out every day to feed the ducks some bread. Tony steps into the pool to give them some of the bread. Tony's daughter, Meadow, has a friend named Hunter Scangarelo pick her up for school. Hunter sees Tony in the pool and tells Meadow what Tony is doing. Meadow doesn't like the ducks and says that the yard smells like duck feces. Tony's wife, Carmela, tells the girls that they need to have more than orange juice for breakfast. She tells them that they need brain food for school. Tony and Carmela's son, Anthony Soprano, Jr. aka AJ, comes downstairs. Carmela wishes AJ a happy thirteenth birthday. Meadow snipes that AJ doesn't act thirteen. Hunter notes that the ducks probably made love in the pool. Meadow doesn't like to think about that and is even more disgusted when AJ puts his cookie in the jug of milk. Carmela offers the girls last night's dessert, but Meadow tells Carmela that she doesn't want any fattening food. Hunter asks Carmela how she is able to stay so skinny. Carmela looks outside at Tony playing with the ducks in the pool. She is not happy about the ducks either. Outside, Tony starts talking to the ducks and tells them that if they don't like the ramp he built them then he'll build another one with better wood. The ducks start to flap around and Tony calls for his family to come outside to watch the baby ducks fly. Everyone comes outside to see the ducks flapping around, but they really aren't as excited about the ducks as Tony is. Meadow notes that they could see the same thing on National Geographic and AJ remembers that they watched this yesterday morning. Back inside, Hunter is glad to hear that Meadow is coming with her and her family to Aspen during the Christmas break. Hunter says that last year, Skeet Ulrich was in Aspen and she met him. Carmela reminds Meadow that the deal was for her to keep her grades up and keep curfew until Christmas and then she is allowed to go. Meadow insists she knows that. Tony comes back inside and wishes everyone a good morning. He tells AJ happy birthday. Carmela asks Tony if he's going to be home in time for AJ's birthday party. Tony is reading a book on birds and isn't paying attention. Carmela asks him again and Tony tells her he's coming home early. Carmela notes that she isn't talking about that job. Back in the office, Tony tells Dr. Melfi that this isn't going to work. He really doesn't like to talk about his personal life. Dr. Melfi insists that he finish telling her about the day he collapsed. Tony recounts that he drove to work with his nephew, Christopher Moltisanti. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Christopher is still learning the business he's in. Tony says that Christopher is an example of what he was talking about before. Tony asks Christopher if he called Triborough Towers about the hauling contact. Christopher admits that he arrived home late last night and didn't want to wake the man up. Tony asks if he got up early to call, noting that he's in his office by 6:00 a.m. every morning. Christopher says he was nauseous last night and notes his mother told him not to come to work today. Tony notes that this is coming from a man that just bought a $60,000 Lexus. As they drive, Christopher spots an associate named Alexander Mahaffey standing with a woman. Tony tells Christopher to back up so they can talk to him. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Mahaffey had an outstanding loan that he owed him. Dr. Melfi asks Tony to stop for a minute and notes that she has no idea where the story is going. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that there are some ethical ground rules that they need to discuss. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that they do have doctor/patient confidentiality. She says that this can be revoked if she heard about a crime that took place. If that would come to her attention, she has to go to the authorities. Dr. Melfi remembers that Tony told her he was in waste management. Dr. Melfi also adds that Dr. Cusamano is also Tony's next door neighbor. She admits she doesn't know what happened with Mahaffey, but she's just telling him the rules. Tony tells her that they only had coffee. Of course, Tony is exaggerating about the coffee. Mahaffey was carrying coffee, but drops it at the sight of Tony and Christopher's car. Christopher gets out and grabs at Mahaffey. Mahaffey screams for help. Christopher and Mahaffey wrestle, and Mahaffey is able to get away. Tony backs up the car and starts to chase after Mahaffey. After a brief chase, Tony runs the car right into Mahaffey. Mahaffey's leg is clearly broken with a piece of his bone protruding from his left leg. Mahaffey shrieks in pain and can't believe Tony just ran him over. Tony looks at Mahaffey's leg and punches the bone that is broken. Mahaffey screams in pain and Tony asks Mahaffey where his money is. Tony starts to punch Mahaffey repeatedly in the face. Tony sees that many people are watching him beat up Mahaffey while Christopher is more concerned about the Lexus that Tony just dented. Christopher yells that it will take $3,000 to repair the Lexus. Christopher starts to kick Mahaffey and Tony asks Mahaffey where his money is. Mahaffey begs them to stop and promises that he'll get the money. Tony suggests that Mahaffey stop talking to people because he knows that Mahaffey has been telling other people that he is nothing compared to the previous generation of leaders. Tony and Christopher head back to the car. Before he gets in, Tony tells Mahaffey that he should be appreciative because he's right in front of the HMO which means he's covered. Tony and Christopher later arrive at Centanni's Meat Market where he has meetings with his own crew of the Mafia. Tony narrates to Dr. Melfi that the meeting was about a garbage-hauling company that he represents. However, we know that Tony is talking about different business. Tony asks crew member Salvatore ""Big Pussy"" Bonpensiero how Triborough Towers is coming along. Pussy tells Tony that the manager wants to make a contract with their associate, Dick Barone, but another company, the Kolar Sanitation is interfering. Barone notes that Kolar is a nationwide company. Pussy notes that the Kolar brothers are Czechoslovakian immigrants that are hauling paper, plastic, and aluminum for $7,000 less than what Barone is offering. Tony notes that Triborough pays them forty times more than that to steal a shop. Pussy says that Triborough Towers figures that if they can tell the Czechoslovakians no then he can tell them no at the price they are asking for. Pussy notes that the business is really changing. Christopher asks if there's something he can do about it. Tony asks Christopher if he's over his stomachache. Christopher says he's fine. Crew member Silvio Dante arrives and Tony asks him what he's doing here. Silvio says that his wife sent him down to pick up some meat for supper. Silvio asks Tony if he ever went to school with a man named Artie Bucco. Tony informs Dr. Melfi that he had a situation come up with his uncle later that day as well, but he can't go into too much detail with that. Dr. Melfi understands. Tony does admit that his uncle adds to his general stress level. Silvio meets with Tony later and tells him that his uncle, Corrado ""Junior"" Soprano, is going to kill Little Pussy Malanga. Tony asks why that matters. Silvio informs him that Junior wants to kill him in at Artie Bucco's restaurant. Tony isn't too thrilled about that. Tony and Christopher arrive at Artie's restaurant to find Junior enjoying a meal. Junior notes he was just talking about Tony and asks if AJ's birthday is tonight. Tony replies that it is. Tony warns Junior not to buy a big gift because they spoil AJ as much as it is. Tony sees Artie and greets him. Artie's wife, Charmaine, notices Tony and heads into the back. Artie tells Tony and Christopher to have a seat and he'll be with them in a minute. When they sit down, Christopher asks Tony if he knows what will happen if Malanga is killed in the restaurant. Tony knows it will ruin Artie's business. Christopher tells Tony that he needs to sit down and talk with Junior. Tony tells Dr. Melfi in the present that Junior is his father's brother. He notes Junior is a good guy, but is getting old and cranky. Tony remembers that Junior took him to Yankee games when he was little. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he loves Junior. Tony recounts that when he was young he remembers Junior telling his female cousins that he would never be a varsity athlete. Tony admits that was a huge hit to his self-esteem. Tony arrives at the house of his mother, Livia Soprano. Tony has to knock several times before Livia finally comes to the door. Tony kisses Livia and asks how she is. Livia doesn't respond, but Tony notes that Livia should get fresh air into the house. Livia asks Tony if he locked the door. Tony says he did, but really didn't and goes back to do that. Livia tell Tony that someone called the house after dark. Tony asks who did that. Livia says she never answered the phone because it was dark outside. Tony notes that he'll never understand why she won't answer the phone after it's dark. Tony notes that the phone is auditory while darkness is associated with the eyes. They don't go together. He understands why she wouldn't go outside after dark, but doesn't understand why she won't answer the phone. Livia mutters to herself that Tony knows everything. She offers him some eggplant for lunch. Tony tells her that he ate and mentions that he just saw Junior. Livia complains that Junior never comes to visit her despite being his sister-in-law. Tony asks if she remembers Artie. Livia remembers Artie and notes she talks to his mother. Livia notes that Artie's mother told her that Artie calls every day. Tony informs Livia that Junior is going to cause Artie a lot of problems. Livia notices that Tony has brought her a gift and asks what it is. Tony says it's a CD Player for her. Livia says she doesn't want it. Tony knows that she loves music and all of her favorites are on CDS. Tony turns on Pajama Game by Connie Francis, which Livia really likes. Tony tries to keep Livia happy and dances with her quickly. Livia isn't as enthusiastic and tells him to stop. Tony tells Livia that she needs to stay occupied. He remembers that when John died, Livia had said she would do things. Livia starts to sob and remembers that John was a saint. Tony remembers that he was, but reminds Livia that John is dead. Tony remembers that Livia was going to travel and volunteer for charities, but she's done nothing. Livia tells Tony to stop telling her how to live her life. Tony tells Livia that he is worried about her. Livia warns him not to start talking about the nursing home again. Tony yells that he talked about a retirement community, not a nursing home. He says that she would be able to interact with people her own age, travel, and participate in activities. Livia insists that she's seen the women in the nursing homes and all they do is babble like idiots. Livia tells Tony to eat his eggplant. Tony insists that he already ate lunch. Tony asks Livia to speak to Junior about not killing Malanga in Artie's restaurant. He knows that Junior respects her and will listen to her. Livia insists that if Junior has business with Artie, then Junior knows what he's doing. Tony asks Livia if she thinks he doesn't. Livia says that all she knows is that daughters take care of their mothers better than sons do. Tony retorts that he bought CDs for a broken record. Tony heads for the door and tells Livia that he expects to see her tonight at AJ's birthday with some of her baked ziti. Livia says she's only coming if she's picked up and brought home after the party. Livia says that she doesn't drive when the weather predicts rain. Tony tells her that she's healthy and it's good for her to drive. Tony tells her he has to go back to work. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that that night was AJ's birthday party. Tony notes that Carmela always invites their priest, Father Phil Intintola, to the house. AJ comes outside and tells Tony and Carmela that Livia just called and isn't coming to the party. He notes that Livia started to cry and then hung up the phone. Tony notes that Livia needs a purpose in life. Carmela states that Livia is stronger than Tony thinks she is. AJ asks if there's going to be no ziti and curses when there won't be any. Everyone tells him to watch his mouth. Tony lights up the grill and starts to cook some burgers. He lights up a cigar and watches the ducks fly around in the pool. This time, the ducks are able to fly into the air. They all fly off into the day. Tony is deeply saddened by the ducks leaving. Tony says he then felt like something went straight to his skull. Tony starts to breathe heavily and his cigar drops from his mouth. He drops the can of lighter fluid on the grill, clutches his chest, and falls to the ground. Meadow sees that Tony fainted and the family runs to him. The lighter fluid on the grill explodes and everyone takes cover. Carmela tells the children to call 911 while Silvio puts out the fire. Tony then appears in the hospital where he is getting a MRI. Tony recounts that Dr. Cusamano sent him to the hospital and they ran a lot of tests on him. Before he is sent into the MRI, Carmela comes into the room. Carmela came to give Tony some company. Tony notes it's 6:30 a.m. Tony asks about the children. Carmela tells him that they are worried about him. Carmela tells Tony that they will have AJ's birthday in a few weeks. Tony asks Carmela if the doctors think he has a brain tumor. Carmela states that they are about to find out. Tony remarks that Carmela's bedside manner isn't the best. Carmela notes he doesn't want to go through life without knowing. Tony notes that they had some good times and good years in their marriage. Carmela doesn't really care and notes that Tony is already starting with the nostalgia. Tony notes that no marriage is perfect. Carmela adds that when Tony has a woman on the side that really didn't help the situation. Tony insists that he isn't seeing the girl anymore. Tony asks Carmela about Father Intintola. Carmela tells him not to try that and insists that Father Intintola is only making her a better Christian. Tony notes that they all have different needs. Carmela retorts that the difference between her and him is that Tony is going to Hell when he dies. Before another word, Tony is put into the MRI. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that while he was getting tests done, Christopher was handling the garbage contract. Tony adds that he can't go into further detail on this either. Christopher waits in Centanni's Meat Market for the meeting. He practices some karate moves while he waits. A car pulls up to the market. Christopher lets the man in and the man introduces himself as Emil Kolar. Kolar tells Christopher that in the Czech Republic, they love pork as well, noting that they are meeting in a meat market. Kolar asks Christopher if he's ever had Czech sausage. Christopher jokes that he only thought Italian and Jimmy Dean's made sausages. Christopher notes that they learn a lot when they cross cultures. He gets out two beers for them to drink. Kolar tells Christopher that his Uncle Evzen doesn't know that he came to them about the deal. Kolar states that if they make progress tonight then he will tell him. Christopher says that they have to make some progress because this is the only way to stop the madness. Christopher states that business is changing and they are the younger generation full of change. Christopher asks Kolar if he went to high school in Poland. Kolar reminds Christopher that he isn't Polish. Christopher thought that Czechoslovakian is a type of Polack. Kolar insists that he came to the United States at age 9 and went to West Essex. Christopher starts to tell Kolar that his cousin played football against West Essex, but Kolar wants to get down to business and asks for the stuff. Christopher gets out the cocaine that Kolar wanted. Christopher gives Kolar a straw and tells him to sample the product. Kolar starts to snort the cocaine. When he does, Christopher walks over and picks up a pistol. While Kolar is bent over, Christopher shoots Kolar in the head. Kolar falls dead to the floor. Christopher fires three more shots into Kolar, and as he does, the shot shifts to pictures of Humphrey Bogart, Dean Martin, and Al Capone on the wall. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that the doctors continued to run test after test on him. Afterwards, Tony says he and Junior went to play a round of golf and have some lunch. Dr. Melfi notes that Tony has mentioned Junior quite a bit and asks him what the problem with him is. We go to Junior leaving Artie's restaurant, asking Tony who he thinks he is. Tony says that he is the person that says how things go. Tony insists that Artie's business is nice and is more proper than the suburbs. Tony asks Junior not to ruin Artie's life. Junior insists that Artie's restaurant, Vesuvio, is the only place where Malanga feels he is safe and has been eating there his entire life. Tony orders Junior to do the hit somewhere else. Junior retorts that Tony may run North Jersey, but he doesn't run him. Junior reminds Tony of the countless hours they played catch together when he was younger. Without another word, Junior and his crew leave Tony. Back at the doctor's office, Dr. Melfi tells Tony that she wants to focus more on his immediate family. Tony notes that Carmela and Meadow haven't been getting along lately. At the house, Father Intintola is watching a movie at the Soprano residence. Father Intintola is amazed at the laser discs and the DVD player. Carmela tells him that Tony watches The Godfather Part II and says it looks just like a movie theater. Carmela says that Tony prefers Part II over Part I because of the part when Vito returned to Sicily. Tony was very disappointed in Part III. Father Intintola asks Carmela where Tony ranks Goodfellas. Before she can answer, Carmela hears a pounding noise. Father Intintola asks if she has raccoons. Carmela says it sounds like someone is trying to break open the window. Father Intintola notes that she has security lights and wonders who is trying to break in. Carmela gets a machine gun out of the cabinet and runs outside. It turns out to be Meadow trying to climb back into the upstairs window. Meadow tells Carmela that she noticed the glass rattled every time she went into the laundry room. Meadow asks if they have window putty. Carmela isn't stupid and knows that Meadow snuck out. AJ comes outside and asks what's going on. Meadow knows that AJ locked her bedroom window and thinks it was only so she would get caught. Carmela remarks that normal people thought she was upstairs doing her homework. Carmela thinks that Meadow has become a master of lying and conniving. Meadow knows that she's grounded and yells that Patrick's swim meet is tomorrow and he needs her. Carmela tells her that she isn't grounded for sneaking out. She tells her that she isn't going to Aspen with Hunter. Tony insists that the issue will blow over eventually and the two will learn to get along again. Dr. Melfi asks if Tony admitted he was depressed to Dr. Cusamano. Tony hesitates and starts to look around. He notes that Dr. Melfi's last name is Italian and asks her where she's from. Dr. Melfi tells her that her father's ancestors are from Caserta. Tony notes his ancestors are from Avellino. Tony admits that Livia would have loved it if he and Dr. Melfi would have been married. Dr. Melfi changes the subject and tells him that anxiety attacks are legitimate psychiatric emergencies. She notes it would be dangerous if he was driving and passed out. Tony starts to get really frustrated. He tells Dr. Melfi that in today's world everyone has to go see shrinks and counselors and talk about their problems. Tony wonders what happened to Gary Cooper. He notes that Gary Cooper was a tough, silent American and that's the way Americans should be. Tony doesn't think Gary Cooper was in touch with his feelings and he did what he had to do to live on. Tony thinks that people didn't realize that once Gary Cooper was in touch with his feelings that they wouldn't be able to shut him up. After that, all the world is about is dysfunction. Dr. Melfi remarks that Tony has soft feelings about this topic. Tony tells her that he had a year and a half at college where he learned about Freud and therapy being a concept. Tony insists that in his world it does not go down. Tony admits he could be happier, but there isn't a person out there who couldn't be. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he feels depressed. Tony stays silent for a few moments, but states that when the ducks left he has felt depressed. Dr. Melfi notes that these were the ducks that preceded him fainting. Dr. Melfi wants to talk about the ducks. Tony has had it and storms outside. At night, Pussy and Christopher hide Kolar's body. Pussy adds that Christopher can't blame Tony for being mad because Christopher shouldn't have killed Kolar yet. Christopher tells Pussy that he won't show initiative ever again. Christopher notes that Tony is running down the business and he killed Kolar to keep one of their stops. Pussy retorts that Tony isn't running the business down and it's New York that's causing the problems. Pussy notes that this is a messed up situation. Pussy knows that the uncle isn't going to cave in and give the business to them if he finds out that Kolar was murdered. Christopher quotes from The Godfather and says that Louis Brassi sleeps with the fishes. Pussy corrects Christopher and says the guy's name was Luca Brassi. Christopher doesn't care, but Pussy says that there is a big difference between Luca Brassi being killed and Kolar being killed. Pussy tells Christopher that if the Kolars know that Emil is dead then it hardens their position in the company. On top of that, the cops are going to try and find out who killed him. Christopher asks Pussy what he wants them to do. Pussy suggests that Kolar just disappears and never comes home. Pussy says this way, they know he's dead, but they really don't know for sure. The Kolars will always hope that Emil comes home. Christopher likes the idea and Pussy says they'll cut him up on Staten Island. Christopher asks Pussy what he would do if Tony ended up disabled, indicating him fainting at the birthday party. Pussy doesn't have an answer and scolds Christopher for questioning that. The next day, Tony, Carmela, Livia, Meadow, and AJ visit Green Groves Retirement Home. As they are getting a tour, Carmela notices material by Zora Neale Hurston. She notes that Meadow just read a book by her in school. Meadow is still angry with Carmela and storms away from her. Tony thinks Green Groves is very nice. AJ agrees and tells Livia that she really should think about coming to live here. The tour guide takes the family to the living room which was just renovated last year. Livia sees a set of doors with several doctors and rooms. Livia asks the tour guide what happens behind those doors. The tour guide says that those doors are to the nursing unit. Livia notes that this is a nursing home, not a retirement community. The tour guide insists that this is a retirement community and the nursing unit is just in case of an emergency. Livia isn't buying it and screams that she is not living in a nursing home. Tony tells Livia to listen to what the tour guide is saying. Livia refuses to listen and reminds them about the babbling old ladies. Livia scolds the tour guide and notes that she thinks that the tour guide is high and mighty with her fancy office. Livia screams that people come here to die. Tony once again starts to feel stressed. He grabs onto a table, but it won't hold his weight. He has another panic attack and knocks the table and the vase down with him. Livia yells for someone to get a doctor. Tony is back in Dr. Melfi's office. He holds his face in his hands in embarrassment. Dr. Melfi notes that Tony only came back for help and assures him not to look at it as a defeat. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Livia was one of the children that grew up in the Great Depression, but the Depression to Livia was like a trip to Six Flags. Dr. Melfi notes that depression has popped up in his conversation again. Dr. Melfi tells Tony to stay on track with his mother. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that now that John is dead, he is a saint to Livia. But when John was alive, he was nothing to Livia. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that John was tough and ran his own crew. Tony blames Livia for wearing John down to a little nub. Tony thinks he was a squeaking gerbil when he died. Dr. Melfi notes that Livia is a very formidable maternal presence. Tony admits he also isn't getting any satisfaction from work. Dr. Melfi asks why. Tony says it's because of RICO. Dr. Melfi thinks Rico is Tony's brother, but Tony tells her that he meant the RICO statutes in the newspapers. Tony says that the government is using electronic surveillance and various legal strategies to take down his business. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he has any qualms about how he makes his living. Tony says he does. He says that he has to be the sad clown laughing on the inside, crying on the inside. Tony admits that things are on the downward trend. Tony says that before when someone got caught they would take their prison sentence with pride and everyone upheld the code of silence. He notes that nowadays nobody has time for the penal experience and there are no values. As a result of this, everyone turns into a government witness. Tony admits he feels exhausted talking about this. Dr. Melfi assures Tony that with the pharmacology of today, nobody needs to suffer with feelings of depression and exhaustion. Dr. Melfi writes him a prescription for Prozac. Tony isn't too thrilled. Later, Christopher meets with Hesh Rabkin at the Bada Bing Strip Club. Hesh informs Christopher that Mahaffey doesn't have the money. Christopher doesn't understand how Mahaffey couldn't have the money. Hesh simply says that Mahaffey just doesn't have it. Christopher notes that they ran Mahaffey over with a car. Hesh insists that Mahaffey has no wiggle room and is broke. Tony joins the two. Hesh tells Tony that he heard that Junior wants to whack Pussy. Tony corrects Hesh and says that it's Little Pussy Malanga that Junior wants to kill. Tony insists that Junior would never mess with Big Pussy. Silvio joins the group and asks for some drinks from a waitress. Hesh asks Tony if Junior resents Tony being boss. Hesh notes that Junior has had his eye on the boss position his whole life. Hesh recounts that John and his younger brother were made men even before Junior was. Hesh can understand why Junior doesn't like Tony telling him what to do. Tony tells Hesh that he loves Junior. Hesh notes that Junior is driven by his insecurities. Silvio adds he feels bad about being the messenger and leaves the group. Hesh advises Tony to get Artie out of town so the restaurant closes for a few weeks. This would force Junior to have to do the hit in another location. Tony is impressed with Hesh's thinking and notes that he knew there was a reason John kept him around all this time. Hesh asks about Mahaffey's money. Tony notes that Mahaffey's new business partner is Hesh. Tony notes that HMOs pay millions to doctors and patients. Tony notes that it cost $2,000 for his MRI. Tony says that they give Mahaffey a choice. He says that the company can either start paying phony claims to fake clinics that they will set up or he pays Hesh the $250,000 that he owes him which Mahaffey can't do. Hesh thinks this could be a major step. Tony thinks it's better than garbage. Christopher notes that garbage is their bread and butter. Tony insists that it was their bread and butter. At the Soprano residence, Carmela gets out some money in a can that she's been keeping. She runs upstairs to see Meadow, who is lying down on her bed. Meadow tells Carmela that she isn't going with her downtown. Carmela notes that every year since Meadow was younger on this day they would go get a makeover and have tea under Eloise's portrait in the New York Plaza Hotel. Meadow insists that she has too much homework. Carmela insists that it's their tradition and they always have fun. Meadow tells Carmela that she hasn't had fun doing that since she was eight. She says that she went because Carmela like going. Carmela admits she thought that they wouldn't be like this until long after she was married with daughters of her own. Meadow hopes she doesn't live around this area by then. Carmela tells Meadow that she can't just lie, cheat, and break rules that she doesn't like. Meadow gives Carmela a look. Carmela asks Meadow if she has something she wants to say. Meadow asks Carmela if she knows how much it means to go skiing in Aspen. Meadow notes that won't happen every year like tea and scones at the Plaza Hotel. Carmela tells Meadow she'll see her later. Meadow asks Carmela to close the door on her way out. At Vesuvio, Tony and Christopher visit Artie. Tony asks Artie if he can help him out. Artie asks what he needs. Tony tells Artie about a Caribbean Cruise for three weeks. He tells Artie that he has a pair of tickets, but he can't use them. Tony wants Artie to take them off his hands and go on the cruise with Charmaine. Christopher says they are from Comps. Artie asks what Comps is. Tony says that as a manager for the Kitchen and Restaurant Workers Union, he administered the dental plan. Tony says that some of the dentists got together and awarded him the tickets for all of his hard work. Tony insists he can't take off for these dates. Tony asks Artie when his last vacation was. Artie thanks Tony for the cruise tickets. At the office, Dr. Melfi comes out to the waiting room to bring Tony in for his next appointment. However, she finds that the waiting room is empty. She goes back into her office. Back at the Bucco residence, Charmaine is very angry that Artie accepted the cruise tickets from Tony and says that he can't accept a gift from a man like Tony. Artie says that if he has to work another day without a break he's going to lose his mind. Charmaine tells Artie that this isn't up for discussion. Charmaine tells the children it's time to go home. Artie insists that he and her have to get away for the marriage. Charmaine insists that it's bad enough that the Mafia has to eat at Vesuvio. Artie insists that they aren't connected. Charmaine says that is correct because they are turning down the tickets. Artie insists that the tickets are just Comps and Tony is a labor leader. Charmaine tells Artie to wake up and asks him if it makes any sense that a union of dentists would decide to give out a cruise to a labor union leader. Charmaine insists that someone had to bust a kneecap to get those tickets. Later, Hesh and Pussy meet with Mahaffey. Mahaffey is on crutches due to his broken leg. Mahaffey insists that he can't fraud the HMO company for Tony. Pussy insists that the paperwork will look real. Mahaffey asks how he won't get caught. Hesh tells Mahaffey to stop knocking himself and adds that he's a smart man. Mahaffey states that he is so depressed he can't eat or sleep. Hesh asks if he's on Prozac. Mahaffey states he's on Zoloft, which is similar. He adds Zoloft is supposed to help with the gambling. Pussy doubts that, but Mahaffey says that the medicine of today is supposed to suppress compulsive behaviors. Pussy says it's a shame that a medication comes along after his gambling caused a problem. Mahaffey insists he's not trying to be cynical. Hesh states that his debt and the feelings surrounding it is the source of all of his problems. Mahaffey states that he's sorry he hasn't paid Hesh yet. He adds he never meant to disgrace Tony's name. Hesh knows Mahaffey didn't do it intentionally. Hesh asks if he wants to go walk on the rocks. Mahaffey notes that with his new crutches, he can't. Hesh tells Mahaffey that they'll help him and adds that he goes out to the rocks to think. Pussy throws his ice cream cone over the bridge down to the water and rocks below. Mahaffey gets the message and tells them that he will go along with their plan for setting up MRIs as payment from HMOs. The next day, Tony is playing a round of golf. He takes out his Prozac and takes a pill. He quickly puts it away before another crew member, Paulie Walnuts Gualtieri, tells Tony that Barone is looking for him. Barone arrives with some good news. He tells Tony that Triborough Towers called and that the Kolar brothers withdrew their bid. Tony is glad to hear that. Barone notes that Artie is also here to see him. Barone takes off to continue business. Tony meets with Artie at the garbage dump. Tony asks Artie if everything is alright. Artie pulls out the cruise tickets and gives them back to Tony. Tony notes that they discussed this and Artie has to go on a vacation. Artie apologizes, but says he can't go. Later that night, Dr. Melfi is on a date with a man named Nils. Nils argues with the waiters and notes he made a reservation two weeks ago. The person at the desk apologizes, but states that people aren't leaving and there are five parties ahead of him. Nils gives up and goes back to Dr. Melfi. Dr. Melfi suggests that they find a new restaurant to eat at. Behind them, Tony and a date, Irina Peltsin, arrive at the restaurant. Tony sees Dr. Melfi and greets her. Tony asks Dr. Melfi if she comes here often. Dr. Melfi says she does. Tony play Dr. Melfi off like a decorator and tells her that the decorating tips really worked. Dr. Melfi is glad to hear that. Tony introduces himself to Nils. When Tony leaves, Nils asks Dr. Melfi if she knows who that was. He knows that Tony is a patient of Dr. Melfi's. Dr. Melfi insists that she can't say whether he is or not. Tony calls over Christopher's girlfriend, Adriana La Cerva, and tells her to get a table ready for Nils and Dr. Melfi. Adriana walks over to them and tells them that there is a table ready for them. Nils is amazed. Later that night, Tony takes Irina to his boat, The Stugots. Irina asks Tony who the woman was he saw tonight. Tony insists it was only his decorator. Irina asks if Tony is remodeling the garbage dump. Tony laughs and notes that was a funny joke. Irina puts on the sailor's hat and Tony chases after a naked Irina. He warns her that the hat was worn by JFK and he bought it at an auction. Irina tells Tony that she knows there is something more intimate between him and Dr. Melfi. Tony assures her that they only talk. Tony kisses Irina. The next night, Tony takes Carmela out to dinner. Tony tells Carmela that there are times when life is good. Carmela says that life is often good. She notes that Tony has been in good spirits for the last few days. Tony tells Carmela that he has to confess something to her. Carmela moves her glass and notes that she is readying herself to throw it in Tony's face. Tony notes she's always so dramatic. Carmela tells Tony to confess what he has to tell her. Tony tells her that he's on Prozac. He tells her that he's seeing a therapist. Carmela is actually thrilled to hear that from Tony. She notes that it is a very gutsy move for him and adds that psychology doesn't address the soul. She thinks this is a big start. Tony tells her that she is the only one that knows and she's only getting to know because she's his wife. He adds that she is the only person that he is truly honest with. Carmela doesn't believe that. Tony says that this is serious and notes that if the wrong person finds out it could get him killed. Carmela tells Tony that she never realized how unhappy he was. Tony adds that Livia contributes to his stress. Carmela asks Tony if he told the psychiatrist about his father, noting that she thinks the psychologist is a male. Tony doesn't tell Carmela that Dr. Melfi is a female and tells her that he has talked about John. Tony states that lately he has felt that his life was out of balance. Carmela tells Tony that their existence on the Earth is a puzzle. She notes that Meadow hates her. Tony tells her that this is what mothers and daughters will do, and promises Carmela that Meadow will forgive her. At home, Meadow answers the telephone. Christopher is on the other line and asks Meadow if she has no social life. Meadow tells him off and that's when Tony and Carmela arrive home. Meadow hands the phone to Tony. Carmela brings in some primavera for Meadow to eat. Meadow still ignores her and heads upstairs. Christopher is watching the television and informs Tony that Little Pussy Malanga has returned from Florida. Christopher realizes that the hit is going to happen soon. Tony tells him not to worry about it and says he has a way to prevent the hit from going down at Vesuvio. The next day, Meadow is playing volleyball at the school. Tony and Silvio watch her from the stands. Silvio notes that Tony needs something and asks when he needs it by. Tony tells Silvio that he needs this thing right away. Silvio tells Tony that he can get a party together for him. They notice a bad call on the ball going out of bounds and Tony and Silvio yell at the referee. After the volleyball game, Meadow finds Tony outside. She notes that Carmela didn't come to the game. Tony states that Carmela didn't think that she would want her to watch the game. Tony tells Meadow that she played a good game today. The two say goodbye to Silvio and his daughter, Heather. Tony wonders where Heather learned the spike move from. Meadow breaks the ice and asks Tony if he thinks Carmela is being unreasonable about stopping her trip to Aspen. She thinks it's even worse that Carmela is playing the sad mother trying to make her feel bad. Tony looks up at the church and has his eye on something. He walks inside. Meadow follows him still complaining that Carmela is being unfair. Tony sits down in one of the pews and notes that it's been years since he went into a church. Meadow begs Tony to talk to Carmela about letting her go to Aspen, but Tony isn't listening. Meadow asks why they are sitting here. Tony tells her that Carmela thinks that Meadow has the ability to be the top student in her class. Tony adds that he agrees. Meadow asks if they're really looking for perfection. Tony doesn't answer, and Meadow wants to know what he's looking at. Tony tells Meadow that her great-grandfather and great-uncle built this church. Meadow isn't impressed. Tony continues to tell her that they were stone and marble works that came from Italy and built the church. Meadow doesn't believe that only the two of them made it. Tony adds that they had a group of workers, and despite not designing the church, they still knew how to build it. Tony states that it's practically impossible to find two good plumbers nowadays. Downtown, Silvio walks by Vesuvio. After he crosses the street, a huge explosion occurs and Vesuvio catches on fire. The next day, Tony meets with Dr. Melfi. He informs her that he is feeling good and doesn't know if he needs to come back to visit her again. Dr. Melfi says that it isn't the Prozac that's doing that to him. She states that he said he was thinking clearer and Carmela added that he seemed better overall. Dr. Melfi adds that it takes weeks for Prozac to build effective levels in the blood. Tony asks what is making him better. Dr. Melfi says that it's the talks that make him feel better. She adds that hope comes in many forms. Tony notes he doesn't have a lot of time to devote to therapy. Dr. Melfi asks Tony what he wants to say to her. Tony tells her that he had a dream last night. He says that in the dream his bellybutton was a Phillips head screw and he was unscrewing it in the dream. He says that when the screw came out, his penis fell off. Tony says that he picks it up and tries to find the man that used to work on his car so that he can put it back on. Tony says that when he holds it up a bird swooped down and grabbed it. Dr. Melfi asks what kind of bird it was. Tony says it might have been a seagull. He notes he watched the movie, The Birds, last week and wonders if that planted the idea. Dr. Melfi notes it was a water bird and notes Tony's ducks. Dr. Melfi asks Tony why the ducks meant so much to him. Tony says it was beautiful for the ducks to come into the pool and start a family. Tony admits he was sad to see them go. He starts to sob. Dr. Melfi passes him the tissues. Dr. Melfi notes that when the ducks had babies they became a family. Tony says that it's a link because he is afraid he is going to lose his family like he lost the ducks. Tony admits this is where the root of his problems lies. Dr. Melfi asks Tony what he thinks is going to happen. Tony admits he doesn't know. The next day, Tony, Paulie, Artie, Silvio, Pussy, and Christopher are standing around the grill while Tony cooks some hamburgers, hotdogs, and sausage. Artie is very upset that his restaurant burns down, but doesn't know that Tony had it burned down. He says that it is so tough to see his life's dream go up in flames. Tony notes that he's collecting insurance money from the damages. Paulie adds that it could have been a worse situation. Artie says that it was a faulty stove that caused the fire and that is bad in his eyes. Christopher tells Artie that people could have stopped coming to the restaurant and that would have been worse for him. Tony stares at Christopher for saying that. Christopher is fed up with everything and leaves the group. Tony admits that Christopher did have a point and there's no insurance for losing customers. Artie asks why people would even stop coming to the restaurant. Tony says that lately he's been figuring out that talking about things help. Everyone else agrees with Tony. Tony reiterates Dr. Melfi's words and states that hope comes in many forms. Artie starts to sob over the loss of his restaurant. Tony tells Artie that he will always help him and gives him a hug. Tony tells Artie to cook the burgers for him to feel better. Christopher is sitting on the porch. Tony approaches him and sits down. Tony promises Christopher that one day he will tell Artie the truth about why the restaurant burned down. Christopher doesn't say anything. Tony demands to know what is wrong. Christopher tells Tony that he could have at least thanked him for his hand in the Triborough Towers contract. Tony tells Christopher that he is right. However, he tells Christopher that when he was growing up, John and Livia never supported or complimented him for anything. Christopher tells Tony that he has a friend that knows someone in the movie industry that would give Christopher millions of dollars for his life story. Christopher notes he didn't do that and decided to stick it out with him. Tony grabs Christopher and asks him if he would really sell his story. Tony notes that there are several mobsters that are selling their screenplays and messing things up for all of them. Christopher adds that he might even be able to star as himself in the movie. Tony tells Christopher to forget about the Hollywood screenplays and the rest of those distractions. Tony notes he's even had offers. Tony tells him that they have work to do and everything will be alright from here on out. He takes Christopher back outside and says that they should enjoy their beautiful day. Junior picks up Livia to take her to AJ's birthday party. Livia thanks Junior for picking her up and adds that somebody at least cares about her. Livia thinks that Tony wants to put her in a nursing home so she'll die faster and then he won't have to deal with her anymore. Livia adds that if John were still alive he would show more decency and respect towards her. Junior remembers that John was a man with respect. Livia starts to sob and states that he was a saint. Junior also notes that things are different from John's days and theirs. Livia doesn't understand. Junior tells her that he isn't free to run his business the way he wants. Livia thinks that is hard for him. Junior notes that Tony interfered last week and made it even more difficult. He adds that Tony also doesn't have a lot of respect for New York. Junior states that Tony is part of an entire generation. He continues to berate Tony and Livia asks Junior to stop because he's making her upset. Junior admits he isn't trying to make her upset, but adds he is like this most of the time. Junior also states that this are down all across the board and a lot of his friends are complaining. Junior knows that they used to be recession proof, but that isn't the case anymore. Junior says that his friends are trying to get him to take a larger hand in the Mafia and mentions that something may have to be done about Tony. Junior and Livia arrive at the Soprano residence to see Tony cooking. Tony says hello, but Livia immediately complains, noting that he's using mesquite and it will make the sausage taste weird. Livia says happy birthday to A.J. Tony tells Carmela that Livia is finally here and Carmela tells everyone it's time to eat. The family all heads over to the food table to get some food. The episode ends with a long shot of Tony's pool."

The two sit in silence for several minutes and all the while Tony is checking out Dr. Melfi's body. Tony finally breaks the silence and asks Dr. Melfi if she's going to say anything. Dr. Melfi notes that Tony is the one that is paying the bill. Tony looks out the window and sees Hesh walk right past the office. Tony is startled and tells Dr. Melfi that he just saw his friend walk past the window. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that Hesh has a three o'clock appointment. Tony bursts out of the office and sees AJ standing on the other side of the door. Tony turns away and goes back into the waiting room. When he walks back into the waiting room, he finds Silvio having sex with a woman on one of the waiting chairs and Paulie and Pussy reading newspapers. He then turns back to the office to see that Dr. Melfi is turned around facing away from him. Tony asks Dr. Melfi what is going on. Dr. Melfi replies, in a man's voice, that thunderstorms are coming. Tony turns to see Aprile lying down on his hospital bed smoking a cigarette. He tells Tony that he smells rain coming. Tony asks Dr. Melfi what she is doing to him. When Dr. Melfi turns around, she suddenly has the face of Livia. Tony falls backwards in a panic attack. An alarm is ringing in the background and we can tell that Tony was only dreaming. He is in a motel room with his mistress, Irina. Irina asks Tony if everything is alright. Tony tells Irina to go back to sleep. He puts on his clothes and leaves. At the Soprano residence, AJ is busy playing Mario Kart in the living room. Tony comes in and notes that AJ has school tomorrow. AJ states that he is working on getting the high score. He asks Tony where he's been. Tony lies and tells him that the compactor at Barone Sanitation failed. Tony sits down and decides to play a race with AJ. As they play, Tony asks AJ how things are going for him. AJ isn't paying attention and is too busy focusing on the game. AJ finally tells Tony that he needs to concentrate in order to play and sets up a new game. Tony covers AJ's eyes in a joke and is able to pull ahead in the race. Tony is able to finish ahead of AJ in the game. Tony tells AJ to learn the lesson of focusing through distractions and tells him to be in bed in ten minutes. The next day, Christopher and Adriana leave the hospital. Christopher has a neck brace on his neck and several cuts and bruises from the men last night that acted out a fake hit. Christopher is looking around in fright and asks Adriana where she parked. Adriana assures Christopher that nobody followed her, but Christopher knows that Adriana wouldn't be smart enough to know if someone had or not. Adriana tells Christopher to stop being paranoid and assures him that nobody is here. Christopher isn't calming down and tells Adriana to go get the car. Adriana starts to mock Christopher and starts to point out places where Tony is probably lying in wait. Christopher is angry and pulls Adriana back into the hospital. Christopher notes that anyone could pop out and shoot him at any time and notes that Tony might not be the one after him. Adriana reminds Christopher that he gave speed to Adriana. Christopher doesn't think that Tony found out about that. Adriana can only complain about her wrist. Christopher is angry with her selfishness and notes that he was dragged out to the Meadowlands and was mock executed. Adriana stares at him and Christopher asks what she wants to say. Adriana hesitates, but tells Christopher that the nurse told her that he messed his pants. Christopher tells Adriana to stop messing around and orders her to go get the car so they can go talk to Filone. Christopher and Adriana arrive at Filone's house. They knock on the door, but Filone doesn't answer. Christopher and Adriana let themselves in. Adriana says she needs to use the restroom and heads straight for the bathroom. Adriana walks in and screams at the sight of Filone's dead body in the bathtub. Christopher joins her and sees that Filone was shot right through the eye. Christopher and Adriana hold each other as they grieve. At school, AJ makes a phone call to someone else and tells him to deliver a message to a boy in his school. He looks across the hall to see the boy pick up his phone, realizing that AJ made a prank call. The boy, Jeremy Piocosta, confronts AJ and asks if he thinks he's funny. AJ doesn't understand what Jeremy is talking about. Jeremy tells AJ that if he prank calls him again he is going to be sorry. AJ again denies that he did anything. Jeremy notes that he's heard all of the mother jokes before, and then teases AJ by asking him why he ate all of the donuts his mother sent to them at camp. Jeremy remembers that AJ would cry on his mother's shoulder saying that he was homesick. AJ shoves him and tells him to shut up. Jeremy shoves him back and the boys start to fight. Jeremy is taller than AJ and shoves him into the lockers. The two slug each other and Jeremy rips the collar on AJ's shirt. A teacher comes to the scene and tells the boys to stop fighting. At the doctor's office, Tony is walking down the hall when he spots Silvio in the hallway leaving his dentist's office. Tony quickly ducks into another room to avoid being seen. When Silvio leaves, Tony walks over to the office and notes that Silvio was only seeing the dentist. He arrives at Dr. Melfi's office and goes inside. At their appointment, Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he is having second thoughts about therapy. Tony explains that it's only about security and notes that he doesn't know how safe it is to tell her things about his life. Dr. Melfi says that she understands his concerns, but notes that they already went over the ground rules that involved confidentiality for anything that wasn't incriminating. Tony tells her that the fact he is in therapy incriminates him. Tony worries that one of his crew will see him here and then they will tell everyone else in the Mafia about it. Dr. Melfi changes the subject and states that she was under the impression that they were working on his narcissism. Tony asks Dr. Melfi who she thinks she is. Dr. Melfi asks Tony why it's important for him to know. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that one of the things Livia taught him was to never answer a question with another question. Dr. Melfi is glad to hear that Livia taught him something. Tony asks Dr. Melfi who she trusts in life and what she talks about. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that she's going to take the Fifth Amendment on that question. At school, Meadow and Hunter are standing outside waiting for the bus. Adriana approaches them and informs them that Christopher needs to see them. Meadow wonders what is going on and she thinks it has something to do with Tony. Meadow wonders if the FBI is serving another warrant on their home. Christopher jumps out and yells at Meadow for telling Tony about the speed. Meadow sees Christopher beaten up and asks him what happened. Christopher yells that he and Adriana are probably going to have to move to Florida because of Meadow telling Tony. Hunter is only concerned about Filone getting her love poem. Adriana starts to drive the car and Meadow promises Christopher that she never told Tony about the speed. Christopher tells Meadow this is serious and Meadow tells Christopher to let go of her and to stop yelling. Meadow starts to cry and tells Christopher that Tony has been worried about him and asking everyone where he's been. Christopher apologizes to Meadow for acting this way. Meadow states that she hates her life because she's a Soprano. Christopher warns Meadow to never say that because it's blasphemy. Meadow isn't really concerned about that. Christopher tells Adriana to drive and tells Meadow that they'll buy her a Happy Meal at McDonalds. At the Soprano residence, AJ is trying to kill a fly in his room with a baseball glove. Carmela comes in with the ripped shirt and asks AJ why it was in the trashcan. AJ just plays it off as the shirt going out of style. Carmela isn't buying the excuse for one second and AJ admits to Carmela that he was in a fight. Carmela asks who it was. AJ tells Carmela that it was Jeremy Piocosta, but notes to her that he didn't get any demerits. Carmela is shocked and remembers that he and Jeremy went to camp and she thought they were friends. AJ has nothing to say and Carmela tells AJ that she is going to call Mrs. Piocosta to see what she has to say. AJ doesn't want her to, but Carmela tells AJ that they need to learn the value of a dollar when it comes to the ruined shirt. AJ tells Carmela that he will wash her car to pay for the shirt. Carmela notes that he never puts effort into washing it. AJ promises to do well and he'll get the money for the shirt as long as she doesn't call Jeremy's mother. Carmela tells AJ that the shirt is $40. Tony visits Livia at the retirement home. Tony tells Livia that he brought her some macaroons for her to snack on. Livia isn't thrilled and tells Tony that macaroons are too sweet. Tony thought that they were Livia's favorite. Tony informs Livia that Rosie, the activities director, is organizing a trip to the city. Livia doesn't want to go and tells him that she doesn't like the people here or the city. Tony notes that Livia hasn't gotten to know the people well at all and that's her own fault. Livia complains that in the city, there are mothers throwing their babies out of windows, grown men messing their pants, and thieves. Tony notes that Livia always thinks this way. He notes that he hasn't seen her try to interact with the other people that live in the retirement home. Livia asks why he even cares about that and thinks that Tony's philosophy of her is that if she's out of sight, she's out of mind. Tony says that he doesn't think like that at all. Livia again asks God to take her out of the world. Tony tells Livia that he came to see her to get cheered up and now he thinks that was a mistake. He tells Livia that she can't put all of her problems on him. He notes that he has put her in the most expensive retirement home in New Jersey and Livia could be happy here if she wanted to be. Livia isn't concerned at all. Tony asks Livia if she really wants the macaroons, but Livia tells Tony that she doesn't care. Tony gets up, grabs the macaroons, and leaves. Outside, Tony gets back into his car. He hears an older woman walking with one of the nurses saying that it might rain today. Tony then spots his informer from the police, Vin Makazian, taking a leak in the bushes near the home. Tony picks up a rock and throws it Makazian. Tony asks Makazian what he's doing. Makazian notes that the office is an hour away from here. Tony tells him to get over it and notes that Livia lives here now. Makazian complains that meeting him out at the retirement home wasn't very convenient for him. Tony notes that it's better than him going to the precinct to talk to him. Makazian asks Tony what he has for him. Tony hands Makazian a slip of paper with Dr. Melfi's name on it. Tony tells Makazian that he wants to know Dr. Melfi's background and routine. Makazian wants to know the state of relationship he has with Dr. Melfi, but Tony isn't telling him. Tony asks Makazian if he's bored with his life. Makazian says that lately all he's arrested are prostitutes and drug addicts. He also adds that it's hard for him to pay two alimonies when he only gets $40,000 each year. Tony cuts in and warns Makazian that he is not to touch or bother Dr. Melfi. Makazian asks if he'll get the usual wage for doing his job. Tony reminds Makazian that the Knicks lost last night so he is down $2,000. Makazian asks in exchange if they'll cut him a break. Tony says it depends on how good of a job he does. At the hospital, Tony, Silvio, Paulie, and Pussy sit with Aprile. Aprile is asleep and the men realize that his condition has turned for the worst. Christopher arrives at the hospital and Tony asks him where he's been. He notices that Christopher is beaten up and Christopher informs Tony that Filone has been murdered. Christopher tells Tony about Filone being shot while lying in his bathtub. Tony thinks that Junior had something to do with the hit. Christopher notes that Palmice is the one that does the hits for Junior and thinks that he murdered Filone. The men suddenly pay attention to Aprile who is in a hallucinating state. He says that he is at the World Trade Center. Christopher is agitated and pulls out a gun. Tony tells Christopher not to go looking for revenge because Palmice is a made man. Christopher is angry that Junior didn't take care of his problems on his own and sent Palmice and the Russians after him. Christopher takes off. Silvio stops Tony and tells him that their response needs to suit the message. Outside, Christopher tells Tony that Filone didn't deserve to die like that and tells Tony that he can't talk him out of killing Palmice. Tony tells Christopher that he cannot kill Palmice. Christopher reminds Tony that Junior is hounding him and they need to do something. Paulie steps out and tells Tony that he'll take care of Palmice since he knows where he lives. Tony tells them that he will handle it and warns Christopher to stay at the hospital. Tony walks over to the elevator and spots a maintenance man working on some things. Tony eyes a stapler sitting near him and while the man isn't looking, Tony takes it. Outside the restaurant, Palmice is sitting in his car. Tony appears and grabs him. Tony pulls Palmice out and starts to punch him repeatedly. Tony notes that after beating on him, Palmice's suit has been wrinkled. Tony offers to fix it and pulls out the staple gun that he stole. Tony staples the suit repeatedly to Palmice's skin. Palmice screams in pain and Tony hits him again. Tony tells Palmice that the beating was overdue. Tony walks into the restaurant to find Junior eating. Tony confronts Junior and asks him if they are going to stop taking shots at each other before the situation gets out of hand. Junior tells Tony that he could have said hello. Tony tells Junior that the only reason he is here right now is because he loves and respects him. Junior can see through this and tells Tony not to pretend that he's paying respect. He notes that is coming from a man that put his mother in a nursing home. Junior also notes that Christopher and Filone were interfering with his business and he couldn't just look the other way forever. Tony notes that the truck was returned. Junior reminds Tony that there was a previous warning made against the men not to interrupt the trucking business. Tony says that he runs his crew fine and Junior acted to the extreme. Junior tells Tony not to be a judge and notes that he answers to people that are higher up than Tony. Tony tells Junior that Aprile is on his deathbed and can't be bothered. Junior is aware that Christopher makes a lot of money for Tony's crew and says that he should work for him instead. Tony refuses to hand Christopher over to Junior. Junior notes that he showed him his hand and Tony just slapped it away. Tony asks Junior why they can't talk like adults anymore. Junior tells Tony to leave the restaurant. He warns him that the next time he comes here he needs to come heavy or not bother to come. Tony knows Junior doesn't mean that. Junior can't even look Tony straight in the face and Tony leaves. Later that night, Makazian is driving in his police car with his partner. He complains about how the pay scale was frozen by law by the time he got to take the sergeant exam. The other officer notes that they've been following the same couple for over an hour and all they did was eat a meal and watch a movie. Makazian tells his partner that a car that matches the same make and model of the car ahead of them was involved in a homicide. In the car, Dr. Melfi and her date, Randall Curtin, are driving home after the movie. Dr. Melfi tells Randall that her last boyfriend only lasted a week and notes that it's her fault that men don't know how to act. Randall knows that Dr. Melfi wants a man that is sensitive to her needs, but still has some decisiveness to him. Suddenly, the police lights are turned on and Makazian pulls Randall and Dr. Melfi over. Randall is confused and doesn't think he was going over the speed limit. Makazian walks up to the car and gets Randall's license and registration. Randall asks Makazian if he did something wrong. Makazian tells Randall that he crossed the yellow line and asks if he's been drinking. Randall says that they had wine with dinner. Makazian tells Randall to step out of the car. Randall is upset, but Dr. Melfi tells Randall to listen to Makazian. Makazian tells Randal to walk a straight line to him heel to toe. Randall tells Makazian he is being unnecessary and tells him that he's an attorney and knows that he's under the limit. Makazian orders Randall to open his trunk. Randall is baffled and tells Makazian that he isn't opening his trunk citing that Makazian has no probable cause to do that. Makazian mocks him and then notes that he's going to resist arrest. Makazian starts to punch Randall repeatedly and then kicks him when he's on the ground. Dr. Melfi gets out of the car and yells at the cops that what they are doing is illegal. Makazian states that he thought Randall had a weapon. Makazian tells his partner to arrest Randall on DUI, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer. The partner is scared of Makazian's behavior and arrests Randall. Dr. Melfi warns Makazian not to touch her. Makazian suggests to Dr. Melfi that she stay home next time and cook a prime rib. Dr. Melfi tells Randall that she's calling her lawyer and tells the police officers that they are in trouble. The next day, Makazian informs Tony that Dr. Melfi is seeing Randall Curtin, a tax lawyer. Makazian tells Tony that Dr. Melfi arrives at her office at 8 a.m. and leaves at 6 p.m. He adds that Dr. Melfi likes Diet Coke and a tuna sub. He also notes that Dr. Melfi has a three-bedroom condominium in Essex Falls and is divorced with a son. Makazian finally adds that Dr. Melfi sees a psychologist by the name of Elliot Kupferburg. Tony thanks Makazian for his help. Makazian tells Tony that he's willing to put $300 on the Rutgers game. Tony tells Makazian that gambling won't solve all of his problems and leaves. Later that night, Tony sits down with captain Larry Boy Barese and caporegimes Raymond Curto and Jimmy Altieri. They all have a laugh about Tony stapling the suit to Palmice earlier today. Curto doesn't feel sorry for Palmice and notes that he's been a problem for the Mafia since he was young. Barese notes that it won't make things easier for them to do business. Tony notes that Junior is a stubborn man and might heat things up for them. Altieri doesn't know if Junior is stubborn enough to go to war with the rest of the bosses. Barese notes that there hasn't been a war in the Mafia since the Columbo incident. Curto states that it would be a bad idea for anyone in the Mafia to go to war in this day and age. Tony blames all of this on Aprile being sick from his cancer. He thinks all of this would have been prevented if Aprile would have stayed healthy. Tony tells everyone that someone needs to step in for Aprile and take control because without a leader everyone can get away with things. The rest of the men agree with his reasoning. Tony tells Curto that if his father was here he would have been telling him to step in and take the position. Curto notes to Tony that he is the one that should take the spot because that's what his father and Aprile would have wanted. Tony notes that he's still young, but Curto has the age and seniority to step in. Curto adds he has his own problems with a son at home with multiple sclerosis. Tony thinks that Curto is just afraid of the FBI tapping his house with wires. Curto notes that Tony is the smart one in this family and that is why he should be the boss. Altieri agrees with Curto's reasoning. Barese suggests that they all run the Mafia in a council hierarchy. Altieri disagrees and notes that the founders set it up paramilitary style for a reason and states that they need one leader. Curto tells Tony that in the end, he and Junior are going to have to butt heads in the end. Tony says that would be bad because he loves Junior and he also notes that Junior has the New York associates on his side. Barese disagrees with Junior's style and notes that even New York is aware that Junior is controlling from the wrong century. Altieri tells Tony that one day he'll be able to get the position if he really wants it. Curto adds that it's inevitable that Tony will take over. Tony argues that he doesn't want any more disturbances in his life. At school, AJ gets a candy bar out of the vending machine. As he walks down the hall, Jeremy bumps into him. AJ asks what he wants and asks if he told his mother about the fight. Jeremy states that he didn't. AJ tells Jeremy that he owes him $40 for the shirt that he ripped yesterday. Jeremy notes that AJ still owes him money from the Fourth of July. AJ argues that he paid for the bottle rockets. Jeremy says that he was referring to the M-80s that they blew up frogs with. AJ remembers now and notes that it was a cool day. Jeremy lightens up and agrees. AJ gets serious and tells Jeremy that he needs the $40. Jeremy tells AJ he isn't giving it to him and adds that he probably did him a favor since the shirt was stupid looking. AJ tells Jeremy that he is going to give him the money. Jeremy dares him to make him hand it over. AJ hits Jeremy in the back of his head and Jeremy turns around and punches AJ in the nose. The two start to fight again, but their friends pull them apart. The two still want to go at it and the students state that it was a draw since nobody won the fight. Jeremy dares AJ to a fight in the Pit tomorrow after school. At a gardening shop, Tony tries to buy something to save his garden from the bugs. The clerk tries to give him environmentally friendly chemicals, but Tony wants DDT. The clerk notes that it's illegal and tells him that he can't help him. Tony then spots George Piocosta, the father of Jeremy, looking at some plants. Tony greets him and asks him how he's doing. George doesn't look too thrilled to see Tony. Tony remembers that their sons went to Camp Aheka last summer. George is reluctant to say anything, but he tells Tony he does remember. George asks Tony how AJ has been. Tony tells George that AJ is like any kid his age. George sees that Tony has bought an axe from the shop and he is starting to get nervous about what Tony might do with it. George tells Tony that he has to go. Tony suggests that they get together in a few weeks so the boys can hang out. George tells Tony that he doesn't think that Jeremy and AJ are close anymore. Tony tells George that he'll have Carmela call Linda and they'll arrange it. George tells him he'll see him later and then hurries away before Tony says anything else. Tony arrives home and starts to put the groceries away. Tony is starting to breathe very heavily and he suddenly has another panic attack. He passes out onto the floor. Carmela runs downstairs and asks Tony if he's alright. Tony is still conscious and Carmela helps him up. Carmela thought that the medicine was supposed to help his panic attacks. Tony says that it does and notes it's his first one since he started taking the medicine. Carmela suggests that he consults the therapist. Tony tells Carmela that he'll talk about it at his next session. Carmela asks Tony if the therapist has ever asked questions about their marriage. Tony says that all they ever do is talk about everything in his life. Tony tells Carmela that he wants to quit going to therapy. Carmela asks Tony if he talked to the therapist about that. Tony admits that he has. Tony realizes the reason he probably had one was because he didn't take his Prozac and asks Carmela to get it for him. Carmela stays with him for a minute and tells him that she knows that Aprile's cancer has caused a lot of stress. However, she feels that the therapy is helping him. Tony says that he doesn't understand how it is. Carmela says that is the reason he is in therapy because she doesn't understand. Carmela admits to Tony that if he gives up therapy she might reevaluate their marriage. Tony is frustrated and reminds Carmela that he has a very stressful job. Carmela asks if it's more important to have his marriage than anything else. Tony argues that therapy is exposing him to a lot more than he can handle. Carmela tells Tony that if he quits, he is going to have to live with the results. Tony asks Carmela if she's threatening him. Carmela hints that she is and tells Tony to go upstairs himself and get the Prozac. Tony goes to therapy the next day and tells Dr. Melfi about the panic attack. Dr. Melfi asks how long it lasted for and Tony states that it only lasted for thirty seconds and he never lost consciousness. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that she'll give him a prescription for Xanax that will hopefully help him get over the short term stresses in his life. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Junior is stressing him out and he might have to do things that he doesn't want to do. He adds that Livia is also treating him badly since he put her in the retirement home. Dr. Melfi thinks that Livia and Junior are playing with him. She notes that there's a book called Strategies for Coping with Elder Family. Tony doesn't think that any book in the world will describe Livia or Junior perfectly. Dr. Melfi notes that it wouldn't hurt for Tony to let Livia believe that she is still in charge. She says that it's the same with treating a child and notes that children like to believe that they are in control. Downtown, Christopher meets with Yo-Yo Mendez. Mendez is glad to see Christopher and notes that he heard about the trip to the Meadowlands that Christopher went on. Christopher asks Mendez for his cut. Mendez informs Christopher that Junior's men came and took it from him. Mendez adds that Junior is now claiming this block is in his territory. Christopher can't believe Mendez just gave them the money. Mendez argues that they were pointing a gun at him. Christopher asks why he didn't call him. Mendez informs Christopher that the word on the street is that he is out of commission. Christopher tells Mendez that he understands, but then kicks Mendez in the stomach. Christopher then takes Mendez's yo-yo and wraps the string around his throat. Christopher tells Mendez that he doesn't care what Junior's boys do to him and tells him that it's still his corner. He warns Mendez that if he ever pays anyone else on the street again, he will come back and cut off his thumbs. Christopher takes the money that Mendez has on him at the time and leaves him beaten and bruised. At the Pit, AJ arrives to get ready for the fight. The crowd is gathered and they see Jeremy coming. AJ gets ready, but Jeremy isn't coming for a fight. Jeremy hands AJ the $40 that he owed him for the shirt. AJ tells Jeremy that he's willing to fight him for it, but Jeremy tells AJ that he can't fight him. AJ asks what he means by that, but Jeremy doesn't have an answer. AJ finally takes the money and tells Jeremy that he knew he would back out. AJ is momentarily triumphant and says that Jeremy is definitely scared of him. One of the boys in the crowd tells AJ that Jeremy isn't afraid of him at all. AJ asks what he means. Nobody in the crowd supports AJ and they leave to go home. It is clear that George told Jeremy not to fight AJ out of fear of Tony. At the Bada Bing, Tony is reading the book that Dr. Melfi recommended. He takes a Xanax to calm his nerves. Tony looks up at the news on the television and sees something that devastates him. The newscaster reports that Aprile died of his cancer at St. Isaac's Hospital. Tony yells for the music to be turned off. The newscaster reports that Aprile was seen as the acting boss for Eckley DiMeo who is serving a life sentence in Springfield Penitentiary. Aprile was made acting boss two years earlier for the North Jersey Mafia. Tony breaks down and starts to cry. He states that he saw Aprile earlier in the day and Aprile swore to him he wouldn't die today. Pussy, Paulie, and Silvio mourn with Tony over Aprile's death. The men get drinks poured and Tony toasts to Aprile's memory. Christopher comes in and states that he heard about Aprile's death. He also informs Tony about the situation on his block from Mendez. Paulie tells Christopher that now isn't the time to deal with business. Christopher argues that Junior is taking this opportunity to move in and they need to stop him. Tony tells Christopher that they need to assess this. Christopher argues that they aren't politicians and further states that this is about respect. Tony again tells Christopher that none of this concerns him. Christopher argues that he represents Tony and he's tired of feeling defeated. Christopher says that this isn't the time for negotiation and states that it's time to go to war. He furthermore states that if Tony does nothing he is going to question his leadership. Tony grabs Christopher and throws him onto the pool table. He warns him to never question his leadership ever again. Christopher insists that he is just saying things like they appear, but relents and tells Tony he still recognizes him as boss. Tony lets go of Christopher and tells him the only reason he didn't go harder on him today was because of Aprile's death. Pussy comments that this will go in the history books as the War of '99 for the Mafia. Tony leaves and Christopher tells the others that they need to go with Tony. Paulie warns Christopher that he needs to listen to what he's told. Tony arrives at the restaurant. He loads a gun and puts it in his pants. He walks inside and tells Junior that he needs to talk to him. Tony admits to Junior that he does have a gun, but he doesn't want to use it. Junior allows Tony to sit down. The two sit in silence for a moment before Tony tells Junior that Aprile died. Junior states that he heard. Tony also notes that they are going to need a leader and tells Junior he doesn't want any confusion or misunderstanding about what he is going to say. Tony notes that the Sopranos have been waiting for some time to step up. Tony then asks Junior if he wants the position and is willing to let him have the leadership in the Mafia. Junior asks if it really is his decision. Tony says it is and adds he can clear it with his captains. Junior and Tony hug and Junior admits he was worried about how the situation would transpire. Tony tells Junior that nobody can believe that he has lost face and asks Junior for Bloomfield and Paving Union to be transferred to his territory. Junior agrees to this and Tony congratulates him. Back at the house, AJ tells Meadow about how he almost got into a fight at school with Jeremy. Meadow asks who won the fight. AJ tells Meadow about Jeremy backing out of the fight. He then mentions about the boy that told him that Jeremy wasn't afraid of him and admits that he doesn't know what he meant. Meadow tells AJ that he can be naïve at times and asks him if he knows what Tony does for a living. AJ says that Tony works with waste management. Meadow asks him if he knows any other garbage men that live in luxury. AJ says Junior also works in the business. Meadow notes that Junior is part of Tony's other family. Meadow sees AJ isn't getting the point and pulls up a website all about the Mafia. She prints out the page about the Mafia and Tony. Later, Dr. Melfi goes to Randall's house to see how he's doing. Dr. Melfi is glad to see that Randall is alright and notes that she tried to call him. Randall informs her that his phone isn't hooked in. Randall tells Dr Melfi that he's worried and he thinks he is losing his mind. He tells her that he was standing in line at the doughnut shop this morning and when the cashier looked at him, he started to shake uncontrollably. He then ran away from the shop. Dr. Melfi tells Randall that he's been through a traumatic experience. Randall admits to her that he is afraid of going outside because he thinks someone is following him. Dr. Melfi tells Randall that she can set him up with one of her friends that deals with post-traumatic stress disorder. Randall asks Dr. Melfi if she can prescribe something to him. Dr. Melfi reminds Randall that she is only his date and not his doctor. Randall understands and apologizes. Back at the Soprano residence, AJ reads over the information that Meadow gave to him. He lies down in bed and looks at a picture of his father and him when they went fishing. As he stares at the photo, he wonders who his father really is. The next day at therapy, Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he saw his first dead body when he was only fifteen. He says that it was a man that was murdered by someone. Dr. Melfi isn't totally focused and she admits she wasn't listening to Tony. She tells Tony that she was thinking that she lived in a sheltered existence. Tony asks what she means. Dr. Melfi says she's inside of her office for ten hours each day and she thinks that she is out of touch with the rage that exists in American society. Dr. Melfi tells Tony about Randall being beat up by a police officer. Tony realizes that it was Makazian that beat up Randall. Dr. Melfi states that it was a nightmare for him and for her. She admits she didn't know if the cop was drunk or crazy, but he told her not to go out for prime rib. Tony thinks that the cop was an idiot. Dr. Melfi says that Randall is filing a lawsuit with the city. She says that the worst part about this is that Randall will never be the same again. Tony apologizes to her for that. Dr. Melfi states that it isn't Tony's fault, even though it really is. Dr. Melfi apologizes and says that it's his session that they need to focus on. Tony tells her that he understands since it was traumatizing for her. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if the Xanax is helping. Tony states that he hasn't had any panic attacks since. Dr. Melfi asks if he still has doubts. Tony says that he will still come to therapy and notes that it does have good ideas for him in his life on how to cope. Later, the group attends Aprile's funeral. Silvio takes this time to ask Tony why Junior has been made acting boss and no Tony. Tony tells Silvio that Junior is content and thinks that he is the leader. However, Tony says that everyone knows that he makes the decisions in the Mafia. Altieri notes that he is concerned about the money. Tony tells Altieri that he is too concerned about things and that is his major problem. Tony notes that Junior is unaware of the kick back to Aprile. Tony says that with Junior receiving the title he is a happy camper. Silvio comes to realize that Junior will be focused on and they will be able to run things undetected by the police. Hesh agrees that Tony made the smart move. Barese adds that now Tony has control of Bloomfield and the union. Altieri warns Tony that he needs to keep Junior in line. Tony says that he can and notes that he is Junior's favorite nephew. The men throw their soil and flowers on Aprile's coffin. Tony looks down for a brief second and continues to walk on. AJ watches from afar at his father interacting with everyone. Christopher tells Tony that the FBI is watching the funeral and taking pictures. Meadow also sees AJ watching and gives him a look that tells him that she was right. AJ watches as Paulie whispers something to Tony. Tony smiles at AJ when he sees him watching on and the episode ends with AJ staring in concern back at his father."

Paulie and Silvio sit outside to guard while Tony, Junior, Palmice, Barese, Curto, and Altieri meet. Junior states that they have all figured everything out in case the indictments occur. Junior asks Altieri if all of his concerns were answered. Altieri states that a lot of ground was covered and he's satisfied. The meeting is adjourned. After the rest of the captains leave, Junior and Palmice stop Tony. Junior states that he has no doubt that Altieri is the rat. Tony agrees and notes that they had a meeting about things that they already discussed. Tony knows that Altieri is wearing a wire. Junior tells Tony he is giving him approval to take out a hit on Altieri and adds that Tony needs to send a message to everyone else about it. Tony thanks Junior and Palmice and they part. When Junior and Palmice leave, Tony smirks after them. Later that night, Christopher takes Altieri to a hotel. The two have a conversation about the different types of girls that they like. Altieri notes that he heard Christopher hated Russian girls. Christopher states he was just bitter about one that used to hang out with Junior, but Tony's mistress, Irina, is very fine. Christopher states that the girls they are seeing tonight are friends of Irina's. Altieri asks Christopher if he has enough cologne on. Christopher states that he is wearing enough. Altieri states that Christopher has the advantage since he's younger. Christopher promises Altieri that he'll be happy after tonight. The men arrive at the hotel room and knock on the door. One of the girls comes outside into the hallway. She looks at Altieri in a seductive way and heads over to the next room to get the other girl. Altieri is really excited and heads into the room with Christopher. Christopher offers Altieri a seat and Altieri sits down. When he does, Silvio bursts into the room. Altieri tries to draw his weapon, but Christopher is able to stop him from drawing. Silvio aims a silenced pistol at Altieri's head. Altieri curses at the men and asks them if they are aware he is a captain. Silvio suggests to Altieri that he call for help on his FBI wire. Altieri realizes that they've found out he's a rat. Silvio realizes that Altieri probably isn't wearing a wire tonight. Christopher adds that Altieri didn't have time to put anything decent on. Altieri mutters forgiveness to God and Silvio shoots him. Blood spatter and brain matter hit the table and lamp in front of him and Altieri falls to the floor dead. At the Soprano residence, Meadow and her boyfriend are having a romantic night while watching a scary movie. The boyfriend stops for a moment and tells Meadow he thinks that someone is at her back gate. Meadow turns off the television and listens to see if she hears something. Outside, someone is heard calling the name, Settimia. The two freak out and wonder what is going on. Meadow sees Livia outside and wonders how she got out of Green Grove. AJ hears the noise from upstairs as well and gets some clothes on. Livia shouts outside and yells for Cakey to go get Settimia. AJ shouts down to Livia and says it's only him. Livia states that Cakey sounds like he has whooping cough and tells AJ to get under the vaporizer. Meadow runs to the back door to let Livia in. Livia still thinks Meadow is Settimia and she tells her that she is never speaking to her again. Meadow tries to calm down Livia and tells her that Settimia is dead and she is Meadow. Livia seems to become her old self again and remembers Meadow. She tells Meadow that she can't stay in the house after all that's happened. The doorbell rings and AJ answers the door. A police officer comes into the home. Livia asks the police officer to take Settimia out of her house. The officer notes that it is one in the morning and asks Livia why she's walking out alone this late at night. Livia tells him to shut up. The police officer tells Meadow that they got some complaints from the neighbors. Meadow tells the officer that Livia is their grandmother. The officer asks Livia if she knows these children. Livia says that she knows Meadow and AJ are her grandchildren. The next day at therapy, Dr. Melfi asks Tony about Livia coming to the house last night. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that she thought she was going to see her sister, Settimia. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Livia is getting tested for Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Melfi notes that it's been a long odyssey with Livia. Tony agrees that things have been difficult. Tony is upset and tells Dr. Melfi that Green Grove is transferring Livia to the nursing unit in the home which she dreaded all along. Dr. Melfi notes that it's interesting that her memory loss started after he was almost killed. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he really thinks it was a carjacking. Tony admits to her that he knows it wasn't a carjacking and he thinks that he knows who was behind everything. He says that he isn't going to go there with the conversation. Dr. Melfi thinks that Tony is overall reluctant to even confront the situation. She notes that around the time of the shooting he was having hallucinations of Isabella who was seen as a protective and loving mother. Dr. Melfi believes that Tony's subconscious was telling him something. Dr. Melfi notes that before the shooting Tony had mentioned Livia talking about news stories of mothers that were throwing their babies out windows. Tony is getting really agitated and tells Dr. Melfi to stop talking indirectly. Tony asks Dr. Melfi if she is really trying to tell him that Livia tried to have him murdered because of the fact he put Livia in a nursing home. Dr. Melfi notes that Tony also had the dream where the duck flew away with his penis. Tony notes Livia never threatened to do anything like that to him. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that most patients find their own ways of breaking through their issues, but since Tony's life is in danger she is willing to put the cards on the table to help him. Dr. Melfi honestly believes that Livia has borderline personality disorder. Tony is doubtful, but Dr. Melfi reads it from her book. The book says that borderline personality disorder involves unstable relationships, affective instability, intense anxiety, and joylessness. Dr. Melfi further adds that the phobias and paranoia are the only things that seem real while the real world and real people are peripheral and have no love or compassion for others. Livia is known to create bitterness and conflict amongst members of their family and that encompasses borderline personality disorder. Tony throws the glass table across the room and shatters. Tony gets straight into Dr. Melfi's face and curses at her. He states that they are talking about his mother and that is not a light subject. He tells Dr. Melfi that he is done with therapy and doesn't want to meet with her any longer. He notes that she is lucky he doesn't give her a good beating before he leaves. Tony leaves the office. Dr. Melfi locks her door and puts a chair in front of it so Tony can't get back inside. At Vesuvio, Rosalie tells Carmela that Aprile's work in the Mafia was what killed him because the stress caused the cancer. Carmela notes that when Aprile was the boss everything was peaceful and Tony's attempted assassination put an end to that peace. Rosalie notes that it's hard to say how Aprile would have ended up if he had lived longer. Rosalie notes that Angie Bonpensiero has been a shell since Pussy disappeared. Artie comes out and serves the women some food. Carmela notes that with the way Artie is serving them food they will walk out of the restaurant as hippos. Rosalie honestly tells Artie she thinks that the new restaurant is better than the old Vesuvio was. Artie says that there are just a few things that need to be worked out with the new restaurant and then it will be ready to run. Artie is happy that he got the insurance money for the restaurant. Artie asks Carmela about Livia. Carmela tells Artie that the doctors think Livia is displaying signs of Alzheimer's. Artie is sad to hear that and notes that he's known Livia since he was little. He notes that Tony is probably a wreck and Carmela tells him that Tony is beside himself at this point. Artie notes that Tony has a lot on his plate right now and leaves the women so they can eat. Artie goes back into the kitchen to find Charmaine preparing food. Artie asks her why she's hiding in the kitchen and notes that Carmela and Rosalie are sitting outside. Artie asks Charmaine when she is going to be willing to bury the hatchet. Charmaine tells Artie that Carmela is like a sister to her, but that she doesn't want the new Vesuvio to be another hangout for the Mafia. Artie notes that publicity like that is good for the restaurant, but Charmaine disagrees saying that is publicity they need to avoid. Back in the dining room, Father Intintola has joined the women at their table. Rosalie is glad that Father Intintola was able to make it to the restaurant and notes to him that the food is great. Father Intintola feels that something special is going on if the women were invited to the restaurant before the grand opening. Father Intintola tells Rosalie that he was over at Carmela's last night making zabaglione with her. Carmela tells Father Intintola he did most of the cooking of the food. Father Intintola wishes that Tony would have allowed him a moment to talk about the carjacking. Carmela agrees with him. Father Intintola tells the ladies that he has to return to his table to order some food. Carmela tells Father Intintola to sit with them. Rosalie agrees and asks Father Intintola how the watch is. Father Intintola tells her that the watch works perfectly and thanks her. Carmela looks at the watch and asks Rosalie if it was Aprile's watch. Rosalie says that it is and she softly sobs in remembrance of Aprile. Father Intintola holds Rosalie's hand, softly stroking it. Carmela takes notice to this gesture. Later that night, a man walks down an alley after buying several cases of beer. He suddenly trips and spills everything on the ground. When he gets up, he sees Altieri's dead body with a rat stuffed in his mouth. In an undisclosed location, Agent Harris leads Tony into a room with several FBI agents. Agent Harris tells them that Tony came willingly. Tony states he only came because Agent Harris threatened to wait until Meadow and AJ got home. Tony arrives downstairs to see Agent Grasso and Chief Frank Cubitoso. Tony takes a seat in a chair. Chief Cubitoso notes to Tony that they are all aware that there was an attempt on his life a few days ago. They know that Tony has enemies and he may be through with holding any type of power in New Jersey. Tony tells Chief Cubitoso that he already had this conversation with Agent Harris and once again states that he is not going to help them. Chief Cubitoso shows Tony a tape with a recording on it, but Tony still has no interest in anything. Chief Cubitoso tells Tony that he and Agent Grasso had a colloquy about their shared Italian heritage. Chief Cubitoso says that they all come from different parts of Italy, but they all share common cultural ideas. Chief Cubitoso says there might be a chance Tony will change his mind about testifying. Tony tells Chief Cubitoso to get to the point. Chief Cubitoso plays the tape where Junior and Livia had a conversation about the hit on Tony. In the conversation, Junior alludes to the fact that Tony had her put in a nursing home and Livia tells Junior that Tony is seeing a psychiatrist and she only wonders what he tells them. Tony realizes the FBI wired Green Grove. Chief Cubitoso takes credit for this and notes everyone else thought it was a waste of time. Chief Cubitoso fast forwards through parts of the tape and starts to play it again at the part when Livia tells Junior about Cakey after his lobotomy looked like Tony and it was better that Cakey died than live in a lobotomized state. Tony continues to listen as Livia tells Junior that Altieri, Barese, and Curto all met in Green Grove after their mother moved in. Tony then hears Junior making the statement that he has to kill Tony. Tony has a lot to take in. At the nursing unit, Artie visits Livia in her room. Artie asks Livia if she remembers who he is. Livia says that she does remember Artie and mistakenly says that he and John played baseball together. Artie corrects her and says that he played baseball with Tony. Livia tells Artie that she remembers now and asks him what is wrong with her. She asks Artie how he's doing. Artie tells her that he's doing great. Livia asks Artie how his mother is doing and asks if he calls her every day. Artie reminds Livia that his mother passed away almost six months ago. Artie tells Livia he brought her something from Vesuvio. Livia says she does remember Vesuvio and remembers that Artie's father used to be the owner. Artie says that she is right and tells her that he has a new restaurant now. Artie has brought Livia some Cavatelli. Livia doesn't seem happy about it. Artie asks Livia what is wrong. Livia tells Artie that he is a good man for coming to visit her. She tells him that after what Tony did to him she doesn't see how she can look Artie in the face. Artie asks Livia what Tony did. Livia tells him that she doesn't see how he can't blame Tony for setting fire to Vesuvio. Artie is taken aback by this news. Livia says that Artie is a good man if he can forgive Tony for that and notes that they are lucky that nobody was killed in the fire. At the Bada Bing, Paulie and Christopher are hanging out in the backroom. Paulie tells Christopher that Altieri's wake is tonight. Christopher tells Paulie it will be ruined because he phoned in a bomb scare. Silvio thinks Christopher may have went a little over the top with that. Tony comes into the room and the three are at attention when he does. Tony tells the men that it was Junior and Palmice that took out the hit against him. Christopher notes that this shouldn't be surprising news. Paulie asks Tony how he knows for sure. Tony says that there is no room for interpretation for that question. Silvio can't believe Junior would kill his own nephew. Tony tells the men that they need to plan things out and make no mistakes. Paulie thinks that Junior is going to try and figure out how to finish Tony off first. Christopher adds that this time Junior won't just give out the hit to a couple of gangsters. Silvio states that Junior might give the hit to Signore because Palmice has been given a huge promotion so he won't just be a hitman. Tony states that Signore has to disappear without anyone knowing. Tony states he just passed his Coast Guard test, which means he knows what he's going to do. Paulie asks Tony if there is anything else. Tony tells them that his ear hurts. At the Soprano residence, Carmela gives Tony a sleeping pill so he can actually get some rest tonight. Tony asks Carmela what kind of a person he is if his own mother wants him killed. Carmela tells Tony that the problem doesn't lie with Tony, but with Livia. She says that everyone knows Livia has always been a different sort of breed. Tony states that it isn't the point. Carmela reminds Tony that over the years, Livia's condition has steadily become worse. Carmela is surprised that there aren't any contracts on Tony's sisters for abandoning Livia. Carmela tells Tony that he is the better person for trying to make Livia's relationship with the family work. Tony says that after two men with nine millimeter pistols tried to kill him, his self-esteem was drained. Carmela says that she could kill Livia with her own hands at this point. Tony tells Carmela that she needs to play the card of the concerned daughter-in-law and not let Livia suspect anything. Carmela tells Tony that she isn't concerned about business at this point and even states she thinks Livia's Alzheimer's is an act so she can't be held responsible. Tony knows that he and Junior have had their problems with business, but he thinks Junior is also angry at Tony because he made fun of him for his great performance of oral sex. He says that oral sex and psychiatry caused this war. Carmela tells Tony he had to see the psychiatrist because of Livia. Tony says that when he sees the guys all he can feel is humiliation. Tony tells Carmela he is going to take care of Junior and Palmice and from that he'll get satisfaction. The next day, Tony parks his car along the shore. Silvio opens the trunk and gets out a huge fish. Tony walks down the boardwalk and sees Chucky Signore in his new boat. Signore is startled to see Tony and asks him what he's doing here. Tony tells Signore he is here to take his new boat, the Stugots, out onto the river. Tony is holding the large fish in his hand and tells Signore to look at how great the fish is. Tony reaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a gun. He shoots Signore until the clip is empty. Signore's dead body falls into the boat. Silvio pulls out some chains and cinderblocks from the trunk of the car. Tony and Silvio get into the boat and drive it out onto the river. Dr. Melfi is about to leave her office when Tony arrives. When Dr. Melfi sees him, she shuts the door and locks him out. Tony pleads with her to open the door because he needs to talk to her. Dr. Melfi is too frightened by the events that happened earlier in the day for her to listen to him. Dr. Melfi tells Tony she is calling the police because he has given her no other option but to do so. Tony again asks her to open up. Dr. Melfi dials the police and tells Tony that if anything happens to her the police will hear it on the other end of the phone. Tony says that they can go down to the coffee shop to talk if she is more comfortable with that. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if she has his word that he will not harm her physically. Tony says that she has his word nothing will happen to her. Dr. Melfi hangs up the phone. She takes a pair of scissors and puts them under the sleeve of her outfit. She turns on the lights and unlocks the door. Dr. Melfi sits behind her desk and Tony sits on the other end. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that she isn't happy that she was right about Livia. She asks Tony if he's had any dreams since he heard the FBI tapes. Tony says he has had some sex dreams involving Jeanie Cusamano. Tony says that he is making love with Jeanie Cusamano in his dreams, but he can never see her face. Dr. Melfi thinks that this might be feelings of worthlessness over the fact that Livia tried to have him killed. Tony tells them that one of the reasons that he was almost killed was because he was seeing her for therapy. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that their conversations are privileged and she can't be compelled to testify against anyone. Tony says that his enemies might know that, but they might not. Dr. Melfi notes that she doesn't even know any of Tony's associates because he never mentioned them by name. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he feels she is danger. Dr. Melfi doesn't think that is a fair assessment at all. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that nobody cares about fair in his line of work. Dr. Melfi asks Tony what she's supposed to do about that. Tony tells her that she needs to get out of town tonight. Dr. Melfi states that she can't just leave on short notice. She states that she has a life and patients to tend to. She notes that some of her patients are fragile and could commit suicide while she's away. Tony states that if Dr. Melfi is killed then it won't change the difference of their outcomes. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he is sorry about all of this and assures her that he is going to take care of the problem and then she can come back. Dr. Melfi knows that people are going to be killed. Tony tells her not to worry about that and tells her instead to take care of herself. Tony adds that the police aren't going to give her anything because she can't give them any information. Tony tells her again that she needs to leave town. He tells her that she has been a good doctor to him and he appreciates that. He leaves the office. Tony arrives at Satriale's to find Artie in the parking lot. Artie has a rifle in his hands and he aims it at Tony. Tony asks Artie what is going on. Artie asks Tony how he could have done what he did. Tony thinks that Junior hired Artie to kill him and tells him to just pull the trigger because he doesn't care anymore. Artie tells Tony that the restaurant was like his child and three generations of his family worked over the same stoves. Artie tells Tony that even Livia cherishes all of her memories at Vesuvio. Artie tells Tony not to say that Livia is lying because there is no reason for Livia to do that. Tony asks Artie what Livia told him. Artie asks Tony that he not treat him like he's stupid. He is angry because when Tony set fire to Vesuvio he made Artie part of a criminal conspiracy. Tony states to Artie that he doesn't know what Livia told him, but he says that they do know that two arson investigators stated that the fire was an accident. Tony asks Artie why he would even blow up Vesuvio. Artie yells that he believes that it was because Tony thought in a twisted way that blowing up the restaurant would stop a hit that Junior was going to stage in Vesuvio. Artie asks Tony what kind of sick logic that is. Tony asks Artie to think about it and ask him if he's stupid enough to do that. Tony tells Artie that Livia is going senile and even Artie can see that. Artie sobs and says that he does love his new restaurant a lot, but it'll never be Vesuvio. Tony swears to God that he never burnt down Vesuvio. Artie tells Tony to look him in the eye and swear it to him again. Tony again swears to Artie that he didn't burn down Vesuvio and he swears on Livia. Artie lowers the rifle and then smashes it to pieces against his car. He gets in and peels out of the lot. At the Soprano residence, Junior and Livia once again join the family for a meal. Tony states that it's nice that they all are able to eat a Sunday dinner together. Nobody else is really talking. Carmela breaks the silence and tells Livia that the nursing unit is good if they let the patients out for family occasions. Livia says that she doesn't have anything to admit. Meadow tells everyone she needs to leave in ten minutes to study with Hunter. Livia asks them if the pork is cooked. Tony recognizes that Meadow is going to be on her own soon and AJ will follow a few years after. Livia tells everyone that last week in the paper she read about a family in Saint Luis Obispo that died of trichinosis which can be found in uncooked pork. Tony notes that the article was in the paper last year. Livia mocks that Tony knows everything. Tony asks Junior about the indictments. Junior says that his lawyer told him that the indictment hasn't been released yet. Carmela asks Livia if she agrees that business should not be discussed at the table. Livia doesn't say anything. Tony asks Livia if Artie came by to see her the other day. Livia asks Tony who Artie is. Tony reminds Livia that Artie is a friend of his from elementary school that owns a restaurant. Livia says that she doesn't remember seeing anyone named Artie and asks if he's talking about visiting in the house or elsewhere. Tony and Junior look at Livia, both of them knowing that Livia is putting on an act. At the church, Artie visits Father Intintola and tells him that he's lost his belief in everything. Father Intintola notes that Artie moved away from God some time ago. Father Intintola asks if it's fair to say that recent events were not the cause of his move from God. Artie says it is fair to say that. He tells Father Intintola that every time he comes to church his mind begins to wander. He says he can only stare at the stained glass and he's full of rage. He tells Father Intintola that he doesn't just hate Tony, but all men and life. Father Intintola asks Artie if he tried to talk to Charmaine about this. Artie states that he can't do that because it would ruin her. Father Intintola states that Charmaine is a strong woman and she will find out one way or the other. Artie says he didn't go to the insurance when the restaurant was burned down. He says that legally he could have been hit with a defamation suit. Father Intintola tells Artie that his heart is telling him the answer. He knows that Artie hasn't told Charmaine because she is going to tell him to go to the police and this will jeopardize his new restaurant. Father Intintola tells Artie that he needs to stay strong. Artie tells Father Intintola that he is getting off of the important subject. At Satriale's, Christopher arrives late to a meeting where Paulie, Silvio, and Tony are waiting. Tony tells the men that he has something to tell them and he wanted them to hear it from him. Tony takes a deep breath and tells them that for the last five months he's been seeing a psychiatrist because of his panic attacks. The men stay silent for several moments and Tony asks them to all speak their minds. Silvio tells Tony that he trusts that he did this with complete discretion. Silvio also speaks on behalf of Pussy and notes that Pussy would feel the same way. Tony assures them he never spoke of business and the psychiatrist doesn't know anyone's names. Tony adds Junior knows that he is seeing a psychiatrist and is using that as a reason for the war. Tony tells them that if there is anything they want to see they need to say it now because this discussion is not happening again. Paulie tells Tony he's heard worse things in life and he was seeing a therapist a year ago. The men are surprised by this. Paulie states he had issues and has since resolved them. Silvio says that their business is struggling and he thinks it would be appropriate for them to discuss their painful and stressful times, but he knows that will never happen. Tony asks Christopher how he is feeling about this. Christopher asks Tony if it's like marriage counseling. Tony says it's similar. Christopher gets up and leaves the room. Carmela arrives at the church to visit Father Intintola. When she gets there, she finds Father Intintola sitting with Rosalie in his study. He is eating some of her baked ziti and they are discussing food. She sees Rosalie wipe some of the ziti off of his face and the two are smiling and laughing. Carmela is hurt by this scene and she walks outside. She dumps the food she made for Father Intintola into the garbage can and leaves. At Vesuvio, Artie sits down to eat a meal while Charmaine discusses with Adriana a job proposal. Charmaine is pleased with Adriana's abilities and tells her that she's hired. After she leaves, Charmaine sits with Artie and tells him that Adriana catches on to things very fast and is proud of the fact that Adriana wants to be a music manager. Charmaine tells Artie that everything is going well. Artie smiles at her happiness. Charmaine asks Artie what it was he wanted to tell her. Artie tells her that he likes the bar stools and that's what he wanted to tell her. Tony comes downstairs in the morning very happy. Meadow is the first to notice this. At Palmice's house, Palmice yells into the house after JoJo and tells her that if Signore calls the house she needs to call him and tell him. When she doesn't respond, Palmice curses and asks if she heard him. JoJo comes to the door and yells that she heard him the first time. Palmice tells JoJo to go take a Midol. JoJo flips Palmice the middle finger behind his back and slams the door shut. Palmice begins his morning jog. As he runs down a back road, a car begins to slowly follow him. Palmice takes notice to it and he continues to run. He doesn't like the scene and suddenly bolts into the woods. Christopher and Paulie are in the car and they get out to pursue him. Palmice is a fast runner and Christopher and Paulie have to work hard to catch up to him. Christopher fires several shots at him as he runs, but misses. Paulie runs right into a poison ivy patch and curses as he makes his way through. Palmice comes upon a small brook and trips as he tries to cross it. He falls into the water and tries to get up. Christopher catches up to Palmice and puts a bullet in his leg. Palmice falls down in pain and begs Christopher not to kill him. Paulie catches up and complains to Christopher that he got poison ivy all over his face and hands. Christopher tells Palmice that he knows that he shot Filone and never gave him a chance at all. Palmice tries to convince Christopher that it was Junior that shot Filone, not him. Christopher is not stupid and doesn't believe that at all. Paulie complains that the poison ivy is starting to make him itchy already. Against Palmice's pleas, Christopher and Paulie empty their gun magazines into Palmice's body. Palmice's body is riddle with bullets and he lets out one last groan before dying in the brook. Palmice's cell phone begins to ring as Paulie and Christopher leave the murder scene. Later, FBI agents move in to make their arrests in relation to the indictment. Agents are seen going to Junior's house first. Junior looks out the window instead of answering the door, but the FBI see him. They tell him that he is under arrest. Junior realizes the trouble he is in. FBI agents are later seen making arrests at Larry Boy Barese and Joseph ""Beppy"" Sasso's houses. Tony later watches on the news as Junior, Barese, Sasso, and 13 other members of the Soprano Crime Family were indicted on federal racketeering charges. Tony realizes that the FBI moved in before he was able to take care of Junior and notes that Junior is lucky to be alive. Meadow comes into her parents' room and sees Junior being led away on the television in handcuffs. Tony tells Meadow that he is ashamed that the police are making a decent businessman like Junior do the perpetrator walk. Meadow tells Tony not to act like he feels bad. On the news, U.S. Attorney Gene Conigliaro tells the viewers that the arrests were made after a long investigation of criminal activities that have taken place over the last four years. Conigliaro states that these arrests represent the heaviest blow to Mafia activities in New Jersey since the arrests in the 1980s. AJ comes into the room and Meadow tells him about Junior being arrested. AJ originally thinks that is cool, but Tony gives him a little smack on the back of his head for making that remark. The reports also state that among the people that were not arrested was Mikey Palmice and reports indicate that Palmice may have fled town when he heard about the indictments. JoJo Palmice insists that she knows nothing about Palmice's whereabouts. JoJo appears on the news and tells the reporters that Palmice went out for a jog to try out his new running shoes and he would be back later. JoJo cries and says that Palmice told her that he loved her and left, while we know that is not how Palmice acted when he left the house. Tony smiles to himself knowing the truth that Palmice is dead. The phone rings and one of Tony's government sources is on the phone. Down in the kitchen, Tony tells Carmela that the indictments sound better than they actually are. Tony says the reason he wasn't on the indictment was because the investigation was against Junior and Barese for a calling-card scam they were both working through as well as a Diamante technical stock. Tony says that since he wasn't involved in those activities he wasn't named. Tony does note to Carmela that Altieri did provide the FBI with some information before he was killed and the FBI does have information from his group from the meetings at Green Grove. Carmela realizes that the DA told Tony that there is an ongoing investigation into the Green Grove meetings. Tony says that everyone says that just so the case looks good, but he knows that they need to worry about that later. Tony's concerns are for the men that were arrested today and whether they will turn informant to avoid prosecution. Artie sees Father Intintola at his restaurant. Father Intintola asks him how he's doing. Artie tells him that business is good. Artie tells Father Intintola he wants to thank him for talking to him yesterday. Father Intintola asks Artie if he talked with Charmaine. Artie tells Father Intintola he didn't. He tells Father Intintola that in the church he thought about it and realizes that he can be a yes person or a no person. Father Intintola is confused about what Artie is trying to say. Artie says that Livia was always a negative person and as a kid he would hate to hear her rants. Father Intintola notes that Artie did say Tony was an unstable person. Artie says that he was angry at the time and states that while Tony is confusing and a little comfortable outside of the law he does know that doubting him would add to his sorrow. He says he doesn't see how he can take Livia's word over Tony's. Father Intintola states that Artie seems to be at peace and Artie says that he is. Later, Junior meets with Conigliaro in jail. Conigliaro notes that Junior's tenure as boss was relatively short and unusual in several ways. Conigliaro tells Junior that he is willing to drop all of the charges against him if he testifies that Tony is the boss of the New Jersey Family along with the help of the New York Syndicate in communication with Johnny Sack. Conigliaro tells Junior he wants to arrest Johnny Sack along with associates Mangano and Teresi. Junior retorts he wants a relationship with Angie Dickinson and notes that they will have to see who gets lucky first. Conigliaro asks Junior to corroborate information from informants and wiretaps that he was allowed to profit with Tony as boss, but he wasn't allowed to make policy and was left out of the loop. Conigliaro asks Junior how long he is willing to take the hits for Tony. He notes Junior is 70-years-old and asks him how long he thinks he has. Junior tells Conigliaro that Tony is not running things and as long as he's around, that will never happen. Carmela arrives home to find Father Intintola in the kitchen. Father Intintola takes the shopping bags out of her hands and puts them on the table. Carmela asks Father Intintola how he got inside. Father Intintola tells Carmela that Liliana let him in and then told him she had to leave early. Father Intintola tells Carmela to be careful of the upcoming storm that will hit New Jersey. Carmela asks Father Intintola if he wants coffee. Father Intintola states that if Carmela is making it then he does. Carmela asks Father Intintola not to start that behavior. Father Intintola tells her that it's practically cocktail hour. He asks Carmela how she is doing in lieu of the indictments. Carmela states that they are doing fine. Father Intintola refers back to their discussion a few months ago and asks Carmela if these recent events have compelled Tony to re-examine his life. Carmela isn't paying attention and sees a bag on the counter thinking that Meadow bought something with her credit card. Father Intintola states that it is his purchase and he says he bought the movie, One True Thing. He says he bought it so they could watch it and she could take her mind off of the stressors. The two drink their wine and Carmela asks Father Intintola if he's staying for dinner. Father Intintola knows something is wrong and asks Carmela if she needs to tell him something. Carmela says she wants to know so she can figure out how many steaks to defrost since Tony won't be home. Father Intintola tries to tell Carmela his concern is for Tony. Carmela tells Father Intintola that they both know that Tony doesn't care about examining his life. Father Intintola states that is the big reason why they need to talk to him. Carmela states that Tony is a sinner and Father Intintola comes into his home, eats his steaks, and uses the television and entertainment center. Father Intintola states that the DVD is for her. Carmela notes that last week she told him that she didn't like Renee Zellweger. Father Intintola admits he doesn't remember hearing that. Carmela states that if Father Intintola wants to watch One True Thing, then he can at least admit his true intentions. Carmela knows he only does this for the women to get gifts and great meals. Father Intintola is insulted by this, but Carmela states that she also feels he likes the whiff of sexuality that he feels but can't act on. Father Intintola notes he did admit that he had feelings for her, but that he has been dealing with them so he can continue to pastoral duties. Carmela asks Father Intintola how Rosalie fits into this equation. Father Intintola realizes why Carmela feels the way she does. Carmela tells Father Intintola she appreciates his religious counseling and their chats and she is fond of him, but she thinks he needs to evaluate himself. She thinks he has a goal of manipulating women in need of spiritual guidance. Father Intintola is left speechless and he leaves the home. At the nursing unit, Tony grabs a pillow off of a gurney and starts to walk down the hall. A nurse stops him and tells him that she is glad Carmela found him. Tony is confused and asks what she is talking about. The nurse is aware that nobody informed him yet of the situation. The nurse tells Tony that Livia has had a stroke. She tells Tony that the news of Junior's arrest upset Livia and the EMTs have just stabilized her for the ride to St. Vincent's Hospital. Tony spots the EMTs taking Livia out. Tony stops them and gets down to Livia's level. He tells her that he knows what she did and he can't believe she would do this to him. The EMT tells Tony that her speech has been affected by the stroke and Livia can't answer him. Tony disregards this. He tells Livia that he heard the FBI tapes and she knows what she tried to do. The EMT again tries to get Tony away from Livia, but Tony orders him not to get in the way. Tony tells Livia that Junior is in jail now and he is now on top. He tells Livia that he doesn't die easy and he will live a long, happy life unlike Livia's state. Security tries to take Tony away, but he is able to get free from them. Tony yells that he tried to be there for her and she tried to have him killed. He starts to get very angry when he sees what he thinks to be a smile on Livia's face. The nurse tries to tell Tony that Livia doesn't understand anything right now, but Tony is too angry. Livia is led out and Tony is also taken out by hospital security. Later, Tony drives around the city trying to take everything in. He stops at Dr. Melfi's office. When he walks in, a janitor is cleaning her office. He tells Tony that she went on vacation. The power suddenly goes off in the office. Tony realizes that Dr. Melfi took his advice and left town. He hopes that she is safe. Tony, Carmela, Meadow, and AJ are later driving in the storm. Meadow tells Tony that he should pull over because they aren't going to make it to Aunt Patty's house. Tony replies that there's a reason he bought the SUV so they could get through the rain. Carmela states that Meadow is right and states that she can barely see the road in front of them. Tony realizes they are on Walnut Parkway and states he has an idea. The SUV pulls over and everyone grabs umbrellas. They knock on the doors to Nuovo Vesuvio and Artie opens the doors. Carmela tells Artie that they picked up the kids at school, but they can't get home because a tree is down on their street. Tony states they've been on the road since seven o'clock and everyone is hungry. Artie states that he has no power and he's closing when the last customers leave. Meadow tells Tony that McDonald's will be opened for sure. Artie doesn't want to disappoint them and tells them to come inside. Paulie and Silvio are inside taking cover from the rain.

Dennis' father, Henry, comes home with his arm full of presents, he tells his wife Alice that he has the perfect place to hide Dennis' Christmas presents- the old truck in the attic, Alice says that's the first place Dennis will look, but Henry is confident because he has the only key.

Meanwhile Dennis and Tommy are hard at work trying to open the Trunk, Dennis has a handful of keys and is trying every one , Dennis is in search of that sleigh his grandfather was supposed to have sent him.

When Henry catches them he banishes Dennis from the attic.

In the next scene we see Mr. Wilson and his wife in their living room somebody is ringing their doorbell incessantly, Mr. Wilson thinks it's Dennis and says if it us he will send Dennis straight home, it turns out to be Henry with all of Dennis' presents , he asks Mr. Wilson if he can hide them for him. Mr Wilson hides them in his hall closet. Since Dennis and Alice are out shopping, Mrs Wilson invites him to stay for coffee.

He spends about an hour drinking coffee and telling stories about Dennis when he decides it's time to head home, when they open the front door we hear Dennis ( he is off camera) playing silent night on his bugle, Henry tells him not to play it in the yard and Dennis runs up to them thinking they want him to play it in mr Wilson house, but mr Wilson says he doesn't want to hear it on a bugle, Dennis wishes him a merry Christmas.

Dennis and Tommy are on the prowl for Dennis' presents , he heads to his parents room, where his mother is on the bed wrapping presents , Dennis slyly looks under the bed and tries to then trick her into revealing the presents hiding place but she is too smart for his tricks ...or so she thinks ...Dennis is stymied but never defeated he comes up with an ingenious plan to find the presents ...he has bought his father an alarm clock and he sets it for an hour in to the future- 3 pm , he asks his mother to wrap it and tricks her into immediately putting it with the rest of his presents , even the one he is giving Fremont- Mr. Wilson's dog...a bone.

2 nd commercial break

Alice gives the presents to Mr Wilson who puts them in the closet with the rest. Fremont sniffs the bone and scratches at the closet door, mr Wilson gets mad and puts the dog outdoors. Dennis is watching his father put together Christmas lights for the Christmas tree, he asks his father what time it is ...his father tells him it 3pm...Dennis tries to hear the alarm clock but is disappointed that he doesn't hear it...that's because it's going off in mr Wilson's closet. Wilson thinks it's the doorbell...when he opens the door Fremont runs in and begins scratching at the closet door again. The Alarm clock has a snooze feature where it stops and turns back in 5 minutes later. Once again Wilson puts Fremont outside .

Wilson concludes that it's Fremont who is ringing the doorbell ...he jumping up and ringing it with his nose....when the alarm clock goes off again...Wilson refuses to open the front door and fall for Fremonts trick.

Dennis still can't find his sled and wants to write a letter to Santa Claus to insure he gets the sled...but he can't write yet. He goes over to Wilson's house to see if Wilson will write the letter ...while there he sees Fremont scratching at the closet door and immediately deduces that the presents are in the closet...but Wilson won't let him in the closet and sends him home

When Dennis gets home he puts on a sad show for his parents about how the Wilsons will be all alone on Christmas Eve...and they don't have a tree to decorate...Alice is so moved she tells Dennis to go invite them over ...Dennis is happy ...and also knows the presents will be unguarded.

Later on the Wilson's are over, and Mr Wilson is helping decorate the tree, he is wearing his Christmas tie, and is careful it doesn't get stains because it's brand new.

Dennis runs to the window and announces that it's snowing, everybody goes excitedly to the window. Dennis is in the Christmas spirit and begins playing silent night on his bugle but his mother stops him and they all decide to sing it instead...after awhile everyone stops singing because Dennis is singing it so wonderfully they all bask in his childish innocence and the depth in which he sings the song. Mr. Wilson tears up and uses his tie to wipe his eyes.

Dennis asks if he can go to the kitchen for more cookies , and while he is gone Alice says that put her in the Christmas spirit and mr Wilson says that Dennis is an angel.

Dennis meanwhile has sneaked over to Mr Wilson's house and opens the closet to see the sled he wanted."

At first he's thought to have been a Japanese spy, but it later turns out he was a 0SS agent who led a troop of Japanese soldiers into an ambush. He'd initially been mistaken for Ken Ito when the real Ken Ito was killed by gunfire during the attack at Pearl harbor, and the name change was sanctioned by the 0SS, so no action against him is taken except that a ceremony in his honor goes ahead under his real name, Kenishiro Habanito. He'd met the real Ken Ito at Pearl harbor while working as a laborer and the two of them had become fast friends. They'd been out fishing together when the real Ken Ito was blasted by a Japanese fighter and killed, falling off their fishing boat. The remains had been washed ashore into a cave years earlier, and were mummified there; the body is identified by DNA analysis. In the process of the investigation it's discovered that Ken is being blackmailed, and that this man has stolen files from a Naval records library nearby. The agents apprehend this man and it is he who first makes the allegation that Kenishiro was a Japanese spy, which old 0SS records later disprove. Kenishiro is not charged with any crime because the name change was sanctioned by the 0SS when he was returned to the Navy after his mission. The ceremony honoring him proceeds as planned except that he's honored under his real name, Kenishiro Habanito. The episode honors the men and women who were killed at Pearl harbour regardless of race, color or nationally."

Can DW get Bushroot before he turns everyone into plants?",[],TV-Y7,Release date,"['Tad Stones', 'Alan Zaslove']","['', '', '']",[],"['venus flytrap', 'plant person', 'magnifying glass', 'rescue', 'motorcycle']",[],"Darkwing Duck opens his case files regarding his nemesis, Bushroot, regaling the audience with the plant-duck's origin and first encounter with Darkwing.

Bushroot was once a scientist at the local University, named Reginald Bushroot. His laboratory space was shared by two large ducks named Gary and Larson, as well as the beautiful Dr. Rhoda Dendron, whom Bushroot secretly has a crush on. Bushroot's major project was trying to combine the dna of a plant to a person, in hopes that a person would gain nourishment through plant photosynthesis. However, Dr's Gary and Larson deride Reginald's plans, and the Dean of the University decides to cut funding for the project as well.

With noone else to turn to, Reginald tests the experiment on himself. However, while the photosynthesis process does energize his body, the chemical reaction turns him into a living plant-duck. At first upset at this, Bushroot then realizes that his state allows him to talk to and control plants. He first uses this power to do away with the annoying Drs. Gary and Larson. Their death prompts Darkwing Duck and Launchpad to investigate. Assuming that Bushroot is attacking those who thwarted his experiments, Darkwing tries to protect the Dean. This plan fails when the Dean is almost killed by some plants that Bushroot has control over. Darkwing manages to distract the plants, and the Dean manages to get away.

After explaining what happened to Dr Dendron, she refuses to believe that Bushroot meant anyone harm, as he was always a very meek sort of person. Bushroot manages to overhear these words, and assumes that this means that the doctor loves him. Going off this assumption, he kidnaps her, intending to turn her into a plant hybrid like himself.

Darkwing manages to thwart his plans, and Bushroot attempts to kill him, only to end up under the rotors of a lawnmower. It seems this might have been the end of the story, but Bushroot managed to survive, and is in the process of growing back to normal from his current state."

Darkwing reluctantly agrees, seeing something odd regarding a building from the corner of his eye, but paying it no mind when a better look doesn't show anything off.

They go to a Hamburger Hippo outlet and Launchpad orders a large meal. As Darkwing pays for it, Launchpad sits down and takes off his scarf so he won't get any stains on it. The duo finishes their meal and head home. On their way home, Launchpad remembers that he left his scarf at the Hamburger Hippo stand and they return to get it. Curiously, they find the stand gone when they arrive, with only a stand-shaped mark in the ground proving there once truly stood a building. The cook approaches them anxiously and tells them that he heard a noise out back and went to take a look. The building was gone by the time he turned around and that's all he can say about the case. Darkwing starts searching for clues with his magnifying glass, his eye for detail preventing him from noticing even more structures disappearing around him. As they are about to wrap things up due to lack of clues, Launchpad notices that his hamburger on-the-go is gone and spots it being carried off by ants. He tries to get his burger back, but the ants are stronger than he is. Launchpad wants to go after them, but Darkwing considers this irrelevant and calls it a night. Had they'd followed, however, they'd have found the one behind the disappearing buildings. His name is Lilliput and he invented both a helmet to communicate with ants and a gun that can alter the size of the target. His scheme involves shrinking down buildings to a size at which his ants can collect them for him and then setting them up on his miniature golf course: Goony Golf. He berates the ants who stole the hamburger for the unacceptable risks they are taking just to stuff their mouths, but lets them keep the burger and continues with his ""shopping"" for the night.

Darkwing and Launchpad are sleeping in when Gosalyn and Honker burst in and Gosalyn insists that her father keeps his promise to take her and Honker to Goony Golf. Darkwing tries to brush her off, so Gosalyn starts playing inside the house. Preferring to keep his furniture and limbs, he relents. As they walk past the fence of Goony Golf, Launchpad points out the detail in the decoration and how much some of it looks like actual buildings in St. Canard. Drake is too tired to care. At the admission house, Launchpad orders a hotdog and has to take it back from ants when they run off with it, but again Drake pays it no mind. He has the hardest time staying awake as the four of them start playing, but is kept awake by his companions' unintentional shenanigans. Launchpad covers Drake in sand as he desperately tries to hit the ball, Gosalyn somehow manage to constantly slam the ball into her father's head, and Honker makes calculations, which Drake doesn't take seriously and gets in the way off. Launchpad realizes that his friend really is tired and offers to take care of the kids while he takes a nap. Drake lies down on a hill, but rolls down it against a miniature version of a Hamburger Hippo outlet. Upon close inspection of the object, he finds a miniature version of Launchpad's scarf on one of its stools and realizes he stumbled onto a clue in the case of the missing buildings. He promptly puts on his Darkwing Duck outfit and equally promptly is zapped with the size gun by Lilliput, who is smart enough to remain out of sight. He also sends a few ants after him to deal with the crimefighter.

At first, Darkwing thinks that his surroundings are still part of the miniature golf decor. This hypothesis is thrown out when he finds that a snail is real. His next guess is that he's dreaming, which is disproven when he pinches himself. The snail knocks him into the Hamburger Hippo stand, where the ants sent after him are enjoying lunch for the moment. They are bigger than Darkwing and also clearly hostile, so he makes a break for it. Once he gets away from the ants, he is almost stepped on by Gosalyn. This encounter makes him realize he has not been transported to some odd world of giants, which was his third theory, but that he himself has been shrunken. He attempts to get Launchpad's attention by climbing on a golf ball, but Launchpad doesn't see him and hits it far across the course. Elsewhere, Lilliput is directing his ants where to put one of the new buildings. The hunters group of ants approaches to tell their boss they lost Darkwing. Lilliput finds evidence they let their appetite take precedence again, but forgives them. He provides the ants with miniature dune buggies to chase down Darkwing more effectively.

Darkwing climbs up to the top of the windmill he landed on and uses his cape to glide over to Launchpad and get his attention, but the sidekick thinks that he is a bug and swats Darkwing away. Darkwing lands on the ground and finds himself targeted by the motorized ant troops. Darkwing manages to steal one car and trash the others, but in the process rides up a dinosaur statue and ramps off it into another building. This one is a bank and Darkwing witnesses the ants barging in, cracking open the safe, and collecting the money in a miniature security van. Using some wires, Darkwing disguises himself as an ant and hitches a ride. The ants take the money to Lilliput at the admission house, finally revealing to Darkwing the mastermind behind the entire operation. Lilliput unshrinks the money brought in and is not fooled by Darkwing's disguise. He tries to smash him, but misses and accidentally flings Darkwing out of the house when he steps on a golf club. By sheer coincidence, Darkwing lands on Honkers glasses and is finally noticed by his team. The four launch an assault on the admission house, but the ants hand their master his size gun. Gosalyn is able to knock the gun out of Lilliput's hands, so he sics his ants on the heroes instead. Launchpad is tackled to the ground, causing Darkwing to be launched from his beak onto Lilliput's helmet. He tries to destroy it so Lilliput can't communicate any more orders, but the villain throws him off and hits him with another dosage of shrinkage. Darkwing disappears from sight, becoming the size of a germ. Aggravated, Gosalyn and Honker grab cans of cola to get rid of the ants. Just as Lilliput is about to avenge his friends, he changes colors and starts sneezing uncontrollably. Honker theorizes that it might be a germ-sized Darkwing's way of attacking, so Gosalyn seizes the size gun and as Lilliput sneezes, she un-shrinks Darkwing along with a couple of germs he befriended, Blob and Ray. Lilliput takes the gun once more, but Darkwing easily retrieves it from the sick man.

Although the day is saved and all structures returned, things end on a sour note for Darkwing's team. It turns out he was contagious and now everyone, the two enlarged germs included, is sick. Drake takes solace in the fact he finally gets to have his sleep."

She tells him that she is in the semi-final video game playoff and continues to play. Drake unplugs the TV and tells her that she needs to go do her homework and that too many video games will ""rot her brain"". She breezes through her homework, although only halfway answering the questions and finds Drake playing the video game now. It seems that Drake is in the contest as well. Meanwhile Quackerjack shows up at a Whiffle Boy warehouse in a robotic gorilla and captures the two guards and proceeds to wreck the warehouse. One of the guards tells him that he can't stop Whiffle mania and that there is a contest at the local mall. Quackerjack decides that he will go there to stop the game once and for all and blows up the warehouse with his gorilla and leaving two stunned guards. At the mall, it is announced that Gosalyn has the lead and it's now Drake's turn at the game. Just as he is about to start the game, Quackerjack blows it up and Drake goes to find a closet to change into his Darkwing Duck disguise. Quackerjack tells Darkwing that he doesn't want to fight him and that his beef is with Whiffle Boy since Whiffle Boy products put him out of business. Darkwing is determined to stop him, but after a brief battle, Quackerjack gets away. The Whiffle Boy people invite Darkwing to compete with the champion in a Whiffle Boy playoff and Darkwing agrees. The champion he has to face is Gosalyn. They are flown to Whiffle Town to compete. As they tour Whiffle Town, Quackerjack shows up in a giant Crying Crissy Doll and uses it to start flooding Whiffle Town. Darkwing tries to stop it and fails. Gosalyn recognizes the doll and knows it's weakness. She hops on a surfboard and swims around it quickly causing the giant doll to spin it's head quickly to keep up with her. The head pops off with Quackerjack and floats out of town. Darkwing and Gosalyn now face off in the challenge and Pat and Pat show off the digitizer and digitize a Whiffle Boy character onto the game. Quackerjack shows up and in the mayhem, he and Darkwing get digitized into the game. Weasel Kid shows up and begins to chase Darkwing. Whiffle Boy appears, but since no one is controlling him, he does nothing and gets zapped leaving only two lives left for him. Quackerjack teams up with Weasel Kid since they both hate Whiffle Boy. Darkwing takes off. Whiffle Boy appears again and Gosalyn takes control of him. They complete several levels and make it to the Ultimal Level with Whiffle Boy only having one life left. Quackerjack shows up with Weasel Kid's giant robotic dad and they zap Whiffle Boy leaving Darkwing on his on in a level that he has never played. They chase Darkwing through the level and Darkwing falls on a train track activating a locomotive tank. The tank charges toward him and Darkwing fakes being injured to lure Weasel Dad and Quackerjack down on the track. Darkwing jumps away and Weasel Dad gets hit. Quackerjack recovers and chases Darkwing. Darkwing finds the exit to the level and also finds out that it is guarded by Gator Gal. He jumps off of Gator Gal to make it to the exit and re-appears outside of the game. Quackerjack tries to follow, but gets eaten by Gator Gal. Darkwing and Gosalyn agree to never let anything come between them again - until they are awarded the trophy and they start to fight over it."

Darkwing provides solid evidence that Tuskernini did the crime and Tukernini says that he is innocent and that he was framed. The judge finds Tuskernini guilty, but Tuskernini insists that he was framed by Darkwing. This causes a brief scuffle in the courtroom and the next scene shows Drake at home with a large knot on his head under an ice pack. Herb Muddlefoot comes over and Drake buys all his tupperware to get rid of him. Then Binkie Muddlefoot comes over and Drake signs up for her program to get rid of her. Just as Drake is relaxing again, the doorbell rings and it's both of the Muddlefoots. It seems that they have volunteered for an adopt-a-con program and Drake signed up for it to get rid of Binkie. Drake panics and tries to block the door. Someone else knocks and Launchpad opens the door to greet the judge from the trial of Tuskernini. It seems that Drake has been chosen to care for Tuskernini until he is reformed. Drake is convinced that Tuskernini is going to try something. A little later, Tuskernini's hench-penguins come in carrying instrument cases and Drake wants to see what is inside. They open up and Drake sees that there are actual instruments inside. Tuskernini goes up to his room with the penguins and they dig a tunnel through the closet floor. Drake knocks on the door and asks what all the noise is and Tuskernini tells him that they are just practicing. Drake goes outside and tries to see inside the window by jumping up and accidentally hits a power line. Tuskernini uses the tunnel to get out and the penguins put on some music and make shadows to look like Tuskernini is with them and they are practicing. Drake uses a rope and hook to get to the window and sees the shadows and thinks that Tuskernini is in the room. Drake crashes to the ground and Launchpad comes and tells him that he just heard that Megavolt is robbing a bank downtown. Tuskernini thinks that no one will be able to see through his Megavolt disguise as he is robbing the bank and Darkwing shows up and sees that it is Tuskernini in a really bad Megavolt disguise. Darkwing shoots a gas cartridge at him and Tuskernini sucks it up with a handheld vacuum cleaner. Darkwing grabs it and it blows up and allows Tuskernini to get away. Darkwing thinks that he has Tuskernini outsmarted and gets home and alerts the judge. The judge shows up and they open the door to find Tuskernini there in the room. He tells the judge that Darkwing is trying to frame him and Darkwing gets mad and jumps on him. The judge pulls Darkwing off and Tuskernini tries to play to the judge's sympathy. The judge takes Darkwing away to put him in jail and Tuskernini tells his hench-penguins that they now have the perfect cover to commit crimes. After a few hilarious scenes where Darkwing tries to break out only to find that Launchpad has been able to pay the fine and then the judge raises the fine each time and puts Darkwing back in jail, Launchpad pays the judge in time and the judge lets Darkwing go. Drake has a plan to trap Tuskernini at his own game. Drake, Launchpad and Gosalyn act like they are a criminal gang and they are going to rob The Mint and steal a ""zillion dollars"". This, of course, is something that Tuskernini can't resist. Drake tells Gosalyn and Launchpad the plan on how they are going to set Tuskernini (who is dressed up as Bushroot) up, but they accidentally botch it. Tuskernini gets mad and pulls out a bazooka. Gosalyn tells Tuskernini that it was Darkwing Duck that set them up and Tuskernini takes the three of them hostage and tells the police that he is Bushroot and to get Darkwing Duck or he will ""do in"" his hostages. Drake slips out of his ropes and tells Gosalyn and Launchpad to cover for him. Drake has to cross some obstacles before he is able to get to the front of the bank and changes into his Darkwing disguise. He offers to trade himself for the hostages and the judge shows up and demands that ""Bushroot"" show the hostages. Darkwing now goes around the obstacles again and gets inside the bank. He changes out of the disguise and slips back into the ropes and chair. ""Bushroot"" shows the hostages and after that Drake leaves once again and gets to the front of the bank. He insists that he goes in first and the judge follows him. Darkwing shows up and ""Bushroot"" releases the hostages, not knowing that the shrub that Launchpad grabs doesn't have Drake in it anymore. Tuskernini fires the bazooka backwards by mistake and opens the tunnel back up. He makes a run for the tunnel and Darkwing follows him with the judge in pursuit. They get to Tuskernini's room and the judge realizes that Bushroot was actually Tuskernini in disguise and he takes him back to jail. Drake reads the paper and Tuskernini's arrest is on the front page. Herb Muddlefoot comes over and shows Drake that he has reformed the con that he and Binkie adopted and now the con is a tupperware salesman."

The real Darkwing is rescuing a kitty out of a tree and sees a mob approaching. He realizes that they are an angry mob after him and runs. He sees a program on television and sees a report about how he has changed from do-gooder to evil villain. The mayor has offered a reward of a million dollars. Darkwing barely escapes the mob and goes to S.H.U.S.H. headquarters. Agent Grizlikoff jumps on Darkwing planning on collecting the million dollar reward when J. Gander Hooter tells him that he knows that Darkwing is innocent. They go to the lab and see Dr. Sarah Bellum. She uses a machine that is supposed to alter Darkwing's appearance, but it does not cause him to change at first. Then suddenly he turns into a Grizlikoff look-a-like then a Dr. Bellum look-a-like. It only happens when Darkwing looks at someone and he changes into that person. Dr. Bellum tries to use the machine on Darkwing to change him back but it malfunctions. Darkwing is determined to prove his innocence and heads to the police station on the motorcycle. Gosalyn and Launchpad are riding with him and he has to stop suddenly to keep from hitting a dog. They land in the bushes and Gosalyn and Launchpad see the dog with Darkwing's hat on and think that it is him and chase ofter it. Darkwing comes to and wonders why they are chasing the dog.

Darkwing finds Negaduck and Negaduck grabs him. Darkwing sees a baby and changes into a baby. Negaduck thinks he can turn in the baby Darkwing and collect the reward when a crowd shows up. They think that Negaduck is Darkwing in disguise and jump on him. Baby Darkwing lands in the baby's stroller and changes back. Darkwing finds his motorcycle and goes searching for Negaduck and finds him. They fight on the motorcycle and Darkwing changes into a cello player that he sees as they are speeding along. Negaduck wonders how he is doing that and they go flying off an unfinished bridge.

Meanwhile, Gosalyn and Launchpad have caught the dog and brought it back to Darkwing's secret hideout. Darkwing returns and asks them what is going on. Gosalyn and Launchpad now know that Darkwing is not the dog. Darkwing changes into Gosalyn and then Launchpad. Gosalyn asks for her dad back and Darkwing as Launchpad says he will find him and takes off in the Thunderquack jet. He changes back into Darkwing and crashes the jet onto Negaduck. Darkwing gets back to the hideout in a shambles and thinks that he should give up. Gosalyn tells him not to give up and that maybe he should think like Negaduck to find him and capture him. Darkwing thinks it's a great idea and stares at a picture of Negaduck and turns into him. Unfortunately, this kinda backfires and Darkwing starts acting like Negaduck and destroys some things and then goes after Gosalyn and Launchpad. They are able to escape and then get Dr. Bellum and follow him to Negaduck's hideout.

Both of them get into a sort of race of arms and Gosalyn, Launchpad, and Dr. Bellum come in. Dr. Bellum hits both of them with the ray and Darkwing turns back into himself and Negaduck turns into a canned fish mascot. Negaduck flops away and Darkwing chases him. Mayhem in sues as they both change into a lobster and a sailor. Darkwing changes into Gosalyn and hits a can with a paddle knocking out Negaduck. The police show up after Darkwing is hit with the ray and turns back into himself for good. Darkwing shows them that Negaduck was behind all the crimes and they arrest Negaduck. Darkwing takes the ray gun and starts to walk off with it to dispose of it.
