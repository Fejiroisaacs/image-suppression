A gambling chip belonging to the latest agent to disappear leads Jim to a casino where the beautiful Crystal (Janine Gray) runs the roulette wheel. Crystal seems to have information about the missing agent but is shot and can only gasp the name ""Coffin"" before she dies. Jim and Artemus then encounter the seductive Jennifer Wingate (Diane McBain) who's taking a bath in the men's bathroom at their hotel. Unbeknowst to them, Jennifer has been hired to kill Jim by the villainous Capt. Coffin (Jeff Corey) -- a former riverboat pilot blinded 11 years ago in an explosion but rescued by the Oriental beauty Oriana (Linda Ho) who is now his devoted companion. While entertaining Jim at a romantic dinner-for-two, Jennifer shoots him but he's saved by his bullet-proof vest. Jennifer then reveals her connection to Coffin, saying she passes on to him information about riverboat traffic. Jim accompanies Jennifer to a nearby grotto where he's captured by Coffin and his henchmen. Jim winds up shirtless, tied to a ladder inside Coffin's headquarters. Coffin explains that he plans to demand one penny in tribute for every pound of cargo carried on the Mississippi, thus making him the richest man in the world. Next, Coffin has Jim, still bare-chested, locked in a suspended cage attached to a lightning rod. The lightning storm raging outside will soon result in Jim's electrocution. Jim manages to escape from the cage, however, but as he runs off in pursuit of Coffin, he trips a wire and is temporarily blinded by a powder-flash. He manages to find Coffin and the two men blindly go after each other in a sword fight. Coffin then throws a bladed weapon, hoping to kill Jim but accidentally killing the devoted Oriana. More struggles follow and Jim, his vision restored, manages to drop the suspended cage on Coffin just as the charge from a lightning bolt surges through it. Back in their private train-car, Jim and Artemus are kissed by the still-seductive Jennifer Wingate who persuades them to speak for leniency when she goes before a judge."

Gilbert. The man tries the door and finds it locked, and breaks through with one punch. The owner, Gilbert, stares at the man, Torres, who says that Gilbert is in an odd business for a retired Army colonel. Gilbert stares at Torres' partially metal-plated face and asks who he is, and Torres admits that it's difficult to recognize him now and says that he was a presentable young man. The owner finally recognizes Torres and is surprised that he recovered. Torres says that he is now a superior man, plated with iron and with iron cords for sinews. He says that the others made him as he is, and Gilbert swears that he has no idea what Torres is talking about.

Torres asks why Gilbert is hiding, and Gilbert says that he earns his living there. He asks what Torres wants, and Torres says that he wants the small thing of Gilbert's life. Gilbert grabs a pike and asks how he harmed Torres, and says that five of the officers dying in their cadre was a coincidence. He stabs Torres but the pike shatters on Torres' metal-plated chest. Torres chokes Gilbert to death, and tells him that that he now has his gratitude.

Jim comes in and sees Torres, who advises him to leave. The agent attacks Torres but his blows bounce off of Torres' body. Jim draws his revolver but the bullets have no effect. Torres reaches for Jim, who uses a smoke pellet hidden in the butt of his revolver to drive Torres out. Jim goes after him but Torres disappears into the fog.

A week later at the Wanderer, Jim and Artie gets a Morse code message that President Grant wants to know what progress they've made finding Gilbert's killer. Jim wonders why would anyone would want to kill Gilbert, and Artie's contacts have only tracked down Gilbert's niece Nina to a school somewhere out East. She's the only lead the agents have. Another message comes in saying that Nina has left school, and they figure that Nina is heading to the shop.

The agents go to the shop and find Nina there. They introduce themselves and she asks what they've discovered, and they admit they haven't found the killer yet. Nina suggests that Gilbert was the target of an assassination plot, and she has a photograph of the eight junior officers in her uncle's regiment. Six of them have violently died in the last year, and Gilbert sent her the picture and a letter saying he feared he would be next. Grant is in the photograph, and Army Intelligence received a similar letter from Gilbert. Nina insists on finding her uncle's killer, and Jim says that they've discovered that the regiment's doctor, Meyer, is practicing in the city and he would have intimate knowledge of the cadre, that wouldn't appear in the dossiers. Nina has identified one of the men in the photo as Lt. Torres, and she's heading to his villa on the Texas border.

Nina goes to Torres' villa and knocks at the door. Torres tells Maria, the old woman who answers the door, to let Nina in. Jim confronts the driver as he's leaving despite Nina's orders to wait, and the agent draws his gun on him and confirms where the man took Nina. When Jim turns his back, the driver draws a knife, but Jim senses the attack, turns, and shoots the driver, then rides to the villa.

Artie meets with Meyer, who says that Torres was self-taught and designed the operations that Meyer conducted on him. Meyer says that Torres should have died in the explosion, or in the succeeding operations. According to Meyer's dossier, Torres was on guard duty the night of the explosion. Meyer says that Torres was in agony for many years afterward, and sedation or anesthesia had any effect on him because of the nature of his injuries. Torres learned autohypnosis to suppress the pain, and Meyer performed the operation on Torres while he was conscious. Meyer confirms that half of Torres' bones are now metal.

Torres confronts Nina, and comments on her lack of reaction to his partially metal-plated face. She says that she has done her postgraduate work in psychophysics, and doesn't find it a dreary subject. Nina asks if Torres recalls her uncle. He says that he does and offers his condolences, and Nina says that she doesn't believe the death of the other six men was a coincidence. Torres talk about how charming is, and asks her to describe regression while he spins the light from a lamp into her face. He hypnotizes her with the lamp and tells Nina that she will gratify every wish and whim, and never waste a moment on serious thought, and tells her to laugh as a child. She busts into laughter,

Jim breaks into the cellar, setting off a hidden alarm that warns Torres. He leads Nina off, while Maria confronts Jim and says that Nina and Torres are both gone. Two thugs attack Jim and he fights back, knocking them out. Maria invites Jim to look, and he draws a gun and tells him to tell him where Torres took Nina.

In the town of Alto Nuevo, the townspeople are preparing for Grant's arrival. Jim rides in and finds Artie talking to a woman. He draws his partner inside, and Artie says that Grant won't call off his tour plans because a ""crackpot"" is threatening his lie. Jim figures they have to find Torres because his plan might always be in motion. Jim spots Torres in a saloon's second-story window and points him out to Artie.

The two agents go into the saloon and buy drinks. Torres' aide Lopez asks Torres if he should take Nina to the cellar, and Torres tells Lopez to begin the entertainment early. The saloon girls begin swinging on swings above the patrons, throwing flowers, and the agents realize that one of them is Nina. Jim realizes that something is wrong with her, and Torres is playing games with them. While Jim carries Nina out, Artie tells the crowd that Jim is Nina's daughter and has been looking for her for years. Torres has Lopez take men to stop Jim, while Artie buys drinks for everyone to toast American fatherhood.

Jim takes Nina out in the alleyway, and she doesn't remember him. He figures that she's been hypnotized, and men attack him. Jim defeats them and runs into a nearby door

In the saloon, Lopez confronts Artie and tells him to go upstairs, with a hidden gun as additional persuasion. Artie has no choice but to go, to the upstairs room, and Torres seemingly hypnotizes Artie into believing they don't have enough proof to act. He tells Jim that when he returns to the Wanderer, he'll tell Jim that he's been exploring the dungeons beneath the saloon, and they should explore them. As Artie goes, Torres jabs a needle into Artie's shoulder, figuring he'll be insensate to pain. Artie doesn't react and Torres tells him to go.

At the Wanderer, Jim tells Artie that Nina disappeared during the fight. Artie explains that he faked immunity to the pain, and figures they should let themselves be caught. They go back to the saloon and enter the dungeons, break in, and hear running water. Torres and Lopez are there, and Torres says that it's an underwater river. Torres knocks out Jim and Lopez takes Artie down at gunpoint. He then chains up the two agents.

Later, Nina brings them drink and says that Torres doesn't know she's there. She gives them sips but says that Torres wouldn't like her helping them. Jim convinces her to take a pencil out of his lapel. They kiss, and Jim has her use the pencil's blowtorch feature to free him. Lopez is sleeping and wakes up when hears the explosions, and then the agents run through the tunnels with Nina but come to a dead end with a pool in the floor. Torres pumps in knock out gas to render them unconscious. Artie falls into the water and sinks out of sight, while Torres watches them through the window in a closed door.

That night, Torres strings Jim up in his saloon apartment behind a window, as Artie disguised as the President arrives in town. Torres aims two outside wireless rockets, one at ""Grant"", and one at the apartment, from a panel in the apartment. Torres says that he and the other men drew cards to stand guard that night, and insists that the other soldiers cheated. He explains that he plans to use one rocket to kill Grant and one to kill Jim. The people in the crowd set off fireworks, and Torres triggers the fuse on Grant rocket, tells Lope that there will be a one-minute delay, and Lopez should wait until the first rocket goes off and then join Torres in the tunnels.

Once Torres leaves, Jim tells Lopez that Torres is setting him up to eliminate any witnesses. Lopez finally panics and runs, and Jim swings himself over and kicks the control panel, knocking the Grant rocket off-course. The second rocket fires one minute early, as Torres planned, and Jim pulls himself up out of the way and lets the explosion bring down the rafter and free him. Artie sees the explosions, and watches as the off-course Grant rocket enters the apartment and finishes freeing Jim.

Lopez goes to the dungeons and confronts Torres. Torres has heard both explosions in the building, and realizes Grant still lives. He kills Lopez and then goes to the dead end. Jim is waiting behind the closed door. He closes the door but Torres forces it open with his superior strength. Torres refuses to flee and attacks Jim, who manages to throw Torres into the water. The former army man is too heavy to pull himself, refuses to take Jim's hand, and lets himself drown rather than face the indignity of hanging for his crimes. Artie runs in and removes his Grant disguise, and says that there's a tunnel leading to the river.

The next day, Grant arrives and gives his speech. Artie takes Torres' lamp to the Wanderer, and undoes Nina's hypnotism while Jim watches. She sees herself in the saloon girl outfit and assumes the agent took advantage of her, slaps Jim, and throws pillows and books at them in a fury. Jim throws things back as the Wanderer leaves."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0748513/?ref_=ttep_ep26,,Jim and Arte investigate the disappearance of the Kara diamond. They discover a sinister plot by Morgan Midas to use the stone to create an invisibility potion.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Irving J. Moore'],"['', '']",[],"['man tied up', 'potion', 'invisibility', 'diamond', 'false accusation', 'fratricide', 'pool table', 'jail', 'investigation', 'hung upside down', 'falling down stairs', 'cat']",[],"At the Serbian Consulate, Jim arrives as a representative of the U.S. government and meets with the Serbian minister. Jim says that they share a matter of great importance, and the minister leads him to his office. The agent talks about the international jewel exhibit and how the U.S. government wants to take special measures to safeguard the Serbians' Kara diamond. The minister believes his own safety measures are adequate, and Jim points out there have been several mysterious diamond thefts in recent weeks. Jim says that the U.S. wants to take the diamond into protective custody. He points out all of the consulate's security measures, and the minister congratulates him and says that Jim could have been cut down immediately, and the room is the perfect place to secure the diamond.

The minister shows Jim the diamond, beneath a flip-top table, and says that the diamond is perfectly protected Jim points that all of the jewels have been taken from ""perfectly"" secured places, and the minister says that the door is locked and the outside hallway is patrolled 24/7. The minister points out the high fences outside the window. The door opens with no on present, the case the diamond is in shatters, the diamond itself disappears, and a newspaper with a headline about diamond thieves baffling the authorities appears. The minister figures Jim took the diamond as a demonstration and tells him to give it back. Jim says that he wasn't responsible, but the minister doesn't believe him and calls for his guards. Jim tells the minister that he'll find the diamond under a nearby bust, then fights his way past the guards, and uses the cane he's carrying to shoot blinding smoke. He then jumps out a window and makes his escape.

Later, Morgan Midas and his manservant Clive are taking a crate out of Midas's manor to his carriage. They secure it on the back and then drive off. Another carriage returns and Artie emerges and knocks at the front door. Another manservant, Rudd, answers, and Artie asks if Lady Margaret Midas is there. Rudd doesn't respond, and Lucretia Ivronin arrives and dismisses Rudd. She says that Lady Margaret has departed, and won't be home for some time. Artie says that Margaret asked for government protection for her rare diamond she was going to donate to the international jewel show, and asks who Lucretia is. She slams the door in his face.

Later at the Wanderer, Artie points out that no one has seen the thief, only diamonds are taken, and there are signs of some tremendous force. He suggests that the diamonds are being made to explode from within, but doesn't believe it himself. Thaddeus Baines, a special envoy from Washington, arrives at the door and demands to see Jim. Baines tells Jim that he has created an international incident, and explains that he's charged with seeing that the exhibit reflects well on their government. Jim says that what happened at the consulate matches the pattern of the other thefts, and there was nothing he could have done to stop the robbery. Artie presents his theory, and Baines doesn't believe it, and almost sets off one of the exploding billiard balls inside of the train car.

Later, James goes to the Midas manor to see Lady Margaret. Clive lets him in and goes to announce Jim's presence, and Morgan and Lucretia come to see the agent. Morgan says that his aunt recently departed on a long voyage, and introduces Lucretia as his fiancé. The younger man says that Lady Margaret went to Germany for the mineral waters, for her gout. Jim reminds them of Margaret's promise to show her diamonds at the exhibition, and Morgan says that she never mentioned. Lucretia apologizes for her treatment of Artie earlier, and Morgan refuses to let the diamonds leave the house without his aunt's consent. Jim has a letter to Baines that Margaret wrote to him, and says that he'll open the safe the diamonds are in when Morgan says that he doesn't know the combination.

Lucretia takes Jim to the safe, while Morgan excuses himself. The safe is in the main room, and Jim easily opens it. There are no diamonds inside, and Jim isn't surprised. He tells Lucretia that she and Morgan have to come with him, and she kisses. An invisible force knocks Jim out, and Morgan appears out of nowhere and looks down at the unconscious Jim.

Artie and Baines are at the exhibit, and Artie show Baines the security precautions he's installed, including a flash camera and a high speed cage around the main diamond. The entrance has pressure plates that will seal the doors with barred grates. Baines asks for Jim is, and Artie assures the envoy that wherever Jim is, he's all right.

Jim is hanging upside down in Morgan's lab, with electricity rigged through the hanging bar. Morgan figures that Jim knows what he's doing and that's why he came. The man is heating a diamond to 4,000 degrees, and Morgan feeds electricity through the bars and demands Jim tell him the truth. Jim insists that he doesn't know anything about Morgan's work, and feigns amnesia from the current. Morgan gives him more electricity to wipe his memory, and Lucretia comes in and objects to Morgan hurting Jim. Morgan tells Lucretia to watch over Jim and leaves.

Artie arrives at the front door disguised as an elderly German count, and Clive lets him in. He demands to see Margaret. Morgan comes down from his lab and says Margaret isn't at home, and Artie says that he told the lady he was coming so she wouldn't have left. The agent says that they will wait, and says that they've corresponded. Morgan excuses himself, and once Artie is alone, he searches the place.

Morgan goes back to his lab and tells Lucretia to go down and get rid of Artie. Jim is feigning unconsciousness, and Lucretia leaves. The agent pulls himself up, gets a knife from his boot, and starts cutting himself free.

Lucretia pours brandy for Artie and says that Margaret won't be coming for some time.

Morgan sees Jim cutting himself free, and goes to attack him. Artie hears the commotion and starts to go up to the lab, and Lucretia calls Clive and Rudd to stop him. The agent fights his way past the, while Jim punches Morgan, who runs down the stairs. Clive attacks Jim, and Morgan runs back to his lab. The agents defeat their opponents, and the agents head upstairs. Artie is knocked out by the same invisible force, and Morgan appears next to Jim. Jim throws a punch at him, but Morgan disappears and then the force knocks out Jim.

Jim and Artie are tied to chairs, back to back. Lucretia brings them water and helps them drink, and she tells them that Morgan hit them, and he was moving too fast to be seen. He distills an elixir from the diamonds, which lets him move too fast to be seen. Lucretia has aligned herself with Morgan so he can give her whatever she wants, because he's invulnerable. She advises Jim to stop fighting Morgan because he can't beat him. Lucretia admits that she likes Jim, but won't go up against Morgan. She kisses Jim and leaves.

Morgan and Lucretia go to the diamond show to check out which diamonds he'll steal next, giving him enough money to set up an organization that will make him totally invincible. They go back to the manor and Morgan offers the agents unlimited power because he's impressed with their skill and daring. Morgan wants Artie to help him avoid the traps, and he'll probably kill them or destroy their minds with electricity and set them loose. Jim agrees, and Morgan figures they're playing with him, but he'll give them a taste of the diamond elixir so they can get a taste of the power he can offer.

As they take a carriage to the hall, Morgan manacles the agents and trains a gun on him. Once they arrive, Morgan gives them sips of the elixir while he takes twice as much. They accelerate and go in, and everyone around them is seemingly motionless because they're moving so fast. Morgan puts the gun away, saying that it's now useless, and drops the flask where it seemingly hangs in midair.

In the hall, Morgan tells them not to remain motionless for too long or they might be sound. They go into the main hall, and Morgan warns that if they move too fast, air fraction will set them on fire. Morgan puts a knife to Jim's nest and tells Artie to describe the security measures. He removes the case from the main diamond, letting the case float off. As they leave, Jim and Artie wince in pain as the elixir wears off. Morgan walks out, and they slow down to near-immobility. The crook plants some of the diamonds on Jim, then walks off out at superspeed as the grates slam down on either side of the agents, trapping them. Baines says that they'll pay for it, and finds the diamonds on Jim.

Jim and Artie escape and go to the Midas manor. They find an open window on the back, but all the first-story doors and windows are locked. The agents rig a seesaw out of a flower bucket and a board, and Artie jumps on one end, propelling Jim on the other end up to the open window. Jim goes inside and lets Artie in through the kitchen. He tells Artie to make a racket to lure Clive and Rudd in, and then deal with them while Jim deals with Morgan. Artie bangs on a pot, luring Clive and Rudd in, while Morgan distills one drop of the elixir while Lucretia looks on.

When the manservants run in to investigate the commotion, Artie knocks them out with a frying pan.

Jim barges into the lab and punches Morgan. Lucretia grabs Morgan's gun but can't bring herself to shoot Jim. Morgan drinks the elixir from his flask, and Jim runs over, grabs it, and drinks the remainder. Morgan points out that he took more, and he'll finish off Lucretia later. Lucretia throws Jim the gun, but it seemingly freezes in midair as Jim and Morgan accelerate. The two men brawl, and Jim feels the pain as the elixir starts to wear off on him. Jim manages to knock Morgan into a lab table, knocking alcohol on him. Jim slows down to normal speed, and the alcohol ignites from Morgan's body friction, burning him to ash in seconds. Jim tells Lucretia what happened to Morgan

Jim goes back to the kitchen and finds Artie standing next to the tied-up manservants. Artie claims that he ""cheated"" by using force."

Elizabeth Jennings is getting some inside info from a member of the Department of Justice. That night, as she's removing his clothes in bed, he continues telling her about ""the sheer number of people dedicated to destroying our way of life"" while she pleasures him. We next see her leaving, removing her blond wig and driving away.

Three days later, we see Philip Jennings and another man waiting to execute a hit. Elizabeth pays a man for a few moments worth of looking out his window. Philip waits for Elizabeth's signal from the window. He waits for the man to approach. The man pauses before reaching the spot where Philip is waiting, then runs away. Philip and his accomplice give chase, with Philip identifying himself as ""immigration."" Philip and his accomplice follow the man into an alley, where the man ducks in for a moment and stabs Philip's cohort in the stomach before continuing to flee.

Philip catches up to the man, who pulls a blade on him. After a brief fight, the man tells Philip he knows he's not supposed to be killed, but Philip tells the man he has no idea how badly he's wanted. ""I could deliver you in a hundred pieces and get a medal for each one."" Philip secures the man and Elizabeth drives up in a car waiting to take the man away. The man shouts for help while being pushed into the car as Philip acts like he's a cop and gives the man his Miranda rights. Philip hops into the driver's seat and takes off. He stops in an alley to change the license plates on the car and drives away again.

Philip and Elizabeth drop their colleague off near a hospital for treatment, instructing him to identify himself as a John Doe and walk to the hospital from the drop-off spot. Philip and Elizabeth drive off with their captor asking the to consider his offer to help. Philip droves up to a dock and they watch a cargo ship sail away. Philip turns and asks, ""Why is everyone so punctual in this business?""

At FBI headquarters, a couple of agents are heading to a meeting and waiting for the arrival of ""Timoshev,"" an ex-KGB colonel who blew the whistle on some undercover agents ""supposedly"" hiding in the U.S., Agent Chris Amador tells his colleague. He's not convinced such agents exist, saying that men like Timoshev are paid millions to give up information. Timoshev has told the FBI that these agents aren't allowed to say a single word in Russian once they get to the States. ""Someone's been reading too many spy novels,"" Amador says.

We next see Philip Jennings untying his captor, who tells him the FBI paid him $3 million when he ""came off"" and more since, as a consultant. He tells Philip he can get twice that, and another $3 million for returning him. Philip pushes the man back into the trunk. We next see Philip and Elizabeth in their very normal looking American home in the morning, ushering their kids off to school. After the kids leave, Philip and Elizabeth talk about the man's $3 million claim, but Elizabeth says, ""He can buy himself a diamond-plated coffin.""

We next see Philip sitting on a park bench watching carefully at all the people around him. He sees police looking around for a suspect in some kind of robbery. Philip pulls something from his pocket and sticks it under the bench before walking away.

Back at their house, Elizabeth goes into the garage and pauses for a moment while catching her reflection in the back of the car window. She's taken back to the Soviet Union in 1960 where she's doing some boxing training. The captain arrives and takes over the training session. He tries a few of her fighting techniques on him, which he easily fends off. Eventually he gets her into a submissive hold on the ground, tears off her sweats and rapes her as her original trainer walks away.

Back in the garage in 1981, Elizabeth opens the trunk, looks inside and says, in a perfect American accent, ""Remember me, captain?"" She looks at him for a moment before slamming the trunk door back down.

It's another day in the Jennings house, where their daughter Paige is learning about ""how the Russians cheat on arms control."" Philip gets home and tells Elizabeth he made the drop at the park and got no response. Elizabeth suggests ""he can move in permanently"" and she can fix the spare bedroom for him.

Later, the family is out having ice cream and Elizabeth isn't in the mood to play. Philip talks about a client meeting he has later that night.

Later, we see him visit a woman named Martha. She calls him Clark. Philip speaks quickly about being a part of the Committee to Oversee United States Counterintelligence Agencies, and that their meeting is classified. Martha tells him about a man who was kidnapped. ""He was supposed to speak at a conference this morning, but he didn't show."" Philip asks if there was a ""centralized response"" to the kidnapping. Martha says she's not allowed into such meetings. She says the man who was kidnapped was Russian, and they had a vehicle description: A 1977 Oldsmobile, gold with D.C. plates and bumper stickers. The kidnappers were two men and a woman one of the men was ""average height with dark hair.""

That night, Philip goes through a hidden storage space behind a circuit box and plays a tape of Elizabeth's encounter with the man she met at the beginning of the episode. He listens to some of her sexual exploits with the man before he tells her about his plan to give $100,000 to a KGB defector. Philip stops the tape.

Philip reports back to Elizabeth about how the FBI is putting the pieces together about their kidnapping and the increased surveillance is likely the reason they aren't hearing back from their contacts. Elizabeth wants to kill the man because he'll just be killed back in Moscow anyway. She says the man is putting them all in danger. Philip suggests that they defect themselves and become millionaires, and ""a lot of our problems just go away."" Elizabeth isn't amused.

The next day, Philip and the kids are going to the mall. Elizabeth stays behind. At the mall, Philip embarrasses his daughter by trying on some cowboy boots and dancing along to a song playing in the store. Philip hears a man make a sexual suggestive comment to his daughter and decides not to handle the guy which we know full well he could.

Elizabeth, back at the house, takes a large knife from the kitchen and heads toward the garage. Philip and the kids get home. Philip notices the knife and Elizabeth asks, ""What, you think I killed him?"" Philip says he was ""just checking."" Philip kisses the back of Elizabeth's neck and she tells him to stop, eventually pulling the knife close to him. Philip reminds her that she's his wife, and Elizabeth says, ""Is that right?""

The Jennings' go over to welcome some new neighbors who've just moved in. They meet Agent Stan Beeman, who works for the FBI and tells them he works in counterintelligence. Philip jokes, ""I have to make sure I don't do any spying around here."" Agent Beeman tells him, ""Especially not for the Russians.""

""Oh, they're the worst, right?"" Philip says.

""They certainly are, Philip,"" Agent Beeman says. ""They certainly are.""

That night, Elizabeth tells Philip it's ""probably just a coincidence."" She says they need to get rid of Timoshev that night. Philip thinks that's the last thing they want to do. He thinks it could be an opportunity just be ""us."" He says they might be blown, and they ""are Philip and Elizabeth Jennings we have been for a long time."" He reminds her of the money they could get for Timoshev.

""Are you joking?"" she asks him. ""Is this a joke?""

Philip asks her what's so bad about America. She asks him what he'd tell their kids and he says ""the truth."" She slaps him. She says their kids would never forgive them. She says they wouldn't get away with it and asks him, ""Have you seen our trunk?"" Philip says that Timoshev was ""a fool"" and came back to give speeches and left clues about where he was staying. ""We'd be more careful,"" he tells her. She leaves.

The next day, Philip is out for a run and flashes back to Moscow, April 1962. He's looking at a picture of a woman, which he tears and throws in the trash when a colonel approaches. He's taken to a room, where he meets Elizabeth. They're left to ""get acquainted."" They're instructed to get to know each other and their new identities, knowing nothing of their actual identities. After his run, Philip calls the hospital to check on his colleague from the night of the kidnapping. He learns that the man ""expired"" that night.

When he gets home, Agent Beeman comes over and asks Philip for some jumper cables. Philip brings Agent Beeman into the garage, who notices the make and model of the car. Philip opens the trunk, instructs Timoshev to stay quiet, and retrieves the jumper cables. He hands them over. Agent Beeman says he has to go, and Philip leads him out.

Back at FBI headquarters, Agent Beeman meets a CIA agent about the kidnapping of Timoshev. Beeman says that if Russians kidnapped Timoshev they'd probably want to just stay close to their own house.

That night, Philip makes it through a school function with his son, where an American astronaut is on hand and the national anthem is played in all its glory. Later, Philip pulls Timoshev from the trunk and tells Elizabeth he's taking Timoshev to make a deal. She tells him she's a KGB officer and would die and lose everything before betraying her country. She decides to finish things herself. Elizabeth beats Timoshev so hard, at one point she kicks his head through the garage's drywall. She picks up a crowbar and Timoshev tells Elizabeth he's sorry and never meant to hurt her. ""They let us have our way with the cadets. It was part of the job a perk,"" he says.

Philip asks what he's talking about and how Timoshev hurt her. Elizabeth drops the crowbar and says nothing but ""do what you want with him, take him to the Americans if that's what you want.""

As she's walking away, Philip grabs Timoshev, pushes him up against the wall and chokes him until he dies. He lets Timoshev's body fall, then turns to look at Elizabeth, who looks at him and says nothing.

We next see Philip and Elizabeth driving in silence with the exception of Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" playing in the background. They're driving in the Oldsmobile. We next see them pouring acid on Timoshev's body before sealing him in a bag and tossing him into some water. They get back into the car and look at each other. Saying nothing, Elizabeth climbs across the car and kisses Philip. They proceed to do more than kiss, right there in the car.

The next morning, Philip and Elizabeth are helping conceal each other's wounds and bruises. They eat breakfast with their kids when the phone rings. Elizabeth answers and looks stunned. Not saying anything, she looks at Philip.

Agent Beeman sees Philip taking his son Henry to hockey practice. Beeman notices Philip's band-aids on his neck and Philip says it's just a shaving incident. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is cleaning out the trunk of the Olds.

Back at his house, Beeman tells his wife he likes Philip, but wonders if there's something a little off about him. She teases him and tells him he's back in the real world with regular, boring people.

Philip winds up in the backyard of Errol, the man who'd hit on Philip's 13-year-old daughter at the store earlier. This doesn't end well for Errol, who winds up severely beaten and with the wrong end of a barbecue fork stuck through his hand.

Elizabeth gets around to telling Philip some of her real backstory: Her father died fighting Nazis.

That night, a curious Agent Beeman breaks into the Jennings' garage and snoops around for clues, examining the car and even opening its trunk. Seeing nothing amiss, Beeman shakes his head and opens the garage just enough to make his way out. Meanwhile, we see, Philip has been standing there watching and holding a gun, but never even making so much of a move for Beeman to even have known he was there."

Phillip is having thoughts about defecting to America for the right price. Elizabeth is outraged. They've kidnapped a Russian defector a former captain who raped Elizabeth during her training back in the mother land. Phillip didn't know how the captain hurt Elizabeth, but when she told him to do with the captain what he wants, Phillip killed him by crushing his throat.

'The Clock': We open on Phillip in bed with a woman who calls him Scott. We later see Phillip telling Elizabeth that ""she"" (presumably the woman) ""isn't cut out for this."" Elizabeth tells Phillip that the woman is good at getting men to turn their brains off, which has collapsed whole empires. She says the fact that the woman cares about ""Swedish intelligence officer"" Scott Berkman (Phillip's cover) is enough. Phillip says he isn't so sure she cares about ""him,"" either.

We next see the woman at a dinner party with her husband, where a bunch of guys are talking about various missiles. She sneaks off to snoop around the study and snaps some photos from a camera hidden in her bra. Security guards catch her and take her to another room.

Meanwhile, Phillip prepares to go meet the woman hoping she completed her task. He gets to a hotel room and finds her there, excited to tell him about being questioned by the guards. She tells him she played her part perfectly. She tells ""Scott"" that she thinks he's ""the one,"" and she loves him. He tells her he loves her, too. They have sex again.

Phillip develops the photos in a dark room while Elizabeth talks to him about ""Reagan ranting and raving"" and how he ""literally wants to destroy us."" They see a clock among the items in the study and focus on it. The plan will be to get someone on the inside, which could take ""six, seven months,"" according to Phillip, and they'll take it for a day, or so, to see what they can get from it before putting it back. Elizabeth notices a picture of the woman in her bra and says, ""You never told me she looked like that. Phillip stammers a little, and then says, ""well, she's not always dressed like that.""

Agent Beeman and Agent Amador are watching a woman walk into an electronics store. She walks out quickly with a wrapped box. Beeman gets out to question the man in the store about the woman who was in there. The man says he can't tell them ""a damn thing."" They start poking around behind the counter and find a tin with Russian writing on it. It's caviar, ""very fancy stuff,"" Amador says. They take it despite the store clerk's objections.

At the Soviet Embassy, plans are discussed in Russian about a visit by British Prime Minister Thatcher and Defense Minister Nott, who will be meeting Secretary of Defense Weinberger at his house. The two men Arkady and Vasili disagree on the best way to execute the mission. Arkady reminds Vasili that he (Arkady) reports to General Zhukov, an old friend of Vasili's. Vasili says he'll cable Zhukov right away, but Arkady warns him that ""Zhukov isn't who he used to be."" And adds, ""Be careful. I tell you as a friend,"" before walking out.

Phillip and Elizabeth get their orders in a coded message. Phillip thinks this mission, which is supposed to take place in three days, should take six months to plan. Elizabeth reminds him that ""these are orders"" and ""it must be necessary."" She says they can make adjustments as they go. Phillip thinks it's ""crazy.""

Elizabeth sits at a bench watching a man walk across what looks like a college campus. She walks toward him, holding an umbrella. She releases a sharp end from its point and, as she gets close to the man, trips on purpose apparently sticking him on the foot with the sharp end. He sees her and forgives her for the ""accidental"" fall, helps her pick up her books and keeps walking.

Back at home, Phillip rounds the kids up for dinner and asks Elizabeth if she finished up the Kryzinski package. She says yes. She then notices her 13-year-old daughter is wearing a red bra and doesn't seem to like it.

Phillip and Elizabeth show up at a woman's house in disguise, saying only that they ""need to talk"" about her son. Phillip abruptly walks in, with the woman trailing him and Elizabeth closing the door behind them. Phillip calls the woman by her name, Viola. Phillip explains to her that her son has been poisoned and he (Phillip) has the antidote. He will let Grayson, her son, die in 72 hours if she doesn't complete one task: She has to go into her boss' study and take the clock from the bookshelf.

That night, Phillip worries that Viola won't make a great target, but Elizabeth assures him that the fact that Viola believed him was all that matters. Phillip is also annoyed that Agent Beeman doesn't appear to be back home yet. He wishes he knew Beeman's schedule in order to avoid too many late-night run ins. Elizabeth is worried that Beeman is still suspicious of them, but Phillip tells her Beeman's face when he saw their trunk was clean made it clear that he felt silly for having suspected anything in the first place. Phillip tells her Beeman is no fool, but ""I think he's moved on.""

Elizabeth starts thinking about her kids. She thinks Henry, their younger son, would ""adjust"" if anything happened to them. But she worries about Paige, saying ""she's delicate somehow."" She turns off the light and goes to sleep.

The next day, Viola is in her boss' study and sees the clock. She moves toward it and the woman of the house walks in and asks Viola if she's ""seen Caspar's datebook."" Viola says it's in the dining room.

""That man,"" Weinberger's wife says. ""God help us if we ever go to war.""

Mrs. Weinberger notices that Viola looks tired. Viola says she worries about her son, and they talk briefly about how they ""almost lost"" him. But he made it through this vague episode ""thanks to you and Mr. Weinberger,"" Viola says. Mrs. Weinberger leaves the study and Viola turns and looks at the clock again.

At the travel agency, Elizabeth tells Phillip that Grayson looked bad that day and Viola almost lost it when she saw him. She tells Phillip they need to cover their meets as best they can, and she doesn't think he should go alone. He says they're ""sitting ducks, either way."" He hugs Elizabeth and feels a gun she's holding in her waistband.

""I'm not getting arrested,"" she tells him.

""What if there's 10 of them?"" he asks.

Elizabeth says she's not going to make the choice of being tortured and forced to give up everything she believes in.

""One day you could maybe find a way to make them understand,"" she tells Phillip, referring to their kids.

He tells her that ""if they are there"" and catch Phillip, ""they'll be at the house in an hour.""

Phillip heads to Viola's place. Inside, he asks Viola if she had any problems. Phillip turns and sees a man pointing a gun at him, saying, ""Give it to me."" Phillip pleads with the man not to shoot, all while moving just close enough to rip the gun away. After a long tussle, Phillip breaks the man's arm and takes the gun and points it at the man, then Viola. Asking who the man is, Viola admits he's her brother. She told him, but made him promise not to come. Phillip insists no one can ever know about this because they can always find her or her family and they'll ""pay the price."" She hands him the clock and he leaves.

Elizabeth asks Paige if she'd like to go to the mall to buy bras, but Paige tells her kids don't buy bras with their moms.

Elizabeth finds Phillip working on the clock. She sees his bruises from the fight and he tells her about Viola's brother. He thinks this whole thing is turning into a mess. She takes some headphones and goes into another room, then Phillip tests the bug he installed in the clock, quietly saying, ""Coming to you live, from the home of the Secretary of Defense.""

Elizabeth comes back in and says, ""Still joking. That's a good sign.""

The bug works.

Beeman gets home and no one is there. He looks out the window and sees Phillip playing street hockey in his driveway with Henry. He walks over and they chat a bit about sports, saying they should go play racquetball. They talk a little about how life is so pleasant in the area and Beeman offers Phillip some of his fancy Russian caviar. They eat it with tortilla clips as Beeman starts to explain how he stole the caviar from a guy he ran into while working a case. Phillip says it's salty, and Beeman says, ""That's what the beer is for.""

Phillip sneaks up on Viola on the street, gives her the clock and tells her to put it back and plug it back in. Then her son will be better. She asks him if he worries about God, but Phillip says he worries about Viola and her son, and moving on after this whole thing is done.

Beeman and Amador go back to the electronics store and start to torture him, shoving foam in his mouth and choking him, asking about the woman who came into the store and what she wanted.

Viola brings the clock back to Caspar Weinberger's study and pauses for a moment. Mrs. Weinberger walks by and says hello, and Viola says nothing.

Phillip is outside in his car, checking for sound from his transmitter. Nothing but static. He's not happy.

He comes back and tells Elizabeth that Viola ""made a choice"" and didn't put the clock back. He says they have to assume she's reporting everything. They can't go back to her apartment and Grayson is going to die.

""They'll know it was the KGB,"" Elizabeth says.

""Yeah, that was the risk they took,"" Phillip says. ""They didn't ask us.""

He's relieved that at least they weren't blown. Elizabeth says they have to finish the job. Phillip gets a call with a coded message, which he says is an emergency signal from Annelise.

With other FBI agents watching from a nearby van, Beeman discreetly stands next to the woman from the electronics store at a produce stand. He tells her he's an FBI agent and knows she's stealing fancy caviar and trading it for high-end stereo equipment she's sending back to Russia, where it's probably being sold. He tells her he knows she's probably breaking a bunch of Russian laws and would face time in a Siberian prison if he turns her in. He tells her she works for him now and gives her two chances to nod in agreement. She does.

Phillip picks up Annelise. She says she's tired of doing this and threatens to call the police. He stops the car and tells her she's ""been through a lot"" and what she did the other night was ""fantastic."" She asks him about how he was ready to save her that night, and then fantasizes about escaping to Sweden together. She tells him to just ""say yes"" for that night, even though she knows it's ""not real."" She goes on talking about this, then abruptly gets out of the car and tells Phillip, ""I'll see you later.""

Elizabeth is at Viola's apartment trying to talk her into putting the clock back to save her son. She won't budged. She says she listens to her lord. Phillip says there's been a misunderstanding between her and her lord, and begins to suffocate Grayson, demanding that she promise she'll put the clock back. She screams that she will, swearing to Jesus. Phillip and Elizabeth leave.

The next day, Viola puts the clock back just before Mrs. Weinberger walks in. Phillip, listening from his car, hears the signal clearly. We next see Elizabeth sitting in Viola's apartment, with Grayson shaking on the couch. The phone rings twice, then stops. She gives Grayson the antidote and takes a deep sigh.

That night, Phillip brings Elizabeth the tin of caviar. He asks if she ever had it before and she says, ""No, we couldn't afford this. We were like you, we had no money.""

They sit down and enjoy the caviar. Elizabeth goes on to tell Phillip that had a ""tingle"" earlier, like she knew things were about to go bad. She tells Phillip she saw Henry and Paige and him, then says, ""They shouldn't ask us to do impossible things.""

""No, but we did it,"" he says. ""And tonight, we're in the house of the Secretary of Defense. They must be after something very, very big. Something that changes things.""

A lead FBI agent is on the phone explaining that the last time they had a source inside the KGB was four years ago. He then hands the phone to Beeman, who listens intently and gives many thanks. He notes ""it's a team effort,"" which appeases Amador, who looked slightly annoyed for a moment. Beeman gets off the phone and says ""that was the president."" It was just the chief of staff, ""but still,"" Beeman says.

Elizabeth goes to Paige's room while she's sleeping. She wakes her up. She asks her if she wants to pierce her ears something they'd agreed Paige could do when she was 15.

""You can go to the mall and do it with your friends, or I can do it now,"" Elizabeth says.

Paige considers it for a minute and says, ""You do it.""

Meanwhile, Phillip is sitting beside Henry's bed, watching his son sleep with a tear rolling down his eye.

At the Soviet Embassy, the woman from the electronics store sees Vasili and Arkady congratulating each other over some news. She asks the man sitting next to her what that's about. He says Directorate S had a good night, but has no further details.

Vasili and the other man head to a closed office where Arkady presents the transmitter, turns up the volume and listens in on Defense Minister Nott's conversation with U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Nott says he and the prime minister are supportive of a ballistic missile shield, provided it covers Europe as well as the United States.

""Think what a different world it will be as soon as we don't have to worry about their nuclear missiles,"" Nott says.

""Amen to that,"" Weinberger replies.

Vasili and Arkady don't look so happy any longer."

One of the Russian spies was stabbed and killed. Agent Stan Beeman has also turned a Russian KGB operative after uncovering her bootlegging operation. Beeman lives in the same neighborhood as Philip, one of the Russian spies, and they're becoming friendly  despite Phillip knowing full well that Beeman snooped around his garage one night suspecting him of some kind of wrongdoing.

'Gregory': Beeman is dominating Philip at racquetball, talking about his strategy of making his opponent work too hard until he makes a mistake. Beeman gets a page and has to leave. Philip quips that where he comes from ""if you leave, you lose."" Beeman jokes, ""If that's the way you want to win"" before leaving. Philip says to himself, ""I'll win any way I can.""

Agent Amador briefs Beeman and they head out to an operation. Beeman meets with Nina, the KGB officer he turned. She tells him she overheard that they lost an officer the same night the other turned Russian spy vanished. She says she can help him, ""and one day you will help me."" Beeman agrees. She wants expatriation and safety. He tells her to slow down, vowing to protect her as long as she makes herself ""worth protecting."" She tells Beeman that the operative was stabbed and died at an area hospital. ""He wasn't just any operative,"" she says. ""He was Directorate S.""

Amador and Beeman lead a briefing about the operative's murder. Their director orders them to ask the DMV to review driver's license photos until they find a match.

Philip and his daughter Paige are out to breakfast. He's alarmed at the ""Girls' World"" magazine she's reading. Philip reads something in the classified ads of his newspaper that alarms him. He suddenly wants to leave. They go. Philip is slightly suspicious of a woman who interjected in his conversation with Paige for a moment.

Philip shows Elizabeth the newspaper and says it's a signal from Robert, but Robert has been dead for two weeks. The signal is asking for a meeting in Philadephia. Philip says he'll ""put Gregory on it.""

Elizabeth shows up at a park and interrupts Gregory's chess game. She turns down a cigarette from him, saying she's ""trying to be good.""

The Philadelphia DMV has provided a driver's license match to the FBI. Beeman is on it.

Elizabeth and Gregory go into his apartment to talk. He turns on some music. Elizabeth tells him she needs his team to cover a meet. Gregory starts rubbing Elizabeth's shoulders and kissing her on the neck, but she goes and sits on the couch.

""Can't do this anymore,"" she says, adding that ""things are changing at home with me and Philip.""

He thinks she's ""finally leaving him,"" but she says it's ""the opposite, actually.""

Gregory reminds Elizabeth that Philip is her ""cover,"" but she corrects him and says ""he's my husband.""

Gregory gets up and hands Elizabeth a notepad for her to give him the info to cover the meeting and he'll get it done.

At the corner of Market and Powelton streets in Philly, Gregory looks around and sees, among other things, a woman nervously sitting on a bench while holding a baby. She gets up to leave and some other activity starts. Some cars start moving.

""A wife?"" Philip asks Elizabeth back in their travel agency office. The woman must have been Robert's wife, which no one knew about, and Elizabeth adds that Robert was living in Philadelphia  another thing no one knew about. Philip is nervous.

Gregory reported that an FBI team was tailing her all the way to the park and stayed with her until she left. ""She didn't seem to know about it,"" she says.

They realize they don't know what Robert told his wife about himself or them. They decide they have to talk to her, even if the CIA is all over her. Elizabeth says she'll talk to Gregory.

Beeman gives a briefing about Robert's wife. His boss doesn't want to bring her in right away, thinking that wherever she leads them might be more valuable.

Elizabeth asks Gregory to get Robert's wife by Friday, if possible. He says it's possible, but it's also possible that he and his guys go to prison. Gregory tries to talk Elizabeth out of what he sees as her fake domestic life. She leaves and asks him to get his guys together.

The FBI supervisor leads another briefing, outlining the details: The night Timochev disappeared, Robert died of a stab wound at a local hospital, and three days ago they got confirmation he was a ""deep-cover KGB operative."" A year ago, Robert married Joyce Ana Ramirez, a Puerto Rican woman. They have a baby named Oscar. The FBI doesn't know what she knows. He tells one of the men in the briefing, ""You can tell the attorney general this is the closest we've come to a live KGB on American soil since we got Rudolph Abel in '57.""

Meanwhile, Gregory is following Joyce around Philadelphia. Gregory's men orchestrate a series of distractions, including a purse snatching and the theft of a large van to obscure the FBI's view of Joyce, to allow Gregory to take her into a building and drive her away out the other side.

Elizabeth and Philip get a chance to talk to Joyce, who says that Robert told her to place an ad ""and a friend would come"" if he didn't come home within two weeks. She says Robert told her he could trust them. ""What's going on?"" she asks. ""Where is he, is he dead?""

Philip says yes and Joyce breaks down. She asks if he was dealing drugs. ""Why did he have me call you? Is it money? There's money, right? To take care of us?""

Elizabeth assures her they're going to take care of her, but Philip says they need to know what Robert told her about them and what he did. She says Robert was ""quiet  he didn't say much  I liked that about him."" She pulls a note from her pocket that Robert told her to give them. It has a phone number on it, which she says Robert told her not to call so she didn't.

Philip takes the note into another room, where Gregory is standing. Gregory asks Philip if he loves Elizabeth. Philip is confused by the question and doesn't answer it. Gregory goes on to tell Philip about how he and Elizabeth ""clicked"" when they first met and she recruited him into the KGB and was ready to sacrifice his life and family.

""You don't have a family, do you Gregory?"" Philip says.

Gregory goes on to say that Elizabeth went to his place one month before Paige was born and said she couldn't go back to her life. Philip is mixing together a solution, in which he places the note with the phone number. Gregory goes on to ask Philip again if he loves Elizabeth.

""Because if you don't, leave her be,"" Gregory says. ""And if you do, leave her be.""

Meanwhile, in the water-based solution Philip has made, the note reveals another code of some kind. Philip pulls it out without responding to Gregory's words.

The FBI supervisor and Beeman are stunned that Joyce got away from a full FBI surveillance, and they think she's a Directorate S operative with the skills to make such a move. The supervisor is confident enough that the FBI can track her down again.

Elizabeth asks Philip about the message, it's another name and phone number. Philip asks Elizabeth what she suggests they do, and she says nothing. Gregory suggests they kill her and dump the body before they're blown. Philip decides to take a walk and warns Gregory that if he touches Joyce, he'll kill him.

Philip is out for his walk when he notices the woman from the coffee shop. He grabs her and pushes her against a wall, demanding to know who she is.

""I'm Gabriel's replacement,"" she says.

Philip wants to know what happened to Gabriel, and she says, ""The Center felt it was time for a change."" He tells her to never come near his kids again. She warns him never to put his hands on her again. Philip tells the woman about Robert's wife and the name and phone number he left.

The woman then reveals that the U.S. is working on a new technology that would jeopardize the Soviets' nuclear arsenal at risk. Robert was about to buy intel from an agent and the KGB was looking all over Boston for the agent when Robert died, but it's now clear he was doing his work in Philly. She suggests they call the phone number and set up a meeting.

The TV news is reporting Joyce's disappearance as a kidnapping. She sees this and tells Elizabeth, ""They're hunting me."" Elizabeth assures her they don't know where she is. Joyce is revealing how little she knows by telling Elizabeth how confused she is about all the weird instructions Robert left for her. She then remembers a time when she was out of town but came home early and surprised him. She found him listening to a strange-looking radio device and taking notes. He told her he was doodling, but she doesn't think he was doodling.

""He was a spy,"" she says, turning toward Elizabeth again. ""You're all spies.""

She's worried that Elizabeth is going to kill her and the baby. Elizabeth assures her that Robert would have wanted them to protect her.

Beeman and Amador are back in Philly, retracing Joyce's disappearance. A guy at a shoeshine stand overhears some of their conversation.

Philip prepares for the meeting and tells Elizabeth about ""Granny,"" Gabriel's replacement. He starts to leave and Elizabeth asks, ""Do you want to talk about it?"" Philip asks if she means Gregory. He tells her he didn't realize she was running off on him. Philip is upset that Elizabeth revealed her deepest secrets about her life and their relationship to Gregory and angrily says he'll go on pretending their domestic life is intact but she should go ahead and see Gregory whenever she needs to.

Philip shows up for the meeting and three men surround him and frisk him. He's escorted down a hall in a rundown building. He's guided into a cage-like room where he meets the guy he's presumably supposed to talk to.

""You got it?"" the man asks.

Philip says yes, but asks the man's guards to stay out of his ""blind spot"" behind him. They keep getting closer  almost intentionally messing with him, it seems  and Philip turns and takes them both out with some sneaky kicks and a couple of bashes to the gut with the briefcase, from which money billows after it pops open.

The man doesn't stand up from his seat, and Philip says, ""I did warn them, twice.""

""You did,"" the man says.

""You want to start a war, or do you want to give me what I came for an keep all this cash?"" Philip says.

The man calls for a woman to bring another briefcase. Philip, meanwhile, notices he's been cut a little in the stomach but covers it up. He opens the briefcase and reveals classified schematics for a nuclear X laser anti-ballistic missile ray. The man tells Philip he doesn't know what it is, ""I just made the deal."" Philip takes it and leaves.

Gregory is still worried about Joyce sticking around, but Elizabeth tells her she hasn't made a decision. He says she's making an emotional decision. Elizabeth slaps Gregory and asks why he told Philip about them. She wants to know whether it was to hurt Philip or get back at her.

""I was just trying to do right by you,"" Gregory says. ""I love you.""

He leaves and says, ""You want to be married to him, fine. But if you're going to do it, you can't do it on a lie.""

Beeman and Amador are still in Philly trying to figure out how Joyce got away. They look at the van that was used to shield the FBI surveillance team. Beeman crouches to tie his shoe and sees someone standing on the other side of the van. The man runs and Beeman and Amador give chase but lose him. Beeman can only wonder, ""What does some guy in the hood care about a KGB spy?""

Philip and Elizabeth drive Joyce to a dirt road to hand her off to Claudia, their new boss. Elizabeth tells her that ""they have passports, new names, it's all set."" Joyce thanks her.

Claudia tells Joyce she'll ""thrive"" in Cuba. Joyce gets in the black van and Claudia shuts it. She turns and takes the briefcase from Philip. Claudia gets back in the van and it drives away. Philip is still holding his stomach where he was cut. He turns silently and gets back in the car. Elizabeth stays behind for a moment, then goes to the car herself.

The next morning, Philip and Elizabeth are in the kitchen and she asks him if he's OK. He says he's fine and says nothing else. He puts an ice pack on his wound and sits at the kitchen table.

""I was 17 when I joined the KGB,"" Elizabeth starts to say. ""Never had a boyfriend. They put me with you, we didn't know each other. When we got here, I was 22 years old. I was living in a strange house in a strange country with a strange man, and I met Gregory and he was passionate about the cause; he was passionate about everything. He was passionate about me.""

She goes on to talk about how she recruited him, ""and he didn't even want anything  he just believed, like I did. He was the first person I felt like I could really talk to, and I needed that."" She's crying a bit as she talks and says, ""It just happened. It never really happened that way for us, did it?""

""No,"" Philip agrees.

Elizabeth says she's sorry and that she wishes it had. She holds his hand and says, ""But I feel like it's happening now.""

Back in Donestk, Soviet Union, a Russian agent tells a Robert's parents their son was a hero and would be proud to have his baby back home where he belongs. The baby is laying on the table in front of them but there is no sign of Joyce.

Philip planted a bug in the home of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and Soviet agents heard Weinberger talking about U.S. plans to coordinate with Britain on a nuclear missile defense system. FBI Agent Stan Beeman turned a woman within the Soviet Rezidentura who is now providing him intel. Elizabeth revealed to Philip that she was so young when she started her spy work that they never really formed their relationship, but she feels like ""it's happening now.""

'In Control': News reports talk about Russian military exercises that are being seen as threatening. After rushing the kids off to school, Elizabeth asks Philip if they're ""still on for"" without finishing her sentence. He says yes.

At the FBI, the supervisor, Agent Gaad, tells Beeman and Amador about customs agents stopping the son of the Romanian Deputy Chief of Mission on his way back to Bucharest with three pounds of marijuana. He's going to be brought to the FBI. Gaad wants Beeman and Amador to ""take a run at him"" and see what he'll offer to stay out of trouble back home, or, as he puts it, ""See if he wants to keep his balls.""

Elizabeth is in a hotel room when Philip knocks on the door. They say nothing as he walks in and they start to kiss. Apparently, it really is ""happening now.""

Amador is quizzing Beeman with flash cards on his Russian, but everything stops when Gaad delivers news that President Reagan has been shot. The agents all head into ""the vault.""

After their little afternoon delight, Philip thanks Elizabeth for suggesting they take the afternoon off.

News reports show the shooting of Reagan and Gaad wants to know immediately if the KGB was behind it. The director tells Beeman he wants agents at the embassy, but not him.

Philip and Elizabeth are leaving the hotel when they first hear reports of Reagan's shooting. They head off to find out what they can.

Back at the FBI, Gaad continues to demand for any connection between Hinkley, the shooter, and the KGB or the Communist Party. He then asks Beeman to check with his contact. Beeman says he has a signal that can get him in touch with her within 24 hours, but Gaad wants action faster.

Philip meets with a journalist friend, Sparrow, who says he has ""no access at all."" Philip asks for the names of the nurses who were around the president. The journalist who has been identifying himself as a former Socialist turned conservative tells Philip he hopes Reagan dies on the operating table. Philip tells him his ""commitment to the struggle always was total.""

Elizabeth meets with Claudia as the radio news reports Jim Brady's death from the shooting. Claudia says there is no time for signals today and tells Elizabeth she needs to gather her supplies for ""Operation: Christopher."" Claudia says she's heard so much about Elizabeth and that they'll do ""great things together,"" but she didn't expect it to start this way. Elizbaeth asks Claudia, ""Did we do this?"" Claudia doesn't think so, but says ""they'll try to pin it on us."" She also mentions that the Red Army might move into Poland in the next 24 hours. Elizabeth mentions ""Operation: Christopher"" and asks if this is ""headed toward guerrilla warfare."" Claudia hopes not, but needs Elizabeth to find out how the president is doing and about attempts to blame the Russians. She says the Rezidentura will be ""worthless."" Elizabeth says they'll start preparations for ""Christopher"" right away. Claudia tells Elizabeth she'll ""do well"" if she falls behind enemy lines.

Things are buzzing at the Rezidentura and Beeman calls his contact, Nina, and she asks if they can discuss the next day. He says there's a deadline.

Elizabeth is in an isolated area, digging up a large crate. In a flashback, we see a similar crate in her house as her mother and a man lament the passing of Stalin. The man is courting Elizabeth's mother, saying she and her daughter (""Nadezhda"") will need ""help"" ""every woman needs a man,"" he says and offers some supplies that are in the crate from the committee storehouse. Elizabeth's mother thanks him, but declines the offer and says they can manage on their own. Back with Elizabeth and the crate, she clips some wires it was set to explode in the wrong hands before opening it. She pulls out some serious weaponry and more explosives.

A man in a basement with a table full of telephones gets a call from Philip, who identifies himself as ""Steve."" He says he needs the vice president's office deputy chiefs of staff. The man says he can set up the line in 15 minutes and Philip will call back.

News reports about Reagan continues to show up on TVs as Beeman and Amador wait for sign of Nina from a window across the street. She gets up to leave, but her boss orders her to sit in on a meeting.

Elizabeth is back and Philip says he has names. She says she got orders to be ready for Operation: Christopher, adding, ""This could be a coup."" She shows him all the artillery in the trunk of the car. He says they'll need a car and she says she'll signal Gregory.

Inside the house, Paige is bothered by the news showing the shooting over and over again. She thinks it's ""ghoulish."" Matthew Beeman Stan's teenage son is sitting with her and says it's ""pretty ghoulish"" that anyone who was shot in the incident could die.

One of Gregory's men brings Philip and Elizabeth a Lincoln Town Car with U.S. government license plates. He says he needs it back in a couple of hours. They drive away.

Nina is still in her office looking for a chance to get away and tells her boss, Vasili, she's headed to a bar with Congressional aides hang out, just in case she can pick up any info. He says that's a great idea and asks her to report back to him directly when she's back. ""Moscow needs us to be ahead of the curve,"" he says. After she leaves, Vasili asks another man in the office to follow her.

Philip and Elizabeth see a woman named Dana Simon arrive at her home. They present themselves as deputy chiefs of staff for the vice president's office. They thank her for everything she did that day. They tell her this crisis is ""about as political as a crisis can get."" She says they're quietly checking with everyone to make sure what they're hearing about the president's condition is true. She says he's going to pull through. They thank her and ask her to keep their meeting confidential. They give her a business card with a phone number where they can be reached, and Philip gives her a collectable pin from the vice president's office.

It's dark now, but Beeman sees Nina pull up in a cab. He heads outside while Amador keeps watch from the window. Amador sees the car apparently following Nina and prepares to say something. Beeman notices it, too, and walks by Nina without stopping or saying anything. Amador, too, said nothing.

Elizabeth and Philip are delivering a message in code saying that their hospital source is confirming Reagan's condition is stable. Elizabeth insists they check for confirmation that no one is taking over the government. Philip is a little annoyed, thinking Moscow is overreacting.

Inside the bar, Nina is overhearing Congressional aides talking about the line of succession if Reagan were to die.

Paige goes to Matthew's house and tells her she's sorry for what she'd said earlier. She says she's noticed it's ""horrible"" that the Secret Service agent (Timothy McCarthy) turned in front of the bullet. She says it made her think about the job his dad does as an FBI agent. She says her dad is just a travel agent. They make some sarcastic comments about how the world of a travel agent can be ""filled with peril.""

Philip and Elizabeth are set up outside Weinberger's house, with Philip setting up to take a shot at him with a sniper rifle. A neighborhood security guard notices the van and says he needs to call the cops in to assist in searching their van because there's been a rash of break ins. He goes back to his car and Elizabeth calmly walks up next him and shoots him in the head with a silencer. She gets in his security patrol car and drives away. Philip follows in the van.

Philip worries that if there is a war, they might have just fired the first shot. They argue over who ""started it."" Philip says they are the ones escalating things.

Nina walks around outside and slips into Beeman's car. She tells Beeman he can't call her at the embassy. She thinks she'll be killed. He assures her he called from a secure line and isn't being followed. She says she knows nothing about the assassination attempt, but ""everyone was freaking out, while running around like cut-off chickens."" He corrects her on the phrase and then has to assure her he doesn't think it's a joke. She says the Russians are worried the U.S. is trying to pin the shooting on them ""to justify the coup."" They think that Gen. Alexander Haig's announcement that he was in charge of the government until the vice president returned was a coup. Beeman says that's not what happened.

""Both sides have their finger on the trigger, and that's how that happens,"" Nina says.

""How what happens?"" Beeman asks.

""One mistake,"" she says. ""That's all it takes.""

Philip and Elizabeth are listening to the tap from Weinberger's office. There isn't much useful at first, but then they hear some chatter about the nuclear football. Elizabeth says they need to get it to Moscow, but Philip wants to check it out first. She wants to move on it immediately, but Philip tries to assure her that there is no coup in the works. He tells her she still doesn't know how things work in the U.S. She accuses him of having forgotten where he came from.

Beeman tells Gaad that his source says the Russians had nothing to do with the shooting. There's some tension, suddenly, between Beeman and Amador, and Amador reveals that he saw the follow car behind Nina but didn't say anything because there was a glare and he couldn't see the occupants' faces. Beeman tells him next time just tell him there's glare and he'll ""act accordingly.""

Philip and Paige watch the news and ""Charles Duluth,"" the journalist Philip had spoken to earlier and Elizabeth had referred to as Sparrow, is on talking about how concerned ""we"" (conservatives) are about Reagan, ""for the implications of his recovery on the world stage."" Elizabeth notices that Beeman is home across the street and suggests they go over and ""see how they got through the day.""

They go over to the Beemans' house and talk it over. Beeman immediately recalls how he reacted when Kennedy was shot and Elizabeth quickly chimes in, saying, ""Yeah, nothing really felt safe after that."" Elizabeth asks Beeman if he thinks ""it's going to all be alright."" Beeman says it'll be fine and adds that Hinkley is ""100 percent nuts,"" adding that Hinkley was trying ""impress this movie star, Jodie Foster."" Beeman tells them they had to investigate whether the Russians were involved but it looks like they weren't, ""which is a good thing because that could've started World War III."" Philip and Elizabeth nod and agree, ""Yeah.""

We next see Philip out in the wilderness tapping out a code that an FBI source confirms Hinkley acted alone and that the U.S. government won't blame the U.S.S.R. for the shooting. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is in bed alone and flashes back to her life in Russia as a child after the man with the crate left. She insists that he was trying to help them, but her mother says he wanted something from them.

""What did he want?"" Elizabeth asked her mother, who doesn't respond to the question but tells her young daughter that she has to rely on only herself in this world, no one else.

Back at the Beemans' house, Stan's wife is quiet but says ""never mind"" when he asks what's going on. She says it feels petty to think about this sort of thing, then admits she was happy when they lived in St. Louis. She says they made a good life while he was out on his assignment, but she thought they would get to know each other again now that he's back. She tells him he never talks to her and asks why it's so hard.

""I don't know,"" he says, adding that he was ""living with psycho-militants for too long."" He says ""it just doesn't feel like it did before."" He says he's trying.

Philip gets home and finds Elizabeth in bed awake. She tells him she's glad they did it his way this time, and that ""the center was lucky to have you on the ground today."" Philip says that if Moscow ever finds out they sat on the Haig intelligence, ""we're finished.""

She hugs him and says, ""I won't tell if you won't.""

They kiss and fall into bed together."

Claudia told Phillip that the Americans are trying to build a defense system that would wipe out Russia's nuclear arsenal. Meanwhile, Elizabeth and Phillip are trying to start give their relationship the real start they never had.

'Comint': Elizabeth shows up at a man's house posing as a security company inspector. She tells the man the Department of Defense mandated a security review of all private contractors. She says she wanted to wait out of respect and says she's ""very sorry"" about his wife. He reports his name, Adam Dorwin, manager of Vizio Tech Laser Operations Group. He has top-secret clearance. She asks if he's received any communications from foreign agents and proceeds with questions. He says his contacts in the DoD are ""trustworthy idiots."" In the 35 years and eight months he was married to his wife, he says she never asked a single question about the classified work he did.

Elizabeth meets with Claudia in the car on a rainy night. Elizabeth says she could've cracked him in 30 seconds and that ""he needs his handler now, face to face, or we're going to lose him."" Claudia says the handler has left four signals ""for him"" in the last week. She says there's been no meeting because everyone's locked up in the Rezidentura and that because the FBI surveillance teams are using new encryption on their radios, the Russian agents can't tell when they're being followed, so there's no way to meet an agent. Elizabeth offers to go explain the situation. Claudia says that's not how the Russians operate. The CIA lets agents' handlers switch in an out and ""there's no real bond."" Claudia tells her about an agent she once ran in West Germany a loner oddball who never really learned to make a friend. She befriended him and many years later, as she was leaving, they didn't need him any more. She explained it all to him, he thanked her for the opportunity to work with her, and killed himself shortly after.

""We didn't need him anymore, but he needed us,"" Claudia says.

Claudia tells Elizabeth they can't lose Agent Udacha and she must find a way to get the FBI's encryption codes so the contact can meet with the one man he trusts.

Dorwin calls Vasili from a pay phone. Vasili says he shouldn't be calling him there but promises they'll meet soon. Dorwin hangs up and leaves.

Elizabeth crosses paths with Beeman and Phillip while driving into the office. They're are on their way back from racquetball. They're pretty chummy, which seems to make Elizabeth a little uneasy. Beeman says he can give Phillip a ride to the office.

At the Rezidentura, Vasili helps show ""Ninotchka"" (Nina) the proper way to brew her tea. He says shortcuts ""are the root of all evil."" His approach takes longer, but he says the tea will taste better, that ""waiting is a lost art."" He urges her to try it his way from the start next time.

Agent Amador laments that Martha, a woman he dated in the office for a couple of months, never wore sexy shoes when she was with him. Now she's sporting heels. Agent Gaad comes up with a transcript of Dorwin's conversation from the phone booth with Vasili, but they don't know who was on either end of the line. All they know is that one man said: ""I feel like I'm standing on a diving board at the edge of an empty pool"". Gaad says he smells an opportunity. Amador compliments Martha's shoes when she comes over to deliver a message to Gaad. She says that's sexism and Gaad agrees. He rolls his eyes when she walks away.

Beeman talks with Nina. He tries to convince her that he's on her side and she should think of him as a wall that's protecting her. He asks her to find out what's going on quickly and that they don't have any leeway. He tells her she's beautiful and smart and capable and beautiful again. He tries to say ""trust me"" in Russian, but she tells him that the way he's saying it makes it sound like she has no choice.

Martha is at home and Phillip is there, posing as ""Clark,"" the counterintelligence guy she's seeing. Martha seems quiet and Phillip leans in to kiss her. He says he's been wanting to do that ""for a very long time"" and wishes things were different with them. He says they can't trespass any boundaries, because he has to protect the nation's counterintelligence efforts. He compliments her shoes and she says they're new. He tells her he's worried about the FBI's surveillance. He's ""concerned the company wasn't properly vetted."" He gets her to reveal the name of the consultant, Kurt Schultz.

At the Soviet Embassy, Vasili and Arkady are talking about how they can't lose Agent Udacha. They agree that if the FBI gets to Udacha before he can, they'll lose everything. Arkady says Udacha will take the whole network with him. Vasili says he can't meet him until he can get the FBI off his back.

At home that night, Elizabeth chides Phillip for playing too much racquetball with his ""new best friends"" and says he should keep his distance. He asks what is going with the encryption guy. She says her plan is to pose as a rival looking for a job.

We next see her having sex with a man presumably Kurt Schultz in a hotel room while asking if this means she and her boss can buy his company. He finishes quickly, but proceeds to spank Elizabeth a few times before pulling out a belt and using it. She tells him it hurts and he says it's supposed to. She rolls off the bed and curls up in a ball asking him to stop and just as he's about to use the buckle end of the belt she screams and cries, ""Don't hurt me!"" He stops and tries to quiet her down. She gets up to get dressed.

Nina brings some tea to Vasili in his office and says she took his advice. She closes the door behind her and starts to take off her blouse.

""Why? Why now?"" he asks her.

""I think we're both a little lonely,"" she says.

Elizabeth tells Schultz that if her boss knew what he was into he wouldn't want to buy his company. Schultz claims the price $3 million is too low anyway. She says she knows what it's worth. He says ""there are things that aren't in the paperwork, try $30 (million)."" He mentions the classified work his company does, and goes on to say he's figured out how to make a signal cloaking system portable.

""Portable?"" she asks.

""Small enough to fit in the trunk of an FBI car,"" he says. ""Wherever they go, it goes with them. Thirty million, not a penny less.""

Nina is buttoning her blouse and Vasili thanks her for her ""kindness in a difficult time."" She says ""that's what difficult times call for."" She goes on to ask him if he's alright, noting that she'd heard something the other day.

His response is to ask her if she knows what loyalty is. He tells her about an agent he recruited there 23 years earlier. He says the man was ""a bureaucrat with a soul"". He says the man now has ""jitters"" and mimics jitters to explains what they are. He plans to reassure him everything will be fine. She asks him if it will. Vasili turns and tells her he hopes they'll be able to meet again.

Elizabeth gets home and tells Phillip she ""got it."" She takes off her shirt and the belt marks are visible all over her back. He asks what happened and she says ""nothing.""

""It happens sometimes, Phillip,"" she says.

Phillip vows to ""deal with it,"" but Elizabeth says she could have dealt with it herself. ""I wanted the intel and I got it,"" she adds. Philip says he'll be back in an hour. She tells him she doesn't need him to fight her battles for her. He gets a gun and heads out of the house, but she stops him by saying, ""You are not my daddy.""

He tells her he's her ""husband, what do you think husbands do?""

""I wouldn't know,"" she says.

The next morning, Phillip is agitated and being short with Henry for losing his thermos.

Nina reports back to Beeman about Vasili's plans to meet with the agent who has ""jitters."" Beeman asks how she got Vasili to talk and she says in more colorful terms she gave him oral sex ""just like you told me to"". Beeman stammers to clarify that's not what he said and that he ""wouldn't."" The horn of a passing train is the only thing that breaks the silence for a moment. Beeman tells her she'll live a new life one day and will have a new name. He wants her to choose the name of someone who sleeps very well at night. He says ""we have to nail down when that meeting is happening.""

""We?"" she asks.

Elizabeth reports to Claudia about the surveillance systems in the FBI cars. Claudia asks Elizabeth if everything is OK. She says yes, but it's been a tough couple of days. They have a conversation about female empowerment, based on the equal rights laws being considered in the U.S. Claudia says that she and Elizabeth have already known for years that they have to fight for their equality instead of waiting for the laws to change. Claudia says she'll get Elizabeth some info on the FBI cars, but they keep their vehicles under very close guard. Elizabeth says they'll figure it out.

The next day, Elizabeth and Phillip are driving and Elizabeth says the second car behind them is the FBI. Phillip asks Elizabeth if she's going to be mad forever. She say she's not mad and ""at least I'm not tormenting little boys about lost thermoses."" Phillip slams the brakes on the car in order to get the car behind him to stop short and the FBI car to crash into it. Phillip drives off while the FBI agents have to apologize to an elderly woman for rear-ending her.

We next see the FBI car in the shop. Phillip tells Elizabeth where the car is and says he'll distract some of the mechanics while she gets something from the FBI car. He distracts while she climbs into the trunk of the FBI car, which is on a lift. She slips an encryption card out of the portable security device and makes an imprint of it. She's about to get out of the car when it starts moving down the lift. Phillip sees it coming down. The FBI agents are told their car is ready and they start to head toward it. Phillip tries to think quickly. He goes to get his car but the mechanic says he needs to keep it overnight. Phillip tells him he needs it now as the FBI agents are already driving away.

The FBI agents drive back to FBI headquarters with Elizabeth still in the trunk. They park and leave the car in the lot.

We see Phillip pull over on the side of the road and check his trunk. Elizabeth is not there.

In the FBI parking lot, Elizabeth gets out of the trunk and starts walking around unnoticed. She walks right through the gates, giving a ""see ya"" and confident wave to the guards as she leaves.

Phillip is waiting for her with coffee and a donut. He apologizes about their argument. She says they have to do all sorts of things for their work, ""and it requires being a certain way."" He asks her what she's talking about. She says that she wishes each night that she'll ""wake up and not be worried."" He asks about what and she says, ""Everything.""

""You can't live like that,"" he says.

""Show me another way,"" she replies.

Beeman is listening to Russian language lessons on tape at home. His wife asks if he's coming to bed. She's wearing a new negligee. He says, ""Oh, you're killing me"", and continues to listen to his tapes. She reminds him about all the fun and sometimes romantic things they used to do before his assignment away. She tells him life was ""pretty freaking great, remember?"" He says he does, and says he won't be that long with the tapes. She goes to bed.

Vasili is in his office again, with Nina doing her thing under the desk. Arkady bursts in, doesn't see Nina, and tells Vasili that they got the encryption codes. He tells Arkady to signal Udacha for a meet the next day at 14:00. Arkady leaves. Vasili sighs.

The next day, Nina waits for Beeman at a random spot on the street. He pulls up and she tells him the KGB has the FBI's encryption code and the meeting with the agent is happening at 2 p.m. He thanks her and speeds away.

Gaad calls out to Amador to get his teams ready, and he goes to another agent to tell him to get the codes in the trunk units changed.

Vasili is worried now at the Embassy, saying that they've lost all the FBI communications, it's all static. Arkady suggests they've changed the code. Now they're worried Udacha will go off the deep end, but Arkady warns Vasili that he could be leading the FBI to Udacha himself, if he goes through with the meeting.

""We have no choice,"" Vasili says.

Amador and Beeman are staking things out. They talk about relationships for a moment until they see Vasili walking around the corner. They get out to follow him. We also see Udacha who we know as Dorwin walking with a briefcase, apparently toward a meeting. They follow Vasili, who goes and stands at the waterfront along the banks for the Potomac. He's just ""gazing,"" as Beeman puts it. Vasili checks his watch.

We see Dorwin/Udacha standing somewhere, also checking his watch. He turns and starts to ask, ""Did my friend send you?"" He's cut off by a bullet in the head, which Elizabeth fires.

Vasili looks as some birds fly through the sky. His sad look means something isn't right, and the look on Beeman's face, who is watching Vasili from afar makes it fairly clear he knows, too. We see Elizabeth walk away.

Phillip meets with Claudia on the street that night. She tells him about the FBI changing their encryption codes right away within the day, ""like they knew."" They understand they have a mole.

Vasili is angry with Arkady for having cabled Moscow without his permission. Arkady says there is a mole and the center demands they use ""any and all measure to catch them."" He says that's exactly what they're going to do.

Phillip gets home and finds Elizabeth asleep. She quietly asks, ""What had she say?""

""Don't worry about it,"" Phillip says. ""I'll tell you in the morning."""

She got her boss to reveal information to her by giving him oral sex, and told Beeman that he ""told"" her to. He insists she misunderstood. Phillip's FBI counterintelligence source told him ""they were in the secure vault all day,"" but she didn't know what was happening there. The Russian spies got the FBI's communication encryption codes, but they were changed immediately, which led Claudia to believe there is a mole.

'Trust Me': Phillip and Elizabeth are concerned about the mole, wondering how it could happen. Elizabeth gives Phillip a big kiss before leaving to take the kids to the mall.

Phillip calls his FBI source and flirts with her and tells her he'd like to see her some time, socially. She says she has to work. It's a Sunday. He insists she can be a half hour late.

""Great,"" he says. As soon as he hangs up the phone, four men sneak up behind the phone booth he's in and put a hood over his head before tossing him into the back of a van. The van takes off.

Phillip is in a chair in a big, empty warehouse space. A man approaches and tells him all the vital facts of his own life. Phillip seems to realize the jig is up. The man says the details of Phillip's life before 1963 ""seem to be a little bit hazy.""

""We know who you are and what you are, Mr. Jennings,"" he says, leaning into Phillip's face now.

Meanwhile, Nina is putting her clothes on while Vasili is still in bed. He urges her to come back and lay with him, telling her she's his ""medicine."" She says he's been under a lot of stress lately and he says ""it's a dark time"" and adds that the Rezidentura has been penetrated. She gets up and and asks if he's sure. She lays down again, not facing him as he tells her that it's his fault and she tries to convince him otherwise. He says they'll ""find this traitor and put a bullet in his head. It's only a matter of time.""

At the FBI, Agent Gaad calls Beeman in on Sunday and asks for his take on something. Gaad hands Beeman a file. It's the file on Dorwin's killing  about two miles from where the FBI was following Vasili. Gaad tells Beeman about the missile defense program  he doesn't have more details  but Dorwin was project manager for Viziotech, which was working on the missile technology. A month ago, some top-secret blueprints disappeared. Beeman realizes Dorwin was shot at the exact same time the FBI was tracking the Rezident (Vasili).

Elizabeth is at home, cutting onions, when she thinks she hears something and starts to walk around the house suspiciously  with the knife in her hand. She's in her bedroom when a man about three times her size sneaks up from behind and grabs her. Elizabeth works some serious close-combat skills and frees herself by slamming him against the wall, now in the hallway near the stairs. She then busts out some serious punches, elbows and kicks to knock him out. She turns, takes one breath and next sees the bottom of a lamp or vase striking her in the face before everything goes black.

Paige and Henry are waiting for Elizabeth to pick them up. She's an hour late. Paige calls home and there's no answer. They start walking and Paige hitchhikes. Henry says they aren't supposed to hitchhike.

Nina meets with Beeman in his car and tells him she's done because they're looking for a mole and are going to kill her. He tells her to trust him.

Phillip is getting beaten with a phone book and the man questioning him wants a list of every KGB agent he knows. Then he wants to know all the dead-drop sites and KGB communication protocols.

""It's up to you how long we do this,"" the man says.

Phillip insists he's not a spy. The man goes to a tape player and plays a recording of Phillip talking to his FBI source. The man shows Phillip the many different passports Phillip has, and start to talk about the kids, who are technically American citizens. He suggests that maybe the kids will become wards of the United States government. The man turns and says, ""Bring her in!"" Elizabeth is pulled into the room.

A guy stops and offers Paige and Henry a ride. Henry first shakes his head, but Paige eventually coaxes Henry into the car. The young man introduces himself as Nick. Henry doesn't want to shake the guy's hand.

Elizabeth is thrown into a small room that has pictures of Henry and Paige taped to all the walls.

Gaad tells Beeman that the ""dead guy"" (Dorwin) has high-security access. Gaad wants to know what Beeman's friend (Nina) has said about Dorwin. Beeman tells Gaad that Nina is in trouble. Gaad reminds Beeman that these are dangerous operations. Beeman asks for access to some of the jewels seized in a recent bust.

Nick, the driver, says he wants to make a quick stop. He hands Paige a bag of bread. Nick says it's ""for the ducks""  he always feeds them on his way to work.

Phillip is being dunked into a tank of water now, but refuses to talk. The man questioning him leaves to get Elizabeth. She refuses to get up, so two other men carry her out of the room.

Nick stops to feed the ducks, but Paige says they need to get home. Nick grabs a six pack of beer and they walk to the edge of a pond. Nick hands Paige a beer and she takes a sip, not liking it. Nick then hands Henry the bag of bread so he can feed the ducks. Nick tells Paige she's ""definitely going to be a knockout in a couple of years."" He tells the kids it's dangerous to hitchhike and they're lucky they ran into him ""and not some lunatic."" They start to leave and Nick shouts at them to stay. They stop. Nick tells Henry to grab him another beer. Henry goes to get one and Nick starts talking about how he wished he had someone to keep him on the straight and narrow, and begins to talk about God. Henry notices a knife in Nick's waistband and smashes the beer bottle over Nick's head. Henry and Paige run away.

Beeman and Nina meet and he hands her a camera, asking her to photograph documents at the Rezidentura  it doesn't matter what they are, as long as they're classified. He tells her this is the plan, but she thinks it's suicide. He tells her he's been where she is, knows the fear she's experiencing. He says he can get her out, but she has to stay with him. He convinces her she won't be caught. She says that even if she can take the pictures, she won't be able to sneak them out because of tight security. He says she won't have to.

Elizabeth is brought to a chair where she's now sitting across from Phillip. The man questioning him says Phillip can help Elizabeth and ""save her a lot of pain.""

""What do you think you're going to get from us?"" Phillip asks.

The man, suddenly interested in Phillip speaking, asks Phillip what his answer to that question would be. Phillip says, ""Nothing."" He says they'll get nothing and that both he and Elizabeth are trained for this.

""We'll die before we talk,"" Elizabeth says.

""And we know how to do that,"" Phillip says.

Suddenly, Claudia's voice calls out, ""That's enough.""

She walks into the room and orders the men to untie them both. She says, ""I'm sorry. We had to know if you were the mole, if we could trust you.""

Phillip is angry. He tells Claudia they should be the last people who should be suspected. Claudia says they had to know. Elizabeth asks if Claudia had permission for this, if Zhukov knew about it.

""This decision was made far above Zhukov's head,"" Claudia says.

Elizabeth elbows Claudia in the stomach. Phillip quickly grabs his questioner's gun and pushes him to the ground while Elizabeth dunks Claudia's head into the water. Phillip shouts, ""That's enough!""

Elizabeth throws Claudia to the ground and starts punching her face repeatedly, leaving it severely swollen and bruised, and yelling that she's going to kill her. She shouts at Claudia, ""Tell whoever approved this that your face is a present from me to them!""

Phillip pulls Elizabeth off and demands his car from the guy who was questioning him  still pointing the man's own gun at him. He tells the man to sit down and gives Elizabeth some rope. She ties the man to the chair.

Phillip and Elizabeth leave the warehouse, wondering ""how could they do that to us."" Phillip asks what they did to her and she says it was just psychological pressure, ""pictures of the kids.""

""They stopped?"" Phillip asks, suggesting that Elizabeth told the interrogators that he was considering defecting. She insists she didn't. He thinks she's lying. She stammers a bit and finally says, ""I told them that you liked it here too much.""

Phillip walks away, but Elizabeth yells at him, telling him not to act like she made it up. He yells back that he ""fit in, like I was supposed to."" He says he liked, ""so what?"" He says he was supposed to be able to trust her and he did, and he shouldn't have. She says that's not true. He walks away.

Paige and Henry get home to a dark, empty house. Henry is down and wonders, ""What if he wasn't going to do anything bad to us?"" Paige says Nick was a creep and what Henry did took courage. Henry says he was scared, and Paige says what happened has to be their secret. Henry still looks worries and sheepish, and admits he ""had an accident,"" looking down at his pants.

Nina is inside the embassy when she goes to a file cabinet to get some classified files. She tucks them into her jacket and goes into the restroom to snap pictures. She brings the file back and a man sneaks up behind her and asks if she's alright. She says yes and he walks away.

Phillip and Elizabeth drive home in silence. Phillip puts on his seat belt, veers off the road on purpose and smashes into a tree. He and Elizabeth both get out of the car without saying anything and stare at the damage.

Vasili buys some tea and the cashier seems to accidentally drop his change on the floor. Vasili bends down to pick up the coins while the man apologizes. While Vasili isn't looking, the cashier drops something extra into Vasili's bag and says, ""Enjoy!"" as Vasili leaves. After Vasili walks out, the cashier calls Beeman and says, ""It's done.""

Beeman calls the embassy which his call routed through a phone booth and asks for Vasili. When the man who answers  the same man who'd snuck up on Nina  asks to take a message, Beeman says to tell Vasili there is a tea shop in Picadilly Circus ""that I know he'll enjoy when he's not under the gun."" Beeman says to tell him the message is from Theo and says, ""He'll know,"" when asked about Theo's last name.

Nina goes and knocks on Vasili's door, and he lets her in.

Phillip and Elizabeth get home and, to explain their scrapes and bruises, tell them they were in a car accident. Henry tells them their friend Shelley's mom drove them home. Phillip gets the kids off to bed.

Phillip tells Elizabeth he's going to go see Martha, his FBI contact, and wants to make up for missing the date. He asks her if she has any jewelry he can give her. Elizabeth goes to her dresser and retrieves something in a box. Based on their silent exchange, it was obviously something that was supposed to have been meaningful between them.

""I'm sure she'll love it,"" Elizabeth says. Phillip scoffs and leaves.

Beeman calls the Soviet embassy again and asks for Vasili again, saying it's urgent. Vasili, meanwhile, is having sex with Nina. The man who answers says that he can't help unless ""Theo"" gives him more information.

Elizabeth meets up with Gregory and asks him to watch her children and Phillip. He asks her what's going on and she explains that there's a mole and she needs to know if she's being watched. He says he'll be her eyes.

Vasili meets with Arkady and they discuss the odd messages from ""Theo,"" which came from three different locations, including a phone booth outside FBI headquarters. Vasili insists he didn't understand any of them. Arkady says they'll need to ""do a light search,"" and Vasili says he understands and would do the same. Arkady calls in a man to help with the search. He asks Vasili to empty his pockets, which he does. Arkady sees the tea bag on Vasili's desk and the other man opens it and pours the tea onto the desk. Hidden in the tea are jewels. Vasili says he doesn't know where they came from.

A deeper search ensues and Vasili defends his spotless record. Arkady says all will be fine if the search turns up nothing. Then, one of the men searching the place discovers a clock with a camera hidden in the back. It's the same camera Nina was using. Arkady holds up the camera and says, ""Diamonds for information."" Vasili smiles and says he's been set up.

""Remarkably well, wouldn't you say?"" Arkady says, and Vasili's face turns cold.

Nina heads up the stairs and sees Vasili being escorted out by two guards. She says nothing.

Gaad calls Beeman at home that night and says the Rezident ""jumped ship"" and is headed back to Russia.

""Just him?"" Beeman asks.

""Just him,"" Gaad confirms. Beeman says he appreciates the call and Gaad says, ""I thought you might.""

Beeman's wife asks if everything is OK, and Beeman says everything is good. She starts to ask him if there's anything he can share with her about his work, even about his boss getting on his nerves or his partner thinking he's funny.

Beeman tells her that sometimes what he does gets scary  not for him  but he has to worry about people, ""and today it got pretty scary, but it worked out."" He say sit was a tough day, but it was a good day. She says she's glad. They kiss and Beeman turns out the light. His wife nestles her head on his chest while he stares off, thinking about Nina.

Phillip tells Martha about his car accident. She kisses him. She asks him if there's someone else who can work with her so that they can be together. He says that's not possible, but he wants to give her something so she'll know how he feels. He pulls out the box and we see its a necklace with a diamond heart pendant, which he places around her neck.

Phillip gets home and tells Elizabeth that Martha ""got over it."" She asks what he wants from her and he says ""it doesn't matter you already did it, there's no undoing it."" She tells him he's not the only one who got hurt that day. She was ripped from her house and attacked ""by the people I believed in - the people I trusted most my whole life.""

""Yeah, I think that says it all,"" Phillip says, slamming the bedroom door shut as he goes to sleep on the couch."

Agent Beeman had sex with Nina, his Rezidentura mole, and wants to get her exfiltrated. Agent Gaad says he'll ""think about it."" Phillip, meanwhile, reconnected and had sex with Irina, his girlfriend back in Russia before he became a spy, but told Elizabeth that nothing happened.

'Mutually Assured Destruction: Elizabeth is doing some decoding. Phillip gets back from racquetball with Stan and tells Elizabeth she was right about detecting trouble in the Beeman house. He tells her he missed her while he was gone and they kiss. She tells him there's ""trouble at work."" They have to stop a Russian assassin who was hired to kill scientists in the U.S. anti-ballistics missile program, but they changed their minds and were unable get back in touch with him. He had a hit list of 14 possible scientist. They don't know when he's going to kill them, or who he is.

Phillip and Elizabeth stake out one of the possible scientists. They've planted a bomb in the man's car. As a warning shot, they kill the car's engine so that the scientist will look under the hood. He does, sees the bomb and gets his wife out just before Phillip detonates the bomb. This was all an effort to get the government to give its scientists some protection.

At the FBI, Gaad briefs his group on the car bomb. Gaad says car bombs haven't been the KGB's M.O.. Agent Amador suggests they put security on more people, but Gaad says they can't chase their tails. He wants to find out who did this.

Elizabeth meets with Claudia and asks why they'd hire an assassin and try to call him off. Claudia tells Elizabeth ""the contractor"" is from West Germany and gives her some info on a weapons dealer in Baltimore he might be contacting. Claudia then tells Elizabeth that despite the bad blood between them, she feels a ""camaraderie"" with her. Claudia then tells Elizabeth that Phillip ""was with"" the agent he was assigned to, but Elizabeth is suspicious, saying she ""can think of five different reasons"" she'd poison their life. Elizabeth says she asked Phillip. Claudia tells her, ""If you start to think of your marriage as real, it doesn't work. The men don't think of it that way. It was an arrangement."" Claudia tells Elizabeth that even after what they went through  and Elizabeth's attack on Claudia  she trusts her. Claudia says she's ""not so sure"" she trusts Phillip.

Elizabeth gets home and finds Phillip asleep on the couch. She stands over him for a moment and he wakes up. She tells him ""granny"" gave her some info on the killer, then says she's starting to get over the urge to kill Claudia. ""She's just doing her job, like the rest of us,"" Elizabeth says mysteriously.

FBI agents are poring through documents to try to track down the bomber. Amador is bored and wants to blow up the Russians. Gaad calls Beeman into his office. Gaad gives Beeman the keys to a safe house where he and his source (Nina) can have their meetings.

Elizabeth knocks on a door and tells the man of the house (his daughter had initially answered the door) that she knows who he is and what he does, and they need to discuss a few matters. The man tells his young daughter to go up to her room. Elizabeth tells him she needs him to violate his confidentiality because the alternative is ""bringing people down on you who will destroy your business."" He tells her she's making a serious mistake, and his daughter soon enters the room cocking and pointing a shotgun at Elizabeth. Soon enough, Phillip sneaks up and grabs the shotgun out of the girl's hand and sends her to watch some TV. The man describes the man  6-foot-4, light skin, a little chubby, ""friendly guy, actually."" He offers to show them pictures. He got pictures of them, too, when they went to his house.

We next see a man somewhat fitting the description who is watching some guys in suits go into a house. He's taking notes in German about the comings and goings.

Phillip is making our with Martha, his FBI contact, but he wants to talk business. She wants to have sex. So they do that. Phillip starts to talk about work. He starts talking about the scientist bombing. She asks if she can help by getting anything that Agent Gaad has on the case.

Nina shows up at the new safe house and Beeman greets her in Russian. Beeman starts to talk bout ""whatever happened"" the other day. She reminds him that she kissed him, and she kisses him again. And they start getting into it again. She thanks him for getting them a place to meet. She tells Beeman that Arkady is worried at work. She doesn't know what's going on but it seems serious. Beeman asks for more information, but there doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary. Beeman tells her he doesn't think he should've gotten her into this. He tells her he can get her out, but it ""takes some time."" She puts his hand on her breast and says, ""I do everything for you. I'm trying my best."" He hesitates and tries to say that's not what their affair is about, but she says she's there because that's where she wants to be.

We see the assassin sit next to a woman at a bar. She asks him what his ""thing"" is, and makes some sexual suggestions. He says he's ""much kinkier than that.""

Dinner at the Beemans' seems to have some awkward moments, with Phillip seemingly noticing some odd behavior from Elizabeth. Beeman gets a call from work and says he'll be there in about an hour.

Back at home, Phillip asks Elizabeth what's going on. She says she was thinking about when they first met and whether he remembers. He says he was surprised at how pretty she was, then clarifies he was more ""relieved"" than surprised. She tells him that ""granny"" said he slept with Irina. She reminds him that she asked him not to lie to her, and he told her to her face that nothing happened. Phillip looks down and says he's sorry.

""I didn't know what to say because I didn't want to lose you,"" he tells her. ""I love you.""

She looks at him skeptically and he goes on to say he made ""a terrible mistake,"" and asks if they can try and start over. She says they can't.

""We can do our jobs,"" she says. ""We can fulfill our mission, the reason we were brought to America. But we cannot do this. We will never do this."" She leaves.

The woman the assassin had been talking to is now having sex with one of the men in suits the assassin had been watching. She lures the man to the shower of their hotel room and the assassin walks in to survey the room. The man is an FBI agent, which we learn from seeing his badge on the nightstand. The assassin replaces the battery in the agent's radio with an explosive.

At the FBI, Gaad hands Martha some files and asks her to secure them, thanking her for putting in the extra time. After he leaves, she makes copies. She goes on to snoop for more info and Amador surprises her. He tells her she's been looking very nice lately and he's missed her since they broke up. He asks if they can get a drink some time, and she says, ""No, thank you."" She tells him he's sweet and handsome, ""deep down."" Then she leaves.

Arkady calls Nina into his office. He starts talking to her about some of the opportunities agents have to sell American goods back home to make some money. She tells him she thinks an assignment in America is a chance ""to really accomplish something,"" and adds, it's ""a dream come true.""

Phillip shows up at Martha's house. They're soon having sex again. He's not very into it, distracted by the necklace he gave her  which he'd taken from Elizabeth. Later, Martha gives Phillip the information on suspicious foreign nationals who've come through immigration in the last week, correlated with the hotels they're staying in. It's just what he needed.

Later, he and Elizabeth go through the documents and Phillip soon focuses in on the West German assassin.

We next see the assassin in his hotel room watching ""The Fall Guy."" Phillip and Elizabeth break into his room, pointing guns at him. He calmly asks who they are, figuring that if they were there to shoot him he'd already be dead. They explain that they are there to make sure he complies with the revocation of his assassination orders. He reveals a detonation device, which controls an explosive attached to the wall behind Phillip. He backs away toward the bathroom, pulling his own gun and telling them to put their guns down on the count of three. He gets to two before they shoot him. A gunfight ensues. Before the assassin can regain control of the detonator, Phillip tears the explosive off the wall, tosses it to Elizabeth, who tosses it into the bathroom. The assassin pushes the button, blowing himself to bits. Phillip and Elizabeth survey the scene, then leave.

They calmly walk out while chaos is unfolding at the hotel, and drive away as emergency vehicles are driving back in the opposite direction. Phillip says they can ""get past this, it doesn't have to be like this."" Elizabeth says, ""It is like this  we didn't take a vow to be unhappy.""

Nina shows up at the safe house to meet Beeman. She asks him what he did before counterintelligence. She suggests that FBI agents are ""cops, policemen in your hearts."" She says she wonders if they understand spies. She asks what he wants with Arkady and the others at the Rezidentura. He tells her she now reports to Arkady. She says she might be able to get files for him.

The FBI agent shows up to his shift to protect one of the scientists. The camera keenly focuses in on the agent's radio, which we know has an explosive in it. The agent from the previous shift goes to his car and waits for his partner. Soon after, the place blows up.

Martha looks worried as Gaad finishes a phone call at the FBI. He reports that Leon Billings was inside, too, and didn't survive.

""They're going to pay for this,"" Gaad say. ""I swear to God, they'll pay.""

Amador wants to know what's going to happen. He says they have planes and tanks, but no one is using them. Gaad says no one is going to war over this. Gaad adds that ""this will not stand.""

Elizabeth is doing some more decoding at home in her bedroom. She comes down to the kitchen and tells Phillip that the assassin got one of the scientists and three FBI agents, but doesn't know how. The center wants to know what happened. Phillip says they had bad information and still stopped him, but Elizabeth says they didn't stop him entirely. She says this is their biggest failure in 15 years. It's their job to stop things like this. She says they can't do their jobs if they're emotional. Phillip says emotion had nothing to do with it, but Elizabeth says her head was somewhere else. She says they were never married, ""we had an arrangement and it worked.""

Phillip tells her he tried. He remembers knowing she was disappointed when she first saw him. He starts to say that if they could change things he would, but Elizabeth tells him they can't change things. Phillip tells him that, given the fact that people get separated all the time, he doesn't think the Center would even care if she didn't want to be married to him anymore.

Gaad leaves the office, saying goodnight to Martha and Amador on the way. Martha leaves and Amador seems to be preparing to follow her.

That night, Phillip is sitting in the living room and hears footsteps. Elizabeth is upstairs, walking in the hallway and going to see her children, who are each sleeping in their rooms.

Martha gets home and Amador is watching."

Meanwhile, Phillip reconnected with his girlfriend from back in Russian, Irina, and lied to Elizabeth about having hooked up with her in New York. He asks her to give him another chance and Elizabeth says no.

'Safe House': The kids are enjoying a fried chicken dinner when Elizabeth brings up a serious subject. She announces that Phillip is ""going to be staying somewhere else for a little while."" Paige asks if they're separating, but Phillip clarifies that they're ""hitting the pause button."" Paige thinks it's a joke and Henry simply asks, ""Why?"" Elizabeth says they've been fighting a lot. The kids don't understand why they can't just stop fighting. Elizabeth says the important thing is that they need some time to figure things out. Henry asks if they don't love each other anymore and they say it's complicated. Henry asks if they're going to stop loving the kids. Paige is upset and tells Elizabeth it's her fault because she's ""always giving dad a rough time."" Phillip says it was a joint decision and Paige leaves.

Philip tries to talk to Henry, who's locked himself in his room and is crying. Phillip sits outside the door and tells Henry he loves him ""so much, more than you'll ever know."" Henry keeps crying and says nothing.

Phillip leaves and tells Elizabeth he'll see her the next night at the Beemans' house. Elizabeth is surprised Phillip wants to go together, but agrees they should when he reminds her that Stan's work friends are going to be there.

The next night at the party, Elizabeth tells Phillip that Paige slept in Henry's room and nobody is doing very well. He's staying at a motel, which she says is depressing. Elizabeth says ""it's for the best,"" and Henry says he knows. Elizabeth goes to mingle. In the living room, Gaad tells Stan and Amador, and a couple of others that he's planning to take out Arkady. He says it's voluntary and if anyone should ask it was not approved. Amador and another agent agree to join but Stan says that if it's ""extra-judicial"" he'd rather stay away.

Paige tells Matthew, Stan's son, about her parents' separation. Meanwhile, Amador talks to Stan a little about the Arkady job, but Stan says he's not into it. Then Amador turns his attention to Elizabeth, telling Stan she's ""a fox"" and saying he'd ""borrow some sugar"" if she was his neighbor. Stan calls him a putz.

Sandra, Stan's wife, tells Elizabeth she saw Phillip leave late the other night. Elizabeth explains that they're taking some time apart, and that they told the kids the previous night. Sandra tells her there's ""no shame"" in a separation and tells her not to hesitate to ask if she needs anything. Paige and Henry go to Phillip and ask him to come home, but he says he can't.

We next see Phillip having some serious sex with Martha, who calls him Clark. Later, he prepares to leave and she tells him she's in love with him. She says she's waited her whole life for him and would ""do anything"" for him. She says all he has to do is ask. She says, ""Just tell me one thing: Is this real?""

""Yes,"" he says. ""Yes.""

She asks him to stay with her, ""just this once."" He kisses her and doesn't resist when she takes his jacket off.

The next morning at the house, Henry hasn't come down for breakfast. Paige asks Elizabeth what she should tell her friends. Elizabeth says she should just tell the truth, that her parents aren't living together right now. At Martha's house, Martha brings Phillip breakfast in bed, saying she can ""get used to"" having a man sleeping in her bed. She has to get to work. She tells him Gaad got a call from the White House a couple of days ago and has since been having secret meetings ""with his old buddies from the CIA."" She thinks they're planning to kill a KGB agent, saying, ""it's an eye for an eye, Clark."" She kisses him and says he can stay as long as he likes.

After she leaves, Phillip jumps out of bed and gets moving quickly. As Phillip heads to his car, Amador comes up behind him, announcing himself as an FBI agent and asking Phillip who he is. Phillip says he's ""just a guy."" Amador tells Phillip to lock up his car so they can ""take this conversation downtown."" Phillip turns and kicks Amador in the gut, then kicks his gun out of his hand. They fight for a bit, then Amador pulls a knife. He lunges at Phillip with it, but Phillip turns it on Amador and pushes it into Amador's stomach. It's stuck there and Phillip hastily stuffs Amador into the trunk of his car.

Phillip is trying to treat Amador's wounds at a safe house when Elizabeth shows up. Phillip explains what happened and they both recognize him from the Beemans' party. Phillip also tells Elizabeth about the planned hit on a KGB agent and they realize Amador will know what they're planning. She has morphine and injects Amador with some. She's wearing a blonde bob wig.

At the FBI office, an agent asks Stan if he's seen Amador and he hasn't. He notes that it's ""not like him"" to be late. Stan calls Amador and gets his machine.

Back at the safe house, Phillip pulls the knife from Amador's stomach and it gushes while Amador screams in pain. They put some pressure on it and Elizabeth tells him, ""The hard part's over.""

Stan goes to Amador's apartment and finds it empty. He listens to Amador's messages. After a couple from random women and his mother, Stan hears the message he just left. He also notices that Amador has a picture of the two of them on an end table. Stan sees Amador's car outside of his apartment, which is where Phillip parked it after wiping the prints.

Stan goes to Gaad and tells him, noting that it was odd that there were no prints at all  even Amador's own on the car. Gaad says he's got every available agent out looking for Amador and they'll find him. He doesn't want to jump to conclusions about the KGB having him.

Elizabeth leaves to get the kids and Phillip stays with Amador.

Stan sits quietly at his desk and thinks about chats with Amador. He was proud of having ""no attachments,"" being a lone wolf.

Phillip is still next to Amador, who's struggling to breathe. Elizabeth gets home with groceries and a new wok to make Chinese food. Paige is annoyed and tells Elizabeth that she doesn't want to pretend her life is ""a do-over."" She wants things to be the way they were before. Elizabeth says she knows things are hard ""but it's for the best.""

""For who?"" Paige asks.

Elizabeth gets a call from Mrs. Costa, a teacher at Henry's school. She goes to talk to Henry and says she knows this ""is a terrible thing to do to you right now."" Mrs. Costa told Elizabeth that Henry didn't do his Social Studies project, but he says he did. She asks him to show it to her and he pulls a paper out of his backpack. It says, ""The Revolutionary War. America won."" He says that's it.

Stan picks up Nina and she goes in to kiss him but he doesn't react. She says the KGB wants to know what the FBI's next move is, knowing the FBI won't sit back after the scientist was killed. Stan asks her who took Amador, and grabs her arm and squeezes it hard. He tells her to find out  now. She leaves without saying anything.

Amador's eyes open just a bit and he asks Phillip for water. Phillip gets it and pours a bit into Amador's mouth.

""Cold,"" Amador says. Phillip puts a blanket on him. Amador asks Phillip what he wants. Phillip asks who the FBI is planning to take out. Amador says he doesn't know, but Phillip says, ""I think you do.""

Gaad talks to his small group, announcing that several of his friends from the CIA will be helping. Stan shows up. Arkady will be going on his regular run in one hour and they're planning to kill him in Danbury Park. An agent will be giving a signal by raising his newspaper. If the newspaper is dropped, the mission should be aborted.

Gaad goes up to Stan after the chat and says he's glad he showed up. Stan says that if they kill Arkady they're ""signing Amador's death certificate."" Gaad reminds Stan that Amador knows the name of Stan's contact in the KGB. If he talks, she's finished.

Elizabeth gives Phillip the family update as they walk down the hall to the place where Amador is laying. She says they need information on him now and goes in to give it her own try.

A KGB worker goes to get Arkady for their usual run, but Arkady isn't going. He burnt his hand on a microwaved potato and the doctors want to graft his skin. ""American technology,"" he quips.

Elizabeth stands over Amador and he says, ""We've met before."" She says she doesn't think so. He thinks they met at a bar, had too much to drink and screwed their brains out. He tells her he doesn't know anything about a hit, ""if I did, I'd tell you, baby. Scout's honor,"" he adds.

He tells her she's going to lose this war. He says she can torture and kill him, but they're going to kick her ""motherland's marbled ass, and there's nothing you can do about it.""

Arkady's would-be running partner is jogging through the park alone and the agent making the signal slams his newspaper in the trash. The signal is to abort, but Stan says, ""Screw that,"" and radios two other agents to grab the guy. They do.

Gaad isn't happy with Stan, but tells him to go ahead and interrogate the guy, adding, ""We'll get into this later."" Gaad leaves. In an empty apartment, Stan gets into the guy's head and threatens to kill him if he doesn't give up information on where Amador is, but the man cries and begs Stan to spare him because he's a diplomat and knows nothing.

Amador finally says, ""Arkady."" Elizabeth realizes the the resident is the target, but Amador says, ""Forget it, he's already dead.""

Stan, meanwhile, calls the Soviet Embassy from a pay phone and gets Arkady on the line. He says he has Vlad. Arkady says ""he's nobody"" and has nothing for him. Stan demands Amador be released, but Arkady says he doesn't know Amador.

Stan says that if anything happens to Amador, he'll kill Vlad.

Arkady hands Nina a note and tells her to find anything she can on someone named Amador. He says the FBI thinks the KGB has him. She asks if they do and he say he has no idea.

Arkady gets a call from Elizabeth, who doesn't announce herself but was identified by his secretary as a woman who ""had the emergency code."" He answers the phone and Elizabeth confirms it's him, then hangs up without saying anything.

Elizabeth and Phillip try to figure out why Amador would lie about Arkady. Phillip thinks he's lying to cover up something else. Elizabeth takes out her gun but Phillip says he'll handle it. They agree to pump Amador with morphine and let him drift off after he talks, but Phillip goes to get more information from him and finds Amador has died.

We next see a police scene around Amador's body, which appears to have to been dumped in some industrial area. Stan goes and sees his body. Gaad comes up and says he's going to pull every agent. Gaad says that whoever stabbed Amador went through the trouble to try to save him. Gaad thinks Amador might have given up Stan's contact, but Stan says he wouldn't have. He says he'd risk her life and his own on that assumption.

Stan sits alone drinking coffee and remembers a conversation with Amador about how Vietnam changed him. One of the things Amador learned there was that ""shame"" is one thing worse than dying. Stan's order at the place where he was waiting for food is ready. He brings it back to the apartment where Vlad is being held and hands Vlad a burger. He tells him to enjoy it. Vlad takes a bite.

Stan asks Vlad, frankly, if he's KGB. Vlad nods and says yes but adds that he doesn't know anything. Stan says he believes him. Stan sits back and talks about how good American fast food is, then asks Vlad if he wants something to drink. Stan gets up and walks toward the kitchen, behind Vlad, but then turns and in one motion pulls his gun and shoots Vlad in the back of the head."

Stan, at one point, spotted one of Gregory's crew in Philadelphia after the FBI lost a subject who was being surveilled (Gregory's crew kidnapped him for Phillip and Elizabeth). Stan wondered what ""some guy in the hood"" would care about a KGB spy. Phillip hooked up with his old girlfriend from Russia, and lied about it to Elizabeth, so they're now separated, or, ""hitting the pause button,"" as Phillip told the kids. Amador tracked Phillip at the home of Martha, an FBI employee who's been unwittingly giving Phillip secrets (she thinks he works for the Swiss government and they're having an affair). Amador wound up getting stabbed with his own knife while grappling with Phillip and dying. Stan demanded that Nina get intel on who has Amador, but, finding no one, he ended up killing Vlad  a guy Nina works with who really knew nothing about Amador.

'Only You:' Elizabeth brings Phillip back to his motel, saying, ""it doesn't look so bad."" Phillip tells her to let him know when she wants to switch (she's still living at their house). He tells her to go home and rest.

At the FBI, Agent Gaad says Amador's family is appreciative of their thoughts and there will be details on his funeral coming. He gives a speech about how good of an agent and man Amador was, and says, ""he did a lot for this department and for this country."" He vows to ""take every resource we have"" and ""hunt for whoever is responsible for what happened to him."" He says they won't rest until those responsible are behind bars, ""or, even better, until we zip them up in a body bag.""

Martha comes to Stan and tearfully tells him that Amador was just asking her out again the other night. She sends Stan to see Gaad in the vault. Stan wants to know where Amador's ring is, because he didn't have him. Gaad assures Stan that he's on his side and no one is accusing him of anything. Gaad tries to give Stan a pep talk and tells him ""don't think twice about what you did."" He tells him to go home and rest. He asks him to see what Nina knows the next day about Amador.

Stan visits Phillip's motel room and Phillip has no idea how he found him.

""If I can't find a travel agent staying in a motel under his own name, then I'm in the wrong line of business,"" Stan says, seeming a bit drunk and carrying a six pack into Phillip's room. Then he admits Elizabeth told Sandra, which seems to relive Phillip, who puts on some clothes (he was just getting out of the shower). Stan talks about how he spent a lot of time in crappy motel rooms like this one. Stan finally reveals that his partner was found dead. Stan says Chris Amador was ""a good guy."" Phillip asks what happened and Stan says ""bad guys"" stabbed him.

""We're gonna find them,"" Stan says. He gets up to leave and Phillip offers to drive Stan, who is clearly drunk, home. Stan refuses, insisting he's alright. He thanks Phillip and leaves.

The next morning, Stan asks Nina who killed Amador and she asks him who killed Vlad. He says he doesn't know. She says Vlad was her friend and this is ""a really bad day."" She insists that Vlad had no idea what was going on, adding, ""we don't kill FBI agents."" She says the KGB didn't know anything until ""somebody called threatening to kill Vlad if something happened to your partner."" (That was Stan who called). He again insists he doesn't know who killed Vlad, adding, ""we're not monsters, Nina."" He says he must know who killed Amador. She tells him Vlad never wanted to be KGB and joined to make his uncle happy. He really wanted to be a doctor and was going to leave the KGB the next year to go to medical school. She asks Stan again to find out what happened to Vlad because she wants to be able to tell his family something.

Elizabeth is scrambling to get the kids going in the morning, but Paige says, ""You're the one who wanted it this way."" Elizabeth doesn't like this and tells Paige she does not get to speak to her like that. Phillip shows up to take the kids to school. Elizabeth tells him not to make surprise appearances, ""especially when we are adjusting to new routines.""

Phillip tells Elizabeth that Amador's ring wasn't on his body. Elizabeth says she'll check with Gregory to find out what happened.

At the FBI, there's a hit on Amador's ring. A salvage yard owner tried to fence it at a pawn shop. Stan heads there with some other agents.

Elizabeth, meanwhile, calls Gregory from a pay phone. She taps the phone three times and he hangs up and leaves his apartment.

Stan talks to the salvage yard owner, who insists ""it's a fair trade"" if he finds items in the cars brought to his yard. Stan wants to know who brought the car and the salvage yard owner says it was just left. After being shown how the ring was lodged into a space deep inside the trunk, Stan realizes Amador left it for the FBI to track down. Stan asks the guy again who dropped the car, and Stan punches him in the stomach, then pins him down on the trunk of the car. The man insists he doesn't know names, but it was ""some black guys"" who drop cars with him now and then. Stan brings him to look at some mug books.

Elizabeth and Gregory meet at a bar and tells him that ""the guy"" (Amador) might have left his ring behind in the trunk of the car. Elizabeth tells Gregory about her separation from Phillip. He puts a hand on her head and she says she's ""can't"" because she's ""a mess right now."" She assures him the whole thing will blow over, but to stay out of sight and keep checking his signals.

The salvage yard guy looks through the mug books and eventually picks out a face. It's Curtis Leroy Lyons, the guy Stan once saw in Philadelphia. He brings this to Gaad.

We next see a SWAT team going up a stairwell with Stan following behind. They bust into an apartment and chaos ensues. A chase begins with Curtis running for it on the street. He's eventually caught. Stan looks at him and tells him, ""You should've let me catch you the first time. I'm upset now."" The other officers take Curtis away.

Claudia gets into a car to talk to Elizabeth and Phillip, who report that the FBI picked up a member of Gregory's team. She tells them to put Gregory in a safe house. Phillip questions Gregory's loyalty while Elizabeth insists Gregory would be loyal. Claudia says Gregory could be shipped to Moscow. She also mentions the less preferable option.

Stan questions Curtis, who refuses to talk. Stan says he couldn't care less about drugs, but Curtis says he isn't dumb. Stan tells Curtis about Amador being killed and he says he feels ""like revenge."" He says he is pretty sure the Russians killed him. He tells Curtis to wait for his lawyer if he's working with then Russians, because he will have committed treason. Stan tells Curtis they don't have much in common, but they're both ""Americans,"" right? Curtis says nothing.

Elizabeth meets with Gregory that the plans to take care of him are being put in motion, and Gregory knows the plan is Moscow. He asks her to get him in L.A. He says that if she ""asked them"" it could happen. Elizabeth says nothing and Gregory starts to leave. He then asks if the two of them can ""get out of here,"" and she says she can't. He leaves.

Gaad is briefing FBI agents on Gregory Thomas. He gives the background on the possibility that the KGB recruited civil rights activists like Gregory.

We next see Claudia arrive at Gregory's house. We see FBI and SWAT team members going through what appears to be Gregory's place while we hear Claudia telling Gregory that they'd do whatever they could to make it easier on Gregory, but they can't. Claudia tells her she can't ""take any chances."" She says he's ""been brilliant, a hero"" and his reward is waiting. She tells him the FBI will follow him to the ends of the Earth. She tells him they've left evidence at his apartment linking him to Amador's murder. When the trail stops with him, they won't have to worry about it getting to Phillip and Elizabeth. She calls this Gregory's ""final act of service."" (Meanwhile, we see the FBI finding traces of Amador's blood on a pair of Gregory's shoes in his apartment).

Gregory tells Claudia he ""won't take to Moscow."" He says he's never wanted too much, he ""just wanted to live for something, and I've done that. And to know when I'm done. Now I'm done.""

Claudia comes out into the hallway and tells Phillip that they need to get him to Moscow. They discuss this a bit and Claudia tells Gregory, ""If this ends the hard way, I don't want her to have to do it,"" referring to Elizabeth, because Gregory was her first recruit. She asks Phillip if he'll be there, and he says he will.

Stan tells his wife, Sandra, they know who killed Amador. He says they don't have him yet, but they will. Stan starts to open up to Sandra, telling her that most agents never pull the trigger, but that hasn't been his destiny. He tells her she doesn't know everything, and adds, ""the world that we live in is a little darker and a little uglier than I think you know, so sometimes...."" He trails off and doesn't finish. She suggests that they get out of it all, saying their family is all that matters and they could leave everything else behind.

Gregory and Elizabeth are laughing while eating Chinese food. He tells her about Claudia and asks if Claudia could really stop him if he tried to flee. Gregory pulls Elizabeth onto the couch and tells her not to take Phillip back, but instead to find someone who will love her for being as strong as she is. Then they start to make out, and probably more.

The next morning, Phillip leaves his motel room, carrying his gun in his waistband. Elizabeth is still with Gregory and packing. He says he's not going with her. He tells her he's going to walk outside, ""find some men with guns"" and put an end to this whole thing so that she and Phillip can continue with their mission. She tries to convince him to give Moscow a chance. He says he isn't changing her mind. He starts to walk out and she says she can't let him leave that way, holding her gun and pointing it at him. He walks toward her until the gun is touching his chest. Phillip arrives and when Elizabeth tells him Gregory's plan to get the cops to shoot him dead, Phillip tells Elizabeth to wait outside. Phillip pulls his gun out and puts a silencer on it. Elizabeth drops her gun and tells Phillip she trusts Gregory to do what he says.

""We owe him this,"" Elizabeth says. Phillip thinks it's a bad idea. She asks him to please trust in her trust in Gregory. Phillip steps back and holds his gun on a counter. Gregory gives Elizabeth a kiss on the head and leaves without saying a word walking right by Phillip on his way out.

We see Phillip and Elizabeth walk to their separate cars and Phillip nods at her. They drive away in opposite directions.

We see Gregory walking the streets, right by a cop who immediately gets on his radio.

Meanwhile, Phillip gets back to his motel and Elizabeth gets back to her empty house.

Gregory is still walking as he starts to realize he's becoming surrounded by cops. He crouches behind a car and pulls a gun to shoot at the cops, who start shooting back. He hits at least one as the bullets fly in silent slow motion. Gregory is soon enough hit by three bullets and falls backward. In a new part of the montage, we see Arkady and Nina stand next to each other as Vlad's casket is taken away.

Elizabeth watches a news report about Gregory's shootout with cops. She turns it off. Phillip eats pizza alone in his motel room, and Stan looks at a picture of Gregory's dead body sitting on his desk."

A couple of U.S. scientists were assassinated by a Russian-backed hit man before Phillip and Elizabeth could stop him. Stan's partner, Agent Chris Amador, was killed and Stan avenged his death by murdering a KGB agent, Nina's friend, Vlad. She's asked him who killed Vlad and he says he doesn't know. Phillip and Elizabeth are separated.

'Covert War:' Special Agent ib Charge Gaad (Richard Thomas) briefs his team that three high-level KGB officers are being targeted in Moscow, including Viktor Zhukov (Olek Krupa), the head of Directorate S. We see Zhukov at home when someone shows up unexpected. The intruder kills Zhukov's guard and, after a brief struggles, shoots Zhukov twice, dead.

Elizabeth and Stan's wife Sandra (Susan Misner) go out for a girl's night. They're drinking at a bar when Sandra asks Elizabeth if she's ever dated anyone from a foreign country. Elizabeth says no. Sandra says she dated a visiting professor from Finland in college. She says the professor was the first of two she's ever slept with. Sandra then asks Elizabeth if she's ever thought about cheating.

Phillip, meanwhile, has the kids for the night and they watch ""Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom (1963).""

Elizabeth and Sandra are dancing at the bar when Sandra slips away to call home. She checks on her son, who tells her that Stan is working late.

Phillip and the kids go out to the vending machines at the motel and see a guy urinating in the parking lot. Phillip suggests to him that he ""pack it up,"" and the guy obliges while the kids giggle.

Later that night, Stan gets home and finds Sandra crying and drunk. She tells him she called headquarters and they said he'd left hours earlier. He says they were mistaken and she calls ""BS"" on him. She calls him a liar and goes off on him about how he's become ""the opposite of the man that I married."" She tells him she's sick of kidding herself about him and their marriage.

Claudia (Margo Martindale) gives Elizabeth the news that Zhukov is dead. She demands to know who did it. Claudia says the CIA Director of Planning for the Soviet Union Richard Patterson (Paul Fitzgerald) was the architect of the operation and Elizabeth says, ""He has to die."" Claudia says there will be no retribution from them, per Moscow's orders. They don't want to let it spiral out of control. Elizabeth says Moscow is wrong. Claudia says she doesn't agree or disagree, ""I follow orders."" Claudia warns Elizabeth not to disobey orders and tells her that Zhukov would want Elizabeth to do the right thing.

Elizabeth flashes back to 1964, when then-Colonel Zhukov gave her a pep talk about the chances she was dealing with and about Phillip, and love.

Elizabeth tells Phillip the news about Zhukov and says she's going to find the man responsible and kill him. Phillip asks if those are the orders, but she doesn't say yes. She says she's going to make sure ""they"" know they can't get away with such an action.

Elizabeth has been doing research on Patterson and his routines. She gives Phillip all the info and he encourages her to let it go. She realizes that Patterson's weakness is women and she can grab him at a place called The Wheelhouse. Phillip tells her they shouldn't disobey orders again. He tells her that if she wants to kill him, she should put a scope on a rifle and take him out. She makes it clear, though, that she wants to look him in the eyes before she kills him.

Stan is home when his son, Matt, gets back from seeing ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)."" Stan is surprised to see Matt is wearing makeup, but Matt tells him it's a drag show and everyone wears makeup, ""and, no, it doesn't mean I'm gay.""

Arkady (Lev Gorn) finds Nina with her feet up on her desk in her new office. She's now a senior lieutenant. He tells her that he's planted a bug at the house of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. He wants her to scour FBI communications for any meetings at Weinberger's library because he wants to know anything that is said about the hits in Russia.

Phillip gets to Martha's (Alison Wright) house and she wants to introduce him to her parents (Peggy J. Scott and Richard Kline). He stays to chat for a bit, but leaves quickly while claiming he has work stuff to do. He leaves but first tells her that her parents are lovely and kisses her.

Flash back to Geneva in 1971 when Elizabeth told Zhukov that she was pregnant with her second child. She hadn't yet told Phillip. Zhukov told Elizabeth about his dog dying.

Phillip meets up with Elizabeth as she prepares to make her move to grab Patterson. He says he'll give her 20 minutes before pulling the car around to the alley. She leaves.

Inside The Wheelhouse, the bar Patterson frequents, Elizabeth flirts with Patterson about his choice on the jukebox. She says she just broke up with her boyfriend. She toasts ""to being free and easy,"" but he says he isn't ""easy."" She teases him with some crossword puzzle clues and lures him to the restroom to have sex. She tries to jam a syringe in his leg while he's groping her, but he notices and they tussle for a bit. He starts to choke against a wall, but knees him in the groin to push him off, then knocks him out with a blow to the head using the paper towel dispenser. She opens the bathroom window and Phillip is there to help drag Patterson through it.

Stan meets Nina at their safe house and she asks him again to tell her the story of who murdered Vlad. He says they might never really know what happened. ""It's frustrating,"" he says, but she suggests a different word and asks him what he wants from her. He tells her ""this part of things should stop,"" referring to their affair. He starts to say it's not what he wants, but says ""it's the right thing to do."" She says, ""Okay."" She tells him she no longer has anything... no country or family to go back to. ""I only have fear and you,"" she says. He tells her that his wife knows about the affair and Nina says, ""Family is everything.""

She steps away and slips off her robe, putting her bra back on, but Stan comes up behind her and takes it off again. It doesn't look like ""this part of things"" is stopping.

Patterson is blindfolded and chained to a chair in an empty warehouse space as Elizabeth walks around him playing mind games with him. She asks him, ""How does it feel to be alive, but knowing you're going to die, you just don't know exactly when?""

He offers information and money, but she declines both. She says she wants to know how it feels to order the deaths of innocent people. He tells her those Soviet generals were not innocent, ""they knew the risks,"" and that he is just a bureaucrat who executes orders. He decides nothing, he says, before telling her that she is just a killer with ""no heart, no soul, no conscience."" He asks her if she cares about anything or loves anyone, and she screams at him to stop talking. She fires the gun away from his head and walks out of the room where she breaks down crying. Phillip comes in and asks what happened. He takes the gun and says he'll kill Patterson, but she says it's ""not about him.""

""I was out of control,"" she says.

Phillip comforts her and tells her, ""It's okay. It happens."" She says nothing and walks out.

We next see Patterson still blindfolded and seated on a public bench. Elizabeth is watching from her car across the street before driving away.

Patterson is debriefed by Gaad, Stan and others at the FBI. He tells them about where he was taken and Gaad asked what he was doing in the restroom. Patterson says he was going to have sex with her, but she was attacked and had help. He says her intent to kill him ""was personal"" and based on the killing of the agents in Russia. He can't figure out why she let him go.

""So,"" Gaad recounts. ""A woman and a man?""

""Yes,"" Patterson confirms. ""A couple.""

Flash back to Rome in 1976, where Zhukov is telling Elizabeth how much he loves it there. He asks about Phillip and she says things are the ""same."" He told her she was chosen for America because of her fear of surrender. He told her he had no more stories to tell her, that he lost his way a long time ago and has lived for his work and ""now I miss what I never had.""

Elizabeth shows up at Phillip's motel room to tell him ""thanks a lot."" She brought beer. He invites her in. He has some things packed up and he says he can't stay there anymore. He doesn't want to bring the kids back there. They start to agree that the kids need to feel more rooted. Elizabeth says the separation was the right thing to do, but she's clearly upset when Phillip tells her he got an apartment. She leaves in a hurry and leaves her car with him (his battery was dead), rushing off to take the bus home.

Elizabeth meets Claudia in her car and asks Claudia why she told her about Patterson and then told her not to act on it. Elizabeth knows Claudia wanted her to kill him, but tells Claudia that she let him go. Claudia tells Elizabeth she wasn't the only one who loved Zhukov. Claudia claims she and Zhukov were in love, but Elizabeth doesn't believe her. She thinks Claudia was trying to set her up to disobey orders so she could be shipped back to Moscow. Claudia tells Elizabeth that her job is to help her and Phillip, but Elizabeth insists that she's only acted to hurt them. She wonders why Claudia hates them.

""Because we're better at this than you ever were?"" Elizabeth asks. ""Because I beat your face in?""

""You're still new at this, my dear,"" Claudia says, stone faced. ""So much to learn.""

""This isn't going to go well for you, old lady,"" Elizabeth says, looking Claudia squarely in the eyes before getting out of the car and walking away."

Meanwhile, Martha, his FBI contact , is falling for him and introduced him to her parents. Stan started an affair with Nina, his KGB source. Phillip and Elizabeth's marriage is falling apart and they're separating. The kids aren't happy. Stan killed a KGB office worker named Vlad  a friend of Nina's  to avenge the killing of his partner, but he claims to Nina that he doesn't know who killed Vlad. Elizabeth got some info from a source named Sanford about a ""breakthrough"" by a team at Livermore labs.

'The Oath': Sanford meets with Elizabeth to tell her he recruited someone, a colonel in the Air Force intelligence. He says he did it the way Adam Dorwin recruited him, but Elizabeth tells him Dorwin followed their instructions throughout. He offers some information for $50,000. She tells him she needs to know what she's buying.

Arkady calls Nina in and asks her to help with the instruction of Directorate S. He asks her to read ""the oath"" that, among other things, vows that she'd be willing to die before revealing any of the secrets entrusted to her. He places a pin on her lapel.

Phillip warns Elizabeth that ""gamblers are unreliable,"" referring to Sanford. She thinks Sanford could have landed them their highest source in the Reagan administration, but he's worried they might be getting set up. They talk about their living arrangements and the kids. Phillip asks Elizabeth if she's OK with it and she says ""absolutely.""

In Caspar Weinberger's home office, we see his maid take a look at the clock in which she planted a listening device.

Elizabeth goes to a sketchy part of town and sees Sanford's signal that he's dropped something for her. She grabs a jar from the hood of a car and bring it home to examine it. She peels back a corner of what looks to be a post card and finds a tiny chip that shows some schematics for the U.S. missile defense system.

Weinberger's maid is in church looking stressed as the pastor gives her sermon.

Claudia intently plays Pac-Man when Elizabeth shows up at a restaurant to meet her. Claudia says Elizabeth's info from the colonel is ""10 years ahead"" of anything they'd already had in the field. She thinks U.S. intelligence wouldn't give up anything that valuable as a trap, so the colonel must be real. Claudia says Sanford doesn't strike her as the type that would turn them in. Claudia says the colonel has set the meeting time and that a trap is always a possibility, but it's worth the risk.

Elizabeth goes back to Phillip and complains about Claudia. She wants her gone. Phillip suggests they put a bug in Agent Gaad's office to find out if they're running an operation. He says Martha will plant it. Elizabeth isn't so sure.

Claudia is packing Vlad's things and she and another woman talk about him a bit. The other woman tells Nina that Vlad had a crush on Nina, but he knew that she was out of his league.

Phillip and Paige are having fun tossing grapes into each other's mouths when Elizabeth knocks. Paige seems a little bummed to have to leave. Phillip then rushes off to meet with Martha. At dinner, they talk about a trip Phillip wants to take with her. He orders champagne. He tells her to close her eyes, then traces in the palm of her hand, ""Marry me."" She excitedly says yes and they toast and drink.

Nina meets Stan at their safe house. She tells Stan that Sonia met a deputy chief at the French embassy and Arkady thinks the diplomat is ""vulnerable."" They hug, then she starts to take her clothes off and tells Stan she had a dream about him. She was in a burning building, maybe the Rezidentura, and then he showed up. She doesn't know if he saved her, though. She woke up, was safe and he was gone.

""It was you,"" she says, as Stan is kissing her nearly naked body. ""Did you kill Vlad?""

He tells her he would ""never do anything"" to hurt her. She continues kissing him.

Back at her place, Martha tells Phillip (who she thinks is named Clark) that she wants to take his name. He tells her she can't and there's no need. She notices his ""Martha, I need to ask you something important"" look on his face. He asks her to place a pen (which includes a listening device) in Gaad's office the next time he's out. He asks her to keep the other end of the transmitter with her because he'll need to check it when they meet. She asks him to assure her that everything's going to be alright. She tells him she trusts him and loves him.

Weinberger's maid, Viola, is in his study again. She pulls Weinberger's wife aside to talk privately. We next see her revealing the information about the bug to Gaad and Stan at the FBI. She said she was afraid for her son, Grayson, whose life was being threatened. Stan asks her if she's be OK with him calling in a sketch artist. Outside the room, Stan notes to Gaad that it's ""no coincidence"" that the CIA agent who was kidnapped at The Wheelhouse bar was also taken by a couple.

Paige is at Matt's house watching his band practice when another girl named Sarah shows up. She plays guitar and Paige gets jealous. Later that night, Paige tells Elizabeth about it. Elizabeth assures her daughter that ""we see what we need to see in people  things that aren't really there."" Paige asks if that's what happened with Elizabeth and Phillip, but Elizabeth says no.

A technician checks the bug in Weinberger's office with Weinberger's wife watching. He confirms it works, and Gaad says they're going to leave it. ""Now that we know they're listening, we'll know what to say,"" Gaad tells Weinberger's worried wife.

Gaad startles Martha as she brings some papers into his office. He leaves and she takes the opportunity to drop the pen in his office.

That night, she calls Phillip over to her place. She's made a pro-con list about their relationship and tells him it's odd that she can't even tell her parents about them. He tells her he could go to jail if their relationship were revealed. He tells her ""no one can know about this  not for the foreseeable future, anyway."" She says she can't do this if she can't tell her parents, then he relents and says it's OK to tell them if they can trust them. She says she doesn't want to wait and wants to get married that weekend.

Elizabeth and Phillip listen to some of Gaad's conversation and there's no mention of an operation to trap them. He also tells her the wedding is the next day and he needs her to be there and pose as his family.

Sanford is frisked by a cop as he heads to his car on a snowy night. Claudia tells Elizabeth the next day that he was arrested by local cops for failure to pay child support. Elizabeth worries about going into the meeting with the colonel while Sanford is locked up. Claudia is annoyed that Elizabeth went over her head to confirm the orders to meet with the colonel. This conversation happens as they're waiting for the wedding to happen. Phillip brings Martha to meet his ""mother"" and ""sister.""

The wedding happens and congratulations are passed around. Elizabeth quietly says, ""That was beautiful."" She later tells Phillip that it was ""touching,"" and is serious. She says she didn't expect it to be. She notes that he and she were ""never really married."" She asks him if things would have been different between them if they'd said those words. He says he doesn't know.

Gaad shows sketches of the couple that abducted the CIA agent (Patterson) and who poisoned Viola's son to Stan and other agents. One agent thinks the sketches of Elizabeth are two different women, but Stan says the differences are superficial. Gaad says they're looking for a caucasian man and woman in their 30s or 40s. Stan says he's certain the same couple abducted Patterson and poisoned Viola's son.

Nina drops in to Arkady's office at night. She announces that she's been spying for the Americans. She admits to having sent things back home and was turned in exchange for avoiding trouble. He asks if she's the mole and she says, ""Yeah.""

She tells him she deserves to be sent home and punished for her crime. He asks why she's telling him now and she admits that the FBI agent who turned her as become her lover. She tells him he can kill her, ""or let me redeem myself in the eyes of our beloved Russia."""

Zhukov  Elizabeth and Phillip's boss back in Moscow  was assassinated. A guy named Patterson at the CIA was said to have given the order. Claudia gave Elizabeth Patterson's name but Elizabeth didn't kill him. Instead, she let him go. Claudia claimed that she loved Zhukov, but Elizabeth doesn't believe it. Nina, a KGB worker, became a spy for the Americans when Agent Stan Beeman threatened to turn her in for some illegal selling of black market items. Nina confessed to her boss, Arkady, that she's been spying for the U.S. Meanwhile, Phillip and Elizabeth's marriage has been rocky. A contact with a gambling problem, Sanford, brought Elizabeth information about a colonel who has access to secrets and will share them for a price. Claudia has set up a meeting, acknowledge that there's risk it's a set up but it's worth it. Phillip has had Martha his contact in the FBI  to bug Agent Gaad's office to find out if a set up is in the works. Phillip ""married"" Martha  who thinks his name is Clark and he is an Internal Affairs agent overseeing the FBI. Elizabeth was there and wondered what might have been if she and Phillip had really been married. Sanford was arrested for failure to pay child support and Elizabeth is worried that he'll be broken and outed as a spy for the Russians.

'The Colonel': Stan is questioning Sanford, who doesn't understand why the FBI is involved. Stan tells him foreign countries often target people who are behind on child support and assures him he'll get it straightened out in an hour. Stan comes back and tells Gaad that Sanford is ""holding back."" Stan suggests that instead of doing anything in one hour, they should leave Sanford in the interview room until he starts ""shouting at the glass that he wants to talk.""

After sex, Martha and Phillip (who she calls Clark) lay in bed and she suggests they redecorate now that they're married. He says the place is perfect.

Elizabeth meets Claudia at a breakfast place. Elizabeth is worried about a set up. Claudia reveals that Sanford has been moved to federal custody. Elizabeth is more worried now, and Claudia understands. Claudia also tells Elizabeth that they picked up information about a big, hurried meeting Caspar Weinberger will be having with James Bakker  from the bug that was place din Weinberger's study. We know the FBI now knows about the bug and is controlling what the Russians hear through it. Claudia tells Elizabeth she heard from The Center that Elizabeth and Phillip had requested she be replaced. This leads to another showdown-style chat between the two women, with Elizabeth telling Claudia she doesn't know people at all and Claudia retorting that she knows Elizabeth better than she knows herself and adding, ""And you don't know me at all.""

Elizabeth comes back to see Phillip in their travel office. She's worried the meeting with the colonel is a set up. Phillip tells her the Gaad bug is revealing nothing. Elizabeth warns Philip that if her meeting goes bad, he needs to get out of town with the kids. She's worried that as soon as Stan gets a look at her they'll know. Phillip says he should go meet the colonel. Elizabeth tells him he needs to get the tape from Weinberger's meeting with Bakker at the same time, but he says she can do it. Elizabeth tells Phillip she understands what he's trying to do, but that the kids would be better of with him. She says the colonel is her mission.

An FBI tech shows Stan and Gaad how the bug in Weinberger's office is working and how the receiver is in a car that gets parked nearby. Stan then looks closely at the sketches they have of what he doesn't know yet are Phillip and Elizabeth.

Arkady tells Nina he's spoken to Moscow and they've agreed not to sentence her to death because she came clear. He says they were skeptical of her offer to keep working and redeem herself. He told them, though, that he has a strong instinct about her. He thinks she could ""be quite effective with the American."" She says she ""will do everything"" she can. He tells her she will need to be careful, and that if she betrays them again there will be no leniency. He tells her to continue her relationship with Stan and she may be asked to plant something on him, but the ultimate goal is to turn him. She says she doesn't think he can be turned and Arkady replies that a man who did what Stan has done to her ""is weaker and more vulnerable than he seems.""

Gaad explains the Weinberger meeting mission to some agents. They're going to be waiting for the Directorate S illegal who comes to pick up the tape of the meeting.

Phillip gets to the house and Henry doesn't want to have dinner with Phillip and Paige. Phillip decides to stay at the house for dinner.

Stan tells Gaad he thinks the Weinberger mission is going to work. Stan says they'll need to do right by their source. Gaad says he'll have a conversation after the mission is done.

Back at the house, Phillip and Elizabeth sneak over to the kitchen and make their plans in case Phillip has to take the kids off to a state park up north. If she gets out of her meeting, she'll meet them. If not, Phillip has to take the kids to Canada. Phillip tries once more to convince Elizabeth that he should go to the meeting, but she insists they have to follow orders. He agrees not to fight her on it.

That night, Stan surprises his wife Sandra with a vacation to Jamaica, but she doesn't want to go. He says that the next day the case that's been consuming so much time will be over. He says he knows she's had to hear the same old thing so many times, but that some sun and ocean could help. She says she appreciates it, ""but, no, it's not going to fix anything. Sorry.""

Elizabeth sneaks into Henry's room while he's sleeping and kisses him softly on the forehead. We next see her listening to an old tape from her mother, telling her about her uncle's ailing health and about how she's seen pictures of Elizabeth (who she calls Nadezhda) and her family. She said that even though she'd never meet them, she considers them her family, too.

Claudia knocks on an apartment door and pretends to be a clumsy friend of his neighbor who needs to use the phone because she forgot to bring the neighbor's keys. It's Patterson's apartment she knocked on. He's suspicious and makes the phone call himself, eventually letting her in but slipping a gun into his waistline on his back. She comes in and starts chatting on the phone while Patterson watches her. He averts his eyes for a moment and she hits him with a taser, shocking him into submission before he has a moment reach for his gun. She injects him with something that will keep him immobile for 20 minutes, then slowly and matter-of-factly cuts his jugular with a small blade and tells him that's ""10 minutes longer than you have left."" As he bleeds out, she holds up a picture of Gen. Zhukov and tells him about how much of a friend he was.

Paige wakes Henry up to tell him she had a nightmare and is going to wake up Elizabeth. Henry tells her, ""No, you're not allowed and you know that."" Paige goes toward Elizabeth's room anyway and knocks. Hearing nothing, she opens the door and Elizabeth isn't there. Paige finds Elizabeth coming out of the laundry room, where she'd been listening to the tape. Paige doesn't believe she was doing laundry. Elizabeth says she was folding and tells Paige to go back up to bed.

Gaad sends his agents out toward Weinberger's house.

Arkady meets with Claudia in her car and he tells her she's being reassigned in a couple of days. Claudia then tells Arkady that every instinct she has is telling her this meeting with the colonel is a set up. She tells him to get Phillip and Elizabeth out of it. He wonders why she cares since they just stabbed her in the back. She says that as long as she has this job, she's responsible for her officers. She reminds him he's responsible for them, too. She urges him to call it off, but he says that if she's wrong, they'd be giving up their greatest potential success ""since we got the atom bomb.""

""That's what we always say just before our people die,"" Claudia says. Adding, ""Then next thing we say is, 'It was so obvious'""

At the travel office, Elizabeth and Phillip share a quick moment and look at each other.

Stan meets with Nina and tells her he can't say much, but in a few hours there will be some ""very, very happy people at the FBI"" and they are going to approve her exfiltration. She's surprised by this development. They share a tender moment with Stan saying he promised he'd get her ""to the other side of this.""

Phillip has left the office and another worker hands Elizabeth a note that reads, ""I did it the way I wanted. Don't forget the pick up. See you later, I hope.""

Nina sits alone in her FBI-provided safe house and finally gets up to leave. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is preparing for the pick up. She stops to look at a picture of her family before leaving the office. Stan gets to the Weinberger location and Gaad tells him he was right about Sanford  he started shouting at the glass and wants immunity and $500,000. Stan says they should make the deal.

Phillip is driving out to the meeting with the colonel.

Nina is reporting back to Arkady about Stan's comment that the FBI would be very happy. She thinks the colonel meeting is a set up. He picks up the phone.

FBI agents watch a woman walk past the car where the bug receiver is planted.

Meanwhile, Arkady is spray painting an ""abort"" signal on the sides of some Russian cars. He tells another worker he doesn't care what the FBI will think of their spray-painted cars, this is the only way to get the signal out on such short notice. We see Elizabeth, in disguise, on a bus.

Phillip drives right by one of the cars that had the abort signal on it. Claudia sees him reach what seems to be the meeting location.

Phillip walks up and meets with the colonel, sitting next to him on a bench in a park. Phillip tells the colonel that what he sent was ""incredible."" The colonel plays with the Latin origins in the word, saying the whole plan is ""not credible,"" it's at least 50 years from being useful. The colonel goes on about how crazy the arms race could get. Claudia sees one of the cars with the abort signal on it and drives straight into the park and confronts Phillip and the colonel, declaring the whole thing is a set up. The colonel doesn't believe it and now suspects Phillip of having told someone. Claudia says they wouldn't have sent the signal unless they were sure. Phillip looks around and says there's nobody there, then Claudia realizes, ""This isn't the set up."" Phillip figures out Elizabeth is in trouble and starts running.

The car with the bug receiver sits alone while FBI agents watch from every angle.

Phillip is speeding and making dangerous passes on the streets to get there quickly.

Elizabeth is now walking toward the car and Gaad radios to his agents to wait until someone opens the car or gets in.

Just as Elizabeth is close to the car, Phillip drives up next to her and shouts at her to get in. Stan realizes it's ""the couple"" the FBI has been looking for and calls to all the agents to get them.

Agents move in from every angle and appear to have Phillip and Elizabeth boxed in, with two cars behind Phillip and Elizabeth's car and armed agents with guns drawn  including Stan squarely in front of the car  in front of them. Phillip throws the car in reverse and Stan starts shooting. Phillip splits the two cars that were forming the blockade. He gets by them and takes off, with Gaad shouting for all the cars to get on their tails.

A car chase ensues, with Gaad and Stan calling out directions and locations to be blocked by other FBI agents. Phillip, however, turns into a parking garage and loses the FBI pursuit. They steal another car, leaving behind the one the agents were chasing, and remove their disguises. They drive slowly and calmly through the streets while seeing more FBI agents with sirens blaring.

Elizabeth tells Phillip, ""We should still take the kids to that hotel tonight. It'd be nice."" Phillip says OK, but looks at Elizabeth and sees something's not right. She's been shot in the stomach.

Stan finds Nina at the safe house. She's taken a bath, she says, smiling, to start her ""new life."" Stan tells her it didn't work out. ""It all fell apart,"" he says. She acts shocked and says she can't go back there. He apologizes and says he's going to take care of this for her, ""just, not yet.""

She comes to him and comforts him. She kisses him and tells him she knows he'll take care of it.

A doctor pulls the bullet from Elizabeth's stomach in a makeshift operating room, asking Phillip for help to stop the bleeding. Claudia watches, too. Afterward, Claudia tells Phillip he should go home to stay with the kids, but Phillip insists he's not leaving her.

We next see Phillip on the phone telling Stan that Elizabeth's great aunt took a fall and he and Elizabeth are headed up to help take care of her. Stan says he and Sandra will watch the kids.

In a season-ending montage, we see Martha get home and giddily put on her wedding ring (which she can't wear in public because ""Clark"" can't have people knowing he's married to a contact); Gaad shows Sanford the colonel's file and Sanford is talking; Nina is handing Arkady a file on Stan; and Phillip and Elizabeth's kids are at Stan's house.

Elizabeth wakes up and finds Phillip next to her. He holds her hand. She tells him in Russian, ""Come home."" He says nothing and holds her hand to his lips.

Paige has gone home to get her homework and she stops at the laundry room door, going in to see what it's all about. She snoops around and doesn't see much more than folded clothes, but there's more going on and she seems to know it."

The assassin gets the information and kills the guy. The deadly marital arts assassin can kill in the blink of an eye. The case moves from there as the assassin tracks the vase and Magnum is hired by a Chinese antiques dealer who currently owns the vase.

Magnum flies (on TCs helicopter) to the island where the antiques dealer lives and has the shop. She runs the shop with another. She travels back with Magnum to the estate where she awaits the time to transfer the vase. As they leave the shop, the assassin visits the store and starts to destroy the shop as he tries to get the new location out of the other shop dealer. The shop dealer talks and then is killed.

At the estate, Mai Ling talks to Higgins in her native tongue. Higgins wants to view the vase, but due to its value, she does not want to open it. It is locked in a safe.

The assassin tracks down TC; TC is attacked but not killed since there are other people around.

Magnum and Mai Ling visit with Rick. During the visit, Magnum gets word that TC is hurt. Rick and Magnum tend to the wounds and TC explains how the guy moves and acts. It seems that Mai Ling is aware of who the person is as she mentions Tong. She realizes she must get to her uncle. She explains the history of the tong (assassin).

Magnum and Mai Ling travel to her uncle. There she plans to stay until her cousin arrives and she can give the cousin the vase. As Magnum drives away, his seventh sense kicks in and he returns to the uncle's place. Mai Ling was kidnapped and the ransom was the Soul of Sung.

Magnum works out a place with TC and Rick's help to save Mai Ling and get the vase back. Mai Ling was left on the beach in the hot sun, drugged and dehydrated. As he helps her, Rick and TC are tracking the vase. The assassin breaks the vase and Rick and TC get away.

Higgins looks at the broken vase pieces and realizes it is a reproduction and not the original.

As the story continues, Magnum realizes that Mai Ling was not planting flowers at a cemetery, but rather was hiding the vase. He and TC head there; the assassin and Mai Ling's cousin are also there. A fight ensues. Magnum gets his gun and the tong starts to use his deadly hands. Magnum shoots.

The vase is returned with the cousin. Mai Ling is safe."

Blood drips from one of his hands.

The next morning Beth Latimer wakes up late after all the clocks in her house stop. As she races to get her husband Mark and daughter Chloe out of the house she inquires about their son Danny but Mark says that the boy must have already left to do his paper route as he hasn't seen him. Chloe tries to beg off going to school, saying she's sick, but Beth disbelieves her.

Mark walks through the center of town on his way to work, greeting several people he knows including Maggie Radcliffe, who runs the local newspaper, Olly a reporter at the paper, Becca Fisher who owns the local hotel/pub, the local minister Paul Coates, and family friend Ellie Miller who is returning to work as a police detective. He's picked up in the company van by his coworker Nige who asks him about ""last night"". Mark demurs.

Ellie returns to work at the police station after several weeks maternity leave. She gives gifts to her coworkers but is quickly called into her bosses office where she is informed that a promotion to Deputy Inspector which Ellie had been expecting will go to someone else. Ellie is furious, stating that she only took the time off because she had been assured that the position would wait for her. She is even more angry when she learns that the position has gone to a man despite her boss's previous insistence that ""this area needs a female DI"" and that the new DI, an experienced investigator named Alec Hardy had been in charge of ""the Sandbrook murders"".

Beth goes to a school football game which Danny was supposed to attend but becomes alarmed when she can't find him and learns that no one has seen him that day. She begins calling around and learns from Jack Marshall that Danny did not show up for his paper route that morning. She asks Danny's friend Tom Miller, Ellie's son, about Danny's whereabouts but the boy indicates he doesn't know anything. While driving along a coastal road, Beth gets caught in a traffic jam. When she asks another motorist what's going on she learns that the police found a body on the beach nearby. Beth frantically runs towards the beach.

On the beach, forensic technicians are examining a body as police establish a perimeter to keep onlookers away. Alec Hardy approaches, pleading under his breath ""Oh god don't do this to me"" and sees that the boyd is that a young boy. Ellie Miller arrives but becomes distraught when she recognizes the boy as Danny Latimer, her son's best friend. Hardy admonishes her to ""shut it off"" because they're working a case. He asks if the cliff is a suicide spot and Ellie tells him no. Beth soon arrives and runs towards the body past the police barricade. The officers and Ellie try to stop her, but Beth recognizes Danny's shoes and becomes hysterical.

At the local newspaper, Olly returns from covering the local soccer game and festival. He receives an email from the Daily Mail about his job application and opens it only to find a rejection letter. Maggie sends a dejected Olly to the beach to look into the closure.

Atop the cliff over the beach Hardy and Ellie talk with the forensic technicians who state that the angle of the body and the evidence atop the cliff make it unlikely that Danny jumped or fell. The technician doubts that Danny was even atop the cliff. As they leave the beach, they are approached by Olly, who is Ellie's nephew. He asks about the body and whether there's been an ID. They tell him that they have no comment and that a formal statement will be coming.

Ellie and Hardy travel to the Latimer house where they make the formal announcement that they found Danny dead. They question the family about the previous night and Beth says that she last saw him in his bedroom about 9pm the night before. They also say that there were no signs of forced entry to the house. Mark Latimer asks to see the body, hoping that the boy was misidentified as Danny. At the morgue he identifies the dead boy as Danny and says goodbye to his son.

At an internal police briefing, Ellie informs her colleagues that Beth had Chloe when she was fifteen and Mark was seventeen. Both Beth and Chloe were watching tv the previous night and then went to bed. Mark was out on an emergency call for his plumbing job and returned around 3am but did not check on Danny. Hardy stresses the need to keep details of the case secret from the public until they are officially ready to announce them. The local police chief takes Hardy for a walk where she questions whether he is the best man for the job. She states that she doesn't ""want Sandbrook to become a liability."" Hardy derides the quality of her existing investigators and insists that Sandbrook isn't a liability but rather an asset because it makes him motivated the solve the killing.

Ellie and Hardy question Jack Marshall, a shop owner who employed Danny on a paper route. He indicates that nothing seemed wrong with the boy but that he only saw him briefly on any given day and so wouldn't necessarily know. They next visit the coroner who gives his findings that Danny was strangled, probably by a male due to the size of the hands, sometime between 10pm and 4am. There was no sign of sexual violence and the coroner says that the killer was likely looking Danny in the face as he strangled him.

Ellie and Hardy return to the Latimer House where they inform them that the police are considering Danny's death as suspicious. Beth says she should have checked on Danny but Ellie tells her not to blame herself. Hardy promises to find the killer. Beth breaks down in tears and Chloe quietly slips out. She meets with her boyfriend, and older boy. He comforts her and then asks if her parents know about them, saying that he's concerned because she is still underage. He then takes her on his dirt bike to the beach where she lays one of Danny's favorite stuffed animals down as a makeshift memorial. Olly, who is lurking nearby recognizes Chloe. He calls Ellie and asks if the body is that of Danny Latimer. Ellie repeats that she cannot make a statement but Olly realizes that his identification is correct and hangs up. Ellie calls Olly back angrily and insists that she did not give a confirmation and that he cannot publish it. Olly dithers for some time and then sends out a tweet tentatively identifying the body as Danny's.

At the Latimer house the police are taking away Danny's computer to be examined when Chloe storms in demanding to know why they have released Danny's name despite promises not to. Alec Hardy berates his colleagues for the leak and then is forced to go on local tv to confirm that Danny is the victim and that they are treating his death as suspicious. In London, reporter Karen White is working transcribing press releases when a colleague informs her about the twitter alert on Danny's death. When she sees Alec Hardy on tv she expresses amazement that he could still get a job after Sandbrook. She asks her boss to let her travel to Broadchurch to cover the crime, but he begs off as Danny ""doesn't fit the profile"" for a big story and he doesn't want to spend the money. When Hardy returns to his room at the Trader's Hotel, Becca Fisher expresses her condolences and asks if the beach will reopen soon. Hardy simply stares at her. He is then approached by Maggie and Olly. Maggie makes Olly apologize for tweeting Danny's identity and states that in the future all of the paper's reportage on the murder will go through her.

Returning home, Ellie talks with her husband who asks whether they should be worried about the kids and commiserates with her over her dislike of her new boss. When she expresses doubt about her ability to continue the investigation he reassures her. At the Latimer house, Beth asks Mark why he didn't check in on Danny when he returned but he turns the question back on her. She then asks where he was last night and he reiterates that he was on a job. Ellie talks to her son Tom, informing him about Danny's death. She tells him that the police may want to ask him questions soon and asks if Danny was upset about anything recently. Tom shakes his head no. However, when Ellie leaves, he deletes several text messages from Danny from his mobile phone. He then goes on his computer and deletes emails which he received from Danny.

Ellie shows Hardy cctv footage from the town center the night of Danny's death. It shows a boy wearing clothes like Danny's and of the same height, riding Danny's skateboard down the road. The tape seems to show that Danny snuck out and was not abducted. Hardy questions why Danny went out and who he was meeting. Ellie mentions that they should also look into what happened to Danny's skateboard and his mobile phone, neither of which were found by he body. Later, Hardy holds a formal press conference where he notes that the murder is a ""terrible anomaly"" in the low crime area and he promise that ""We will catch whoever did this."""

Olly is about to offer her an empty desk when Maggie, the paper's owner and publisher arrives and denies Karen's request. After leaving, Karen texts Olly, asking if he would show her around the town instead.

Alec Hardy is walking the cliffs near the beach. He sees a vacation cabin on the bluffs near where Danny was found and sees Susan Wright walking her dog nearby. Hardy returns to the police department where Karen White tries to talk with him but he rudely rebuffs her. He then tells Ellie to find out who owns the hut on Briar Cliff and to collect the CCTV footage from a nearby car park. He asks after staffing but Ellie tells him that more officers won't come until the weekend is over. She also tells him that Jack Marshall wants to speak with him. When Hardy interviews Marshall the shop keeper tells him about an incident about a month prior when he had seen Danny arguing with a local postman.

At the Latimer house, Ellie takes elimination fingerprints from the family and introduces them to Pete their family liaison officer who informs them that they're his first case. Beth gives Ellie a list of people who the family thinks might have done it and Ellie is shocked to see that it's a list of their friends. The officers who are searching Danny's room call Ellie over. They found 500 pounds in cash taped to the bed frame in Danny's room and a bagging of cocaine hidden in Chloe's room. She questions Chloe about the drugs. Chloe insists that she doesn't do drugs or deal them and that it's got nothing to do with Danny's murder. Under pressure from Ellie, Chloe identifies Becca Fisher as the one who gave her the drugs. Ellie presses her about the money but Chloe denies knowing anything. Ellie and Hardy question Becca Fisher about the cocaine. She says that a guest at the hotel had inquired about getting cocaine. She had asked Chloe for help but by the time Chloe returned with the drugs the couple had left. She says that Chloe had had claimed to have gotten it from an unidentified friend.

Karen meets with Olly and pumps him for information about the town. Back at the police station, Ellie catches a phone technician, Steve Connelly, who is installing extra phone lines in the station, looking at crime scene photos of Danny and gently scolds him. She and Hardy then question the postman who Marshall saw Danny arguing with. The man denies arguing with Danny saying that he barely knew the boy. He claims to have been drinking with a group of friend the night Danny was murdered.

At the Latimer house, Beth feels trapped and decides to go shopping against the advice of the police. At the store she takes note of Danny's favorite cereal but begins to notice everyone looking at her. As she goes to leave her anxiety rises as someone helps her with her bags and offers his condolences. When Reverend Coates comes up to her she confesses that she is pregnant and the two talk. Chloe meets with her boyfriend Dean and tells him that the police found the cocaine. He is worried that the police will discover that he was the source of it, stating that his uncle will kill him. As Chloe walks off, Karen White approaches and asks her for a light for her cigarette. She then gives Chloe back Danny's stuffed animal, saying that it will be stolen if left at the beach, and gives Chloe her phone number.

At the police station Ellie and Hardy meet and discuss the case. Hardy informs that the postman's alibi was confirmed by his friends. Hardy insists that no killer behaves normally over time and urges Ellie to use her local expertise to determine who is behaving oddly. Hardy later goes to Susan Wright's mobile home to request the keys for the hut on Briar Cliff, which she manages. Unseen by Hardy, Wright is in possession of Danny's skateboard. Later he and Ellie review the cctv footage from the car park nearby and see Mark Latimer waiting in the car park the night Danny was killed. They are then approached by Steve Connolly, who claims that he was psychically told that Danny's death was ""something to do with water"" and that Danny was in a boat. Hardy angrily dismisses Connolly but he and Ellie end up interviewing him. Hardy berates Connolly for trying to inject himself into the case and tells him not to come around again. As they are leaving Connolly tells Hardy ""She says she forgives you... about the pendant."" Ellie then reviews Danny's social media posts which seem to indicate a disattisfaction with his father.

Reverend Coates goes on tv talking about Danny's death. Enraged, Mark storms over to the church and assault Coates, saying ""Your god left my son for dead!"" Later, Harding questions Mark again, informing him of the CCTV footage. He asks Mark to explain what happened. Mark claims to have been out with ""a mate"" but says he can't remember the man's name or what exactly they did. Meanwhile, Ellie is at the hut on Briar Cliff where the forensic technicians. They tell her that the hut has been ""ruthlessly cleaned"" except for a bloody fingerprint near the door which matches Danny's. They also inform her of a set of prints near the sink. When she runs them against the elimination prints she discovers that they belong to Mark Latimer."

Karen White approaches Jack Marshall to try and get information but he rebuffs her.

Alec has Ellie give the morning briefing at the police station which she stumbles nervously through.

He also explains that he had been in the cottage at Briar Cliff a few weeks before to fix a broken pipe.

At the Latimer house, Pete asks Beth when Mark got home the night Danny died, which causes her to become suspicious.

At the marina, Ellie and Alec check Mark Latimer's boat and find blood stains in it. They also question Susan Wright, the woman who manages the cabin. She denies that Latimer ever got the keys to the cabin from her and denies that there was even a burst pipe. They also question Nige who confirms Mark's story. However, Ellie talks with his mother who says that Nige was in with her all night. When they confront Mark with the new evidence he maintains that he's telling the truth about the cabin and refuses to explain his whereabouts the night of Danny's death. He explains the bloodstains as being from a week or so ago when he had taken Danny and Chloe out fishing and Danny had stepped on a fish hook. Frustrated with Mark's intransigence, Alec arrests him for obstructing an investigation.

Becca Fisher comes into the police station and tells Ellie that Mark was with her the night of Danny's death and that they had been having an affair. When confronted with her confession, Mark admits to the infidelity, saying that it was a mistake and the only time it has happened despite multiple opportunities he's been given.

Alec returns to the hotel where he's staying and sees Karen White. She angrily derides him for his failures in the Sandbrook case saying that ""that family lacks closure"" because of Alec's failure. She tells him that she's not going to let him do the same thing in Broadchurch.

As they lie in bed unable to sleep, Beth questions Mark about where he was the night Danny died. When he puts off telling her she asks him if she murdered Danny.

Karen gets a call from her editor who berates her for going after the story despite his telling her no. She makes the case for covering Broadchurch and he tells her that he might print the story if she can get an interview with the family.

Alec and Ellie meet with the Latimer family to update them on the investigation. Mark expresses frustration that the story has seemed to have dropped out of the media and he wonders if anyone cares.

The police hold a public meeting for the community to update them on the case. At the meeting Maggie notices Susan Wright asking a question and inquires with Olly about her name.

Beth arranges a meeting at her house between Steve and the detectives. When Steve tries to tell them that Danny was killed by someone he knew Alec tells him that it's offensive. Ellie tells Beth that Steve has had previous convictions for fraud. Alec drags Steve out of the house and warns him not to come around any more. Beth asks why Steve would lie and Ellie explains that he is looking to cash in on the notoriety that helping to solve the murders will give him. Beth, realizing that Steve tricked her, says ""My god, I'm so alone.""

Maggie confronts Susan and tells her about the picture with the other name. Susan says that the paper must have just gotten it wrong.

Ellie asks about him watching her and Beth the other night and he explains that he has had insomnia for several years and often spends the time wandering. But he claims to not remember wandering the night Danny died. He also mentions that Danny and Tom were great with computers. Ellie points out to Alec that from the church you can see the field behind the Latimer house.

Karen meets with the Latimer family and tells them that Danny should be getting more coverage but explains that the story isn't getting attention because Danny was the wrong age and sex. She says that for them to get more attention Beth will have to give an interview to personalize the story. Beth hesitantly agrees.

During dinner he asks questions of Joe but seems to answer few himself. Joe does get him to admit that he is divorced with a fifteen year old daughter who lives with her mother. Joe asks Alec if they will solve Danny's murder and Alec says he's certain of it. When Ellie goes to the bathroom, Alec asks Joe if Ellie likes working with him. Joe claims that Ellie hasn't said anything about not liking him, but Alec sees through him. The two bond over the moment.

Maggie is working late in the Echo's offices when she hears a noise. She goes to check and realizes it's just some people on the street. When she returns to her office she is confronted by Susan Wright. Susan warns Maggie to stay out of her life threatening to have her raped if she keeps digging.

As Alec returns to his hotel he sees Susan leaving the Echo's offices but doesn't think anything amiss. His vision suddenly goes blurry and he races into his room. In the bathroom he tries to take some pills but instead collapses on the floor, blood seeping from his head.

Alec wakes up in the hospital. Becca Fisher is there. She says she found him on the floor of his hotel room and called an ambulance, telling them that she was his wife so they'd let her come along.

Following him are the Latimers and a procession of people. Ellie and Hardy hope that the ""recreation"" of Danny's last hours will influence people to come forward with information. Along the way, Mark sees Becca Fisher. The two look away when Beth notices them. Observing the procession from his store, Jack Marshall prays.

Afterwards, Beth watches a news story about the procession. Mark comes in and say they need to talk about what happened. She tells him that she's had ""offers"" too and could have ""shagged all your mates"" but that she didn't because she's ""a human being"" and not ""an animal."" She talks about how she sometimes feels she's stuck on a wheel repeating the same things over and over again. She's been with him since she was fifteen and he's the only man she's slept with. She demands to know why Mark cheated and what's so special about Becca Fisher. He tells her that Becca wasn't prettier or sexier, but just new. He talks about how he knows he's been doing the same things every second and will be doing the same things forever and Becca was a chance for something new. Beth tells him she's pregnant and he tells her she has to keep it. Unknown to the two of them, Chloe can hear their argument from her room.

At the Echo, Olly gives Karen a file with all of the paper's stories on Jack Marshall since he moved to town. She lets him write the article about the recreation, saying that they'll publish it under her byline.

At the police station, Ellie and Hardy review their evidence. Ellie gives Hardy a list of the boats reported missing in the last several months, noting that the burned boat was not among them. They took a look at the murder that the Yorkshire police had tipped them off about but it was a ten year old girl who was raped and stabbed to death and so doesn't fit the MO of Danny's killing. They discuss how the only prints and DNA found on Danny's phone were those expected to be there, including Mark, Danny's father, and Jack Marshall, who found the phone. Hardy notes that Marshall may have claimed to have found the phone because he knew his DNA would be on it. Ellie notes that Mark confirmed that the phone was Danny's but that she had always seen Danny with a smart phone like her son's. She notes that the phone they have is set to forward to another number, presumably the smartphone but that the other phone is turned off and there's no way to track it. Hardy wonders how Danny could have afforded two cell phones. Ellie notes that he had the big wad of money in his room. Hardy wonders if the money came from Jack Marshall.

When Ellie returns home, she finds her sister waiting for her. The sister asks her for a loan of a thousand pounds to help her out. Ellie angrily turns her down, noting that she's already lent her three thousand and that her sister should seek professional help. She accuses her of being self obsessed. Lucy says that she saw something the night Danny died. Ellie disbelieves her, accusing her of using a boy's death for her own ends. She asks what Lucy saw and Lucy demands a thousand pounds. Ellie angrily leaves saying that ""I don't even know you.""

At the Echo, Karen edits Danny's story, showing him how to polish it up. She sends it to her paper and Danny excitedly kisses her. She pushes him away and he apologizes saying he's wanted to do that since she first arrived. She says that they're working together and calls him a ""cheeky bastard"" but then kisses him back.

The next day the Daily Herald arrives with a cover story about Jack Marshall and a headline ""I Didn't Kill Your Son"". As they drive to work, Nige tries to persuade Mark Latimer to ""sort out"" the situation themselves. Mark says they should wait for evidence, but Nige persists, arguing that waiting may lead to another child's death. Mark angrily shouts at him saying that he can't do anything but that if Nige wants to that's fine.

Karen and Olly wake up in bed together. Olly notices that he's late for work and frantically rushes to get ready. Karen tells him to leave out the back in order to avoid ""small town gossip"". Olly asks her if the sex was good and if they could do it again. She notes that Olly is very needy but tells him that the sex was good, and that maybe they'll do it again. She then asks him how one would get the burned boat out at that far. Olly says that maybe the two of them should try and find out themselves. When he goes to leave he find the Herald with the story about Jack Marshall and shows it to Karen.

Chloe Latimer calls her friends and tells them to boycott Jack Marshall's store. Her grandmother, Liz sticks up for Jack saying that she knows him and he ""wouldn't hurt a fly."" Chloe notes that Jack was in prison and that he saw Danny every day. She says that the police have been useless so far.

At the police station Ellie and Hardy meet with their boss and discuss possible suspects. They note that Jack Marshall has no alibi for the night of Danny's death and had the boy's cell phone in his possession. Hardy also says that Mark Latimer is still a suspect since he lied to them about his whereabouts and that there's still two hours missing from his alibi. He also mentions that Mark hit Danny according to Tom Miller's statement. When asked whether Mark could have done it, Ellie answers that she doesn't know. Hardy also says that Paul Coates should be a suspect since he has no alibi and his church has a view of the Latimer house. He's running a background check on him but their supervisor tells him to be careful and not risk offending the church.

Paul Coates meets with Becca Fisher and reviews her financial documents. He notes that she's had less income than she had projected and that the bank is demanding repayment of a loan. Beth storms in and begins tearing apart Becca's pub room, smashing glasses, turning on the beer taps, throwing crisps around. She berates Becca for sleeping with her husband and warns her to stay away from her family. Paul ushers her out.

Karen calls her boss, angry that he edited her article in order to make Jack Marshall look more guilty than she had intended. He tells her that he simply punched up the article enough for her to land on the front page and that she should dig more into Jack Marshall's background.

Jack meets with Hardy, who advises him to cooperate with their investigation so that they can clear his name. Jack scoffs that he's heard that before and it ended up with him being charged with a crime. Hardy asserts that the only thing they care about is Danny's death.

Chloe meets with her boyfriend. He tells her that Jack Marshall had kicked him out of the Sea Brigade because Marshall had always liked to hug the boys and he had refused. Chloe texts a Karen and the two kiss. Unseen by them, Mark observes them from afar.

Chloe and Dean go to the Echo and meet with Karen and Olly. Dean gives them a list of other boys who were in Sea Brigade when he was. She advises them to go to the police with this information as well.

Beth and Paul talk. She apologizes for wrecking Becca's pub in front of him but says it felt good. Paul suggests that she see a bereavement counselor, but she refuses, saying that her anger is all she has right now. She tells Paul that Mark thinks she should keep the baby and Paul agrees. She says she hates it and refers to the pregnancy as ""a thing which is growing inside me."" She says that Danny should be growing and she wasn't done with him yet. She says she failed as a mother since she didn't keep Danny safe and asks why God would create Danny and then take him back. Paul suggests that some think God takes those he loves most sooner and Beth calls God selfish. Beth asks why she's being punished.

Tom Miller plays games at an arcade. When he runs out of money he goes to leave and stops to pet Susan Wright's dog. Susan invites Tom to come by her place any time and walk the dog.

Jack Marshall sits in his shop as photographers crowd outside taking pictures. He calls in Hardy and Ellie and demands police protection but Ellie says that since he hasn't been threatened they can't provide any. Hardy presses Jack Marshall about the details he's kept back. Jack says that he had been a music teacher and that he had ""a relationship"" with a female student. He claims that the attraction was mutual but her father reported them and he served a year in prison. He says that the girl was 15 years and 11 months old and that if she were a month older he would have escaped any legal consequences. When Ellie asks whether he had any contact with the girl since he says that he married her after his release from prison when she was 17 and he was 40.

Paul Coates approaches Ellie and Hardy and asks for them to help Jack Marshall insisting that he's an ""innocent and scared man"" who is being wrongfully hounded. Hardy tells him that his concern is noted and walks off. Hardy insists to Ellie that Marshall should still be a suspect and that they cannot be distracted by the press. They meet with their head of forensics. He tells them that they found four cigarette butts near Danny's body and that since they weren't washed away by the tide they had to have been left there around the time the body was deposited on the beach. He says that the cigarettes were from a rare high tar brand that someone might remember having sold recently. Hardy says that it doesn't make sense that the killer would drop off a body and then stand and smoke four cigarettes.

Nige comes by Susan Wright's trailer and gives her a package with 500 pounds in it. She says ""that's all I'm worth"" and Nige threatens to get his crossbow. She tells him they need to find a way to ""work this out... together.""

Mark confronts Chloe about her boyfriend and asks how old he is. She says he's seventeen, which makes them the same age as Mark and Beth when they were together. Mark asks if they're having sex and she says yes. She also says that they're using condoms which is more than Mark and Beth did. She yells at him for flirting with Becca Fisher right in front of her when she was working at the hotel. Their argument is interrupted by the doorbell. It's Tom Miller who tells Mark that the other dads are forming a posse to get Jack Marshall.

A bunch of angry men arrive at the Sea Brigade hall. Mark shows up and tells them to back off. He goes and talks to Jack who explains that he had an affair with a teenage girl and that they later married and had a son. Mark asks where his son is now. Jack says that his son was killed at age six in a car accident while he wife was driving. The grief over their loss tore them apart. He says that his interest in the boys and his giving them hugs wasn't sexual, but motivated by his missing his son. He says that he would never harm Danny and that he and Mark are ""the same"" noting that no parent should outlive their child. Mark angrily tells the mob of men to go home and then advises Jack that it's not safe and he should leave.

Olly takes Karen down to the beach where his boat is kept. He explains that his father used to take him out on it all the time when he was a kid but after his dad left he hasn't taken it out. The boat is kept tied up on the beach with some others. When they get there, however, the boat is gone.

At night Jack Marshall awakes to noise outside his house. When he goes out he discovers that someone has smashed his car window and spray painted ""paedo"" on one of his boats.

Olly goes to Ellie with the information about the boat. He says the last time he saw it was eight weeks ago. He also asks that if it is the boat which burned then she give him the story. She ignores him and walks out. Brian, the forensics technician confirms to her that the wreckage of the burned boat matches Olly's. Then Brian asks her out for a drink. She tells him she's married. She explains to Hardy that the boat had belonged to her brother-in-law who left her sister several years ago. Hardy asks who knew that the boat was there and she says everybody did. Hardy wonders if Danny knew about the boat. She asks Hardy if they're going to catch the killers and notes that he didn't do so in Sandbrook. He tells her that Sandbrook is different but she presses him on what went wrong. He says that a mistake was made, a big mistake. When she asks him whether it was made by him he says he doesn't want to talk about it and promises that they won't let the town down.

As they ready to go to bed Mark tells Beth that he loves her. She says that he's said that a lot since he got caught, and asks if Danny knew about him and Becca. Mark says no. Mark asks Beth that just for that night they have no bickering and no silences and find something else to talk about.

Becca Fisher comes to Alec's rooms and tells him that she has a lot of reporters asking for rooms. She knows he doesn't want to bump into them in the hallways but she needs the business. She offers him a half off rate for allowing the journalists to stay there. Hardy commiserates with her about how hard it is running the hotel and then asks if she'd like to spend the night. She turns him down saying that she'd be worried he might collapse.

Beth and Mark go through Danny's things and reminisce about their son. At the same time, Jack Marshall gets a delivery of newspapers, all of which carry headlines about him and his past, one reading ""Child Bride of Broadchurch Jack"". It carries a photo of Jack with his wife and son and when he sees it he breaks down weeping. The next morning, Hardy and Ellie are called to the beach where they find Jack's dead body."

He sees Steven Connelly, Paul Coates, Nigel, and Mark Latimer standing near the surf watching him. He yells at them to get away from the water. They ignore his cries. He wakes up yelling and takes some pills.

In the police station Hardy looks at a paper whose headline describes him as ""The Worst Cop in Britain."" He tells Ellie that their Supervisor will be scaling back the manpower on the Latimer case soon. They prepare to go to Jack Marshall's funeral. Hardy tells Ellie that the killer might be there and that they should watch for anything unusual. He tells her that he tailed Paul Coates the other night and found him going to an AA meeting. He asks her to look into him.

The Latimer's prepare for the funeral. Mark tells Beth that he's thinking of going back to work soon and asks her when they're going to talk about the baby. She puts him off.

At the newspaper Olly gets ready for the funeral when Karen arrives. He tells her he felt insulted that she didn't call or try to contact him but just left town. She says that she felt guilty after Jack committed suicide and went to stay with a friend before returning to work. Maggie shows up and berates Kate for contributing to Jack's death but Kate blames the town for turning on him so quickly.

At the funeral, Paul Coates delivers an angry eulogy noting that the town failed Jack and also failed Danny. Afterwards, the community heads to the Trader's for a wake. Ellie and Hardy keep watch to see who is acting strangely. Ellie notes Nigely laughing with some men. Maggie asks Ellie about whether she found anything on Susan Wright and Ellie says she's too busy to really look into it. Alec almost collapses in the middle of the wake, an action that others put off as too much drinking. He steadies himself and goes to question Tom about Paul Coates. Joe intervenes before he can question him too much though. Later, Tom is sitting, playing a video game when Chloe tries to slip out with Dean. She asks him to tell anyone who asks that she's in the loo. When she refers to the fact that he was Danny's best friend, Tom angrily denies it. He says he hated Danny.

Beth meets with Karen who explains that she's not writing about the case anymore and that there likely won't be any more news coverage until the killer is caught. Beth asks Karen if she can introduce her to some of the families from the Sandrbook killings so that she can talk with someone about what she's going through. Karen agrees to try.

Hardy and Ellie question Olly who tells them that anyone could have taken his boat. He says that the last time he used it was about six months before when he took Danny and Tommy paintballing. Ellie expresses surprise and Olly says that Tom asked Joe if he could go because he knew she would say no. He says that lots of people paid his mom to rent the boat, including Paul Coats.

Ellie and Hardy question Paul, who says that he took the boat out for a fishing trip about a year ago. Hardy questions him about his alcoholism and Coates angrily insists that has nothing to do with the case. Hardy insists that he should come in and give a DNA sample.

Mark goes back to work and finds it hard to deal with the solicitousness of Nigel and his clients. Chloe returns to school but finds that everyone is staring at her and has a hard time concentrating in class. Beth goes running and then meets with one of the mothers from Sandbrook. The woman tells her not to trust Hardy, that he messed up the Sandbrook murders: lost evidence, ""bollocksed up"" the trial and let the murderer go free. The conversation does little to comfort Beth as the woman tells her that her own marriage fell apart as many do after the murder of a child and that she fills up her day with crying, drinking, and sleeping pills. Afterwards, Beth gets a call that Chloe left school. Mark picks her up and drives her to the farm outside town where Dean lives. There they find Chloe listening to music with Dean and dancing. She says that she couldn't take everyone staring at her and that she feels suffocated by being ""the dead boy's sister."" Dean built her a ""happy room"" where she can go to just enjoy herself and forget about losing Danny.

Paul is in the police station giving a DNA sample to Hardy. He asks why Hardy seems to have something against him and Hardy accuses Paul of trying to insert himself into this crisis in order to aggrandize the Church. Paul says that people came to him looking for hope because Hardy and the police were not able to provide it. Later, Hardy leaves a phone message for his daughter, telling her that he thinks about her all the time and wondering if they might speak soon.

Maggie calls a friend of hers at another paper to dig deeper into Susan Wright, figuring that they will have to do so themselves since the police won't do anything. He soon faxes her a file full of information. Maggie goes and leaves the file on the door of Susan Wright's trailer.

Tom asks Paul Coates if there's any way to retrieve information which has been deleted from a computer. Paul tells him that it can be done by a technician or with retrieval programs. Later, Tom is standing on the beach when he's approached by Susan Wright and her dog. He plays with the dog as Susan talks to him. She warns him that it's dangerous for him to be alone near the spot where they found the dead boy. Tom tells her that he and Danny used to be friends. She invites Tom back to her trailer to feed her dog. While there she shows him Danny's skateboard and tells him that he can have it since he was Danny's friend.

Mark takes his family to the arcade, insisting that they should play some games and have fun. They play air hockey and grabbers and enjoy themselves. Later, they have some food and reminisce about happier times. Chloe says that they should take the baby to the arcade when it's born.

Tom takes the skateboard home and shows it to his parents. Ellie tells him to put it down and not touch and asks him where he got it. The police arrive in force at Susan Wright's trailer, She's not there so they bust in. Susan is instead at the offices of the Echo where Maggie shows her copies of headlines proclaiming ""murder"". She says that she knows all about her husband and children and the crimes which she was accused, but never proven, to have committed. She says that Susan threatened her and so she wants Susan to know that it was her who turned Susan in to the cops. Ellie and Hardy stand behind Susan to arrest her. Outside the Echo, Nigel finds Susan's dog tied to a post and takes him away. The only emotion Susan shows is when she's being lead away and sees that her dog is missing.

At the police station, Hardy and Ellie interrogate Susan, but she doesn't tell them anything. She says she won't talk until she sees her dog. Hardy leaves her to sit in a cell and think and tells Ellie to find the dog.

That night, Nigel drives Susan's dog to a secluded spot and aims his crossbow at it. The same night, Paul Coates finds Tom outside smashing a computer with a rock.

At the police station, Ellie gets a call that someone saw a torch being used inside the hut where Danny was killed. She and Hardy race over there. A figure bursts through the cabin door and they give chase. They follow the figure into a boatyard, unable to see who it is. As they search through the drydocked boats, Ellie's mobile rings and the person rushes by, knocking her down. They chase after him but Hardy collapses in pain. Ellie tends to him as the figure runs off. The other police arrive just then and Ellie tells them to go after the fugitive and call and ambulance."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2738132/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,Hardy knows his time is running out to solve Danny's murder - will the discovery of a vital clue finally unlock the case?,[],TV-14,Release date,['James Strong'],[''],[],"['estranged mother', 'crossbow', 'cardiac arrhythmia', 'dog']",[],"Alec has flashbacks to a young boy on a beach and a young girl. He awakes in a hospital bed after having a heart arrhythmia during the chase. Ellie is there. She tells him that the doctors told her about his condition and how he'd had a previous attack and check himself out against medical advice. He tells her he's been six for about a year and a half and it has gotten worse in the last couple of months. She asks why he took the job knowing he was too sick. He tells her that they're close to finding the killer and asks her to not tell their supervisor. Ellie walks out.

Ellie briefs their team, telling them to go through everyone without an alibi or with a weak alibi and to find her dog, Vince. Against medical advice, Hardy checks himself out of hospital and heads back to work. His supervisor informs him that she will be sending him to see the medical officer tomorrow and that he will most likely be relieved of duty. She also asks why he took the job if he knew he was that ill/

Ellie questions Susan Wright. She says that in addition to the skateboard, they found cigarettes matching Susan's brand in the sand around Danny's body. At first, Susan denies knowing anything. Ellie threatens to charge her and have her dog put to sleep when found. Reluctantly, Susan says that she was out walking her dog the night of Danny's murder when she saw the body from the cliff top. She made her way down to the beach and looked at Danny's body. Ellie finds it odd that Susan would stand over a dead boy's body and smoke cigarettes and then not tell anyone. Susan says that Danny was ""beautiful"" and that she knew his body would be found but that she didn't want to get involved.

Ellie pressures Susan to talk about her previous run in with the law. Susan says that they had two daughters. Her husband was molesting the older daughter. When he tried to do the same to the younger daughter the older one intervened and he killed her. She claims she didn't know about the abuse until afterwards. When her husband was arrested he accused her of knowing. At the time, Susan was pregnant and social services took the baby from her, finding her to be an unfit mother.

At the Echo, Maggie hears from a source about Hardy's medical problems. She gives Olly the chance to ask Hardy about it. Meanwhile, Hardy meets with Steve Connolly, desperate for any lead. Connolly tells him that Danny knew the killer and that it was someone ""close to home."" Connolly reminds Hardy that he told him ""She forgives you about the pendant"" and he can tell that this means something to him. He also tells him that he saw that Hardy had been here before. Afterwards, Olly meets with Hardy to offer him the chance to explain his situation to them.

Beth and Mark meet with Paul Coates for some counseling. She says that they're due for a scan with the new baby but she's not sure if she wants to go through with it. She says that her heart is still full of grief for Danny and that she wishes she had been taken instead. Mark remembers the beautiful, happy girl Beth was when they first met and how Danny's murder has changed this. He says that he wonders if Beth wouldn't have been better off not meeting him. Reverend Coates advises Beth to go get the ultrasound and then make her decision. The Latimer's go to the doctor's and seem happy afterwards.

Ellie continues to interrogate Susan, saying that there's no way she could have seen Danny's body from the cliff tops. Under pressure, Susan admits to having been walking on the beach. She says she saw a boat, a small one with an outboard motor. A man pulled up to the beach and laid Danny's body there before leaving. She also says she recognized the man.

The police bring Nigel in for questioning in Danny's murder. They find Susan Wright's dog chained up in his garden and a gun closet with rifles and his crossbow. Nigel calls Mark and tells him about his arrest and that it's all wrong. Mark advises him to just tell the truth.

Hardy interrogates Nigel. At first he claims not to know Susan Wright, but when Hardy tells him that they found her dog in his garden he admits to knowing her. At the same time, Ellie is interrogating Susan. Susan says that Nigel came to her trailer and threatened her with his crossbow because he ""didn't like what I was saying"" but she claims to forget what she said to have angered Nigel. Hardy pressures Nigel about Danny's murder. He says he wasn't involved in it. Hardy pressures him as to why she would accuse Nigel of dumping the body and Nigel says that it's because she's his mother.

Susan says that Nigel is the son who was taken from her 25 years ago. Recently the law had changed and she was able to try and make contact but that when she did he wanted nothing to do with her. Susan says that she told the police that Nigel did it because he's his father's son and she can't ""let it happen again.""

Pressed for an alibi, Nigel says that the night of the murder he had driven out to a local estate where he was poaching pheasants. He had run out of petrol and siphoned some from a tractor and then cut a hole in the fence to make it look like a break in. Hardy gives Nigel a file containing newspaper clippings about Susan's family and her husband's arrest. Nigel reads them and weeps.

Ellie yells at Hardy for giving Nigel the file when she had promised Susan that they wouldn't tell him. He tells her that the phone which gave them the tip about the break in at the cabin was made from Danny's missing mobile phone. They wonder why the killer would call in a tip and then try to escape. He tells Ellie that he's going to have Susan and Nigel released and kept under surveillance in the hope that something will happen. Just then he gets a phone call and leaves.

Hardy meets with Paul Coates who gives him Tom Miller's smashed laptop. Coates says he was out walking his regular route when he found the boy trying to destroy it. When Hardy asks why Tom would be trying to destroy his best mate's computer Coates asks if they were best friends. He says that a couple of months ago he had to break up a serious fight between the two boys. He says he had informed both sets of parents and had thought that Ellie would have told him. He also says that Tom threatened to accuse him of abusing Danny if he gave the computer to the police, but denies having done anything inappropriate. When Hardy asks about what he said to Tom at the wake, Coates says he was just trying to comfort the boy. Alec takes the computer and calls a friend to try and get any information off of it.

Hardy meets with Olly and Maggie. He tells them that he was injured pursuing a suspect and asks them not to publish this for a few days. Maggie agrees but asks him to tell them about Sandbrook. He tells them that the case against their suspect had been circumstantial until they found a pendant which belonged to one of the victims in a car the suspect owned. One of his Detective Sergeants was taking the evidence back to the police station when she stopped at a hotel for a drink. While inside her car was broken into and her belongings, including the evidence, was stolen. He says that she was having an affair with another DS and had stopped to celebrate. When Maggie points out that the Herald had reported that it was his car which was broken into he says that he took the heat for her because she was his wife and he didn't want their daughter knowing about the affair. He tells them that if they publish they should tells the family in the Sandbrook case first and let them know that the case isn't closed.

Susan Wright returns home and finds Nigel sitting in her trailer. He tells her that if she doesn't leave within the hour he will kill her dog. She says that if she leaves she will disappear forever and they will never see each other again. He tells her to recant her statement to the police and then leave town. She tells him that he has his father in him and that he was the one she saw.

Dean eats dinner with Chloe and her parents. He gives Beth a gift as thanks for letting him into their family. It's a doll for the new baby. The gift doesn't go over well with Beth and mark confesses that it's ""all a bit muddled."" To change the topic, Chloe asks about Nigel and Mark says he's had no news. She says it can't be Nigel. Dean agrees, saying that Nige and Danny really got on well and that he saw it every time they went out. The family is puzzled by this and Dean explains that Nigel would come by the farm with Danny and that they three of them would go hunting in the evenings. He says that Danny had assured him it was okay and that Nigel said that they had known. Mark says that they didn't.

Hardy tells Miller that the boot prints found at the hut were a man's size ten. Ellie checks and sees that Nigel's shoe size is a ten. They wonder if Susan Wright had told them the truth about Nigel. Hardy says that they're missing something and suggests that someone else may have been involved. Before sending Ellie home, Hardy asks her about how Tom and Danny were getting along. Ellie denies having heard about the fight which Paul Coates mentioned. Hardy asks if she can give him a look at her son's laptop and she agrees, annoyed.

Susan Wright, surveys her trailer and then begins to leave town. Meanwhile, Ellie searches in vain for her son's computer before going to bed. Still at the police station, Hardy receives an email from his friend with the subject line ""Tom Miller email transcripts"". After perusing the transcripts Hardy says ""Of course!""

Hardy interrogates Nigel. At first Nigel denies knowing Susan Wright."

He remembers sitting on the same beach as a child with a girl. He goes to his department mandated medical exam and is informed by his supervisor that he will have to clear out his office by the end of the day. He says he thinks he knows who the killer is, but walks away.

Joe Miller searches Tom's room for his laptop. Tom comes in and objects and Joe asks about the laptop. Tom says he lost it about a week back. Joe tells him not to lie.

Ellie meets with her sister and gives her the money she asked for. Her sister tells her that the night of Danny's murder she saw a man in dark clothing disposing of a bag of clothes in a garbage bin. At the police station, Ellie tells Hardy about the new information and that Tom claims that he lost his laptop. She says she doesn't believe her son and Hardy says he called Tom and Joe in to be interviewed. When Ellie tells him that the police have lost both Susan Wright and Nigel he angrily tells her to find them.

Nigel lays in his van calls his mother. He leaves a message telling her not to believe the things she's going to hear about him. Before he can do anything he hears police sirens.

Tom is being interviewed by Hardy, with Joe present. Tom says he left his laptop in a bag at school and it got stolen. Hardy tells him not to lie and produces the damaged laptop which Paul Coates gave him. He also produces a transcript of the emails which were gotten from the email server. Hardy says that Danny was using a different email address than the one on his computer. He used this account only to talk to Tom and one other person. Tom says that he thinks Danny sent the emails from his smartphone and that Danny had claimed to have gotten the phone by saving up money from his paper route. Hardy asks why Danny's emails ask Tom to stay away and that they're not friends. Tom says that Danny had found a new friend, one who understood him better. When Hardy brings up a series of emails in which Tom uses threatening language towards Danny, Joe ends the interview. As they leave, Hardy asks their shoe sizes. Tom says five and Joe says ten.

Mark speaks with Beth about whether they should clean out Danny's room for the new baby.

Hardy meets with Ellie down on the beach. He says that he had been here before: as a child his family had come there on holiday. He used to sit below the cliffs to escape his parent's bickering. He hadn't remembered that until he had been assigned to Broadchurch. Ellie gets a phone call that Danny's cell phone has been turned on again and that they can track it. Hardy orders her back to the station to interview Nigel. He quickly grabs her phone from her and orders that the coordinates he sent to his phone. As they leave, he praises her on the good work she's done on the case.

Using his mobile phone, Hardy tracks the cell phone signal to the neighborhood by the Latimer house. Mark Latimer and Paul Coates both see him as he walks across the lawn. He enters a house and sees Tom sitting watching cartoons. Following the signal out back he enters a work shed and finds Joe Miller with the phone. Joe says that he can't stand hiding anymore.

A flashback shows the events the night of Danny's murder. Danny had skateboarded to the cliff top hut. Inside he and Jo sat hugging each other. The hug ends and Danny goes to leave, telling Joe that he won't do this anymore and that he's going to tell his parents. Joe frantically warns Danny that no one will understand and that this will ruin their lives. Danny runs from the hut. He cuts his hand on a piece of fencing and runs towards the cliff. Joe warns him to be careful and asks the boy to come back to the hut. When they get back inside, he locks the door. Danny asks why he did that, and Joe says that he'll let Danny leave if the boy promises not to tell anyone. Danny says he knows what Joe wants from him but that Joe is too afraid to ask. He also asks why Joe never did these things with Tom. When he tries to push past Joe, Joe becomes enraged and pushes Danny up against the wall, saying ""I'm not that man."" Holding Danny by the neck, he says that he never touched either boy and never would. He says that Danny can't say those kinds of things and that Joe helped him.

When Joe realizes that Danny is dead, he panics. He runs to his car and puts plastic booties on his shoes. He carries Danny's body from the hut and puts it in the boat. Then he cleans off Danny's hands and feet. He dumps the body, and Danny's skateboard on the beach, running off just as Susan Wright comes down the beach. Returning to the hut he is briefly startled when he hears a car approaching. Looking through a window, he sees Mark Latimer and Becca Fisher returning from their tryst. When the two leave, Joe frantically begins cleaning the hut. He dumps something in a trash bin where he is seen by Ellie's sister. Returning home, he frantically scrubs his own body. Then he stands over Tom's bed and silently weeps, before going to sleep beside Ellie.

In the interrogation room, Joe tells Hardy that he was in love with Danny. About nine months ago, Danny had come by their house after Mark had hit him. Joe helped clean Danny up and comfort him. After that, Danny would talk with Joe when he'd come around to play with Tom. Danny said he couldn't talk to his own father like that and the two began meeting in secret. He says that he wanted something which was his own and would lie to Ellie about where he was. He claims he never touched Danny and that all they'd do would be hug each other, fully clothed. Hardy asks for more details, trying to understand. Joe says that if he can't understand why should Hardy. When asked, Joe admits to giving Danny the mobile phone and five hundred pounds. He said he did it because he needed Danny to love him. Hardy asks why Joe called from the cabin. Joe says that he couldn't take it any more and needed to confess. He felt responsible for Jack Marshall's death too. He had hoped that only Hardy would come, in order to spare Ellie. But when he saw his wife, he panicked and ran.

Hardy goes into the other interview room, where Ellie is interrogating Nigel. He abruptly stops the interrogation and orders everyone else out of the room. He tells Ellie that the killer is not Nigel and asks her where she was the night of Danny's death. She asks if she's a suspect and he says he'll explain but that he needs her to just answer his questions. She says that they had just gotten back from a vacation in Florida and that she had taken a sleeping pill in order to overcome her jet lag. When asked, she says that she doesn't remember Joe coming to bed. Hardy crosses to her side of the table and tells her that Joe killed Danny Latimer. Ellie insists that Joe didn't do it. She begins to cry and runs into a corner to dry heave. She says that both Susan Wright and her sister saw Nigel. Hardy explains that they mistook Joe, who has a similar build to Nigel and is also bald, for Nigel. She insists that Hardy is wrong but he tells her he's not. She then asks to see Joe.

Hardy warns her not to touch Joe or do anything which might jeopardize a conviction. She enters the interview room and Joe tries to go to her. She tells him to sit down and asks if it's true. Joe insists that he never touched their sons or Danny and says that he always loved her. She screams at him that Danny was eleven and when Joe asks about Tom, she attacks him. The other officers pull her off.

Afterwards, Hardy tells Ellie that they've booked her family a room at a nearby hotel and that she shouldn't answer the phone for anyone who isn't him. She goes by the house to pick up her things and the forensics team are already there. SOCO tech Brian Young tells her he'll have to accompany her around the house. As she leaves she notes that her family was happy here.

Hardy calls Karen Young, who upbraids him for giving Olly the story about Sandbrook. He tells her that they've caught Danny's killer and that he's giving her exclusive advanced warning of the announcement. Hardy then talks to the other officers and says that there is no evidence that Ellie knew about Joe's crime or did anything improper. He says that she'll need all their help.

He then goes to the Latimer house where he gathers the family and tells them that they've charged Danny's killer. When he tells them that it's Joe, they're disbelieving and ask if he's sure. He tells them about the meetings Danny and Joe had and that Ellie didn't know. Mark rushes out of the house. At the hotel, Ellie tells Tom that Joe was the one who killed Danny and that she can't explain it.

As Hardy makes the announcement of the arrest, Olly's mom shows up at the Echo and asks him to come with her. A montage shows the Latimer family reacting to the news. Mark rages at a beach. Chloe goes to the crime scene at the Miller house. Beth stands stunned in their house.

Mark goes to the police station, where one of the officers lets him have five minutes to speak to Joe in his cell. He asks how Joe could have done it, having been their friend. Joe apologizes and says it was an accident. He says that Danny only came to him because Mark wasn't a fit father and abused Danny. Mark screams at Joe not to use that as an excuse. He says it was only one time and now he'll be haunted by it for the rest of his life. Mark also says that Joe must have ""done stuff"" to Danny, despite his denials. Joe says that all he ever did was care for Danny. Mark says that he can't even bring himself to hate Joe. Instead he pities him, because Joe is ""nothing.""

Olly and his mom arrive at the hotel to watch the kids and give Ellie a break. She says she's going for a walk. Outside the hotel she meets Karen White, who offers her condolences and advises her not to talk to anyone. Ellie ends up on the lawn behind her house and the Latimer house. Beth Latimer comes out and asks her ""how could you not know?"" Ellie then goes to Hardy's hotel room to talk. She asks how a grown man could be in love with an eleven year old boy and wonders if he's a paedophile. She notes that there were no signs of abuse on Danny and that Tom says that Joe never did anything improper with him. Hardy says that he doesn't have the answers and insists that people are unknowable and that ""you can never really know what's in someone's heart."" He tells her that he began to suspect Joe two days ago when he got the email transcripts of Danny's account which only communicted with two people: Tom and Joe. He also tells Ellie that he really hoped he would be wrong.

The Latimers have Danny's funeral at long last. At the service, Paul Coates speaks of the bible telling them to put away all malice, be kind to each other, and forgive each other as Christ forgave. He admits that after what they've been through, doing so may be difficult but that they have a responsibility to themselves and to God to try.

Ellie and Hardy sit near the beach and discuss their futures. Ellie says that she'll be leaving town to give the kids a fresh start. Hardy says that it's all over for him since he'll be receiving a medical discharge. Ellie dubs them the ""ex detectives club.""

The Latimer's go to a bonfire on the cliff while the townspeople go to one on the beach. They light the two simultaneously and as they watch other bonfires are lit along the coast. Paul Coates says he spread the word. As they watch the fire, Beth has a vision of Danny standing nearby. The Latimer family and Dean stand together and watch the lights along the coast."

The police find 28 sticks of dynamite in his apartment. Only Sergeant Friday has the power to stop this 1950s terrorist attack.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jack Webb'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Synopsis - The Human Bomb Airing 12-16-51 Sergeants Friday and Romero are working the early watch out of Central Division, Detective Bureau, Friday gets an emergency call to return to HQ, a threat to destroy the building by a distraught individual has put the entire city block in peril. Friday narrates they have less than a half-hour to stop this man from blowing up the building; this is the story of those twenty-six minutes.

Early watch out of Central Homicide is what Sergeants Friday and Romero had been working, the boss is Thad Brown, Chief of Detectives. Friday enters the building, it is city hall, police station-jail included. The elevator operator calls out his name, flags him down, telling him they have to take this car, it is the only one in service. He brings him to the floor where his partner, Sgt. Romero, and Chief Brown meet him.

Brown tells the Sergeants, fifty-five minutes ago, a man walked in here with a home-made bomb under his arm, threatening to set it off unless his brother was released from jail by nine o'clock this morning. Friday looks at the man's police jacket. He has a been in and out jail for the last five years, name is Vernon Carney; his brother, Elwood Carney, is serving a year for car-stripping.

A time check off of Friday's watch is 8:34. Chief Brown asks if they are in on this case, simply a volunteer decision. A single man, Friday, chooses to handle the totally voluntary case. Romero has a family, says Friday, as Joe volunteers for the assignment. Romero says he can't go home, his wife wants him to paint the bathroom today. Romero stays. Chief Brown's instructions are simple, there's a man with a bomb in the next room, take it away from him. The Chief goes to check if everyone else is out of the building, he will be back in a minute, warning the men, Carney knows what he is doing, he is no pushover.

Friday narrates the two big questions: was Vernon Carney holding a real bomb or a harmless gadget; was Carney willing to set the bomb off by nine if his demand was not met. One thing for certain, they had only twenty-four minutes to talk him out of it. Friday looks at his watch, it was eight-thirty-six; both Sergeants enter Carney's location, labeled board room on the door. As they approach, Carney says that is far enough; the ticking sound is the bomb or the clock on the wall. Carney's stare, while seated with the bomb box in his lap, reflects he means business; a very cold stare. Romero tells him we are not going let your brother out of jail. Carney states you have until nine o'clock to change your mind, twenty-two minutes; the camera pans the clock on the wall.

The conversation intensifies among the two police officers and the perpetrator. By now, the Sergeants believe it is a real bomb Carney now has on the table, with his hand on the bomb mechanism. The clock showed nineteen minutes to go as the men leave to room joining the Chief in another area. Brown takes a call, the men listen, they found twenty-eight sticks of dynamite in Carney's apartment. Eighteen minutes before nine, the tension mounts for an answer. The screen goes to black.

Friday says the bomb is real, they can see through the glass window one end of the box. They didn't know if he had the nerve to pull the trigger, if it would go off if he did, but the sticks in his room at least validated dynamite was in his possession. Friday says his watch showed sixteen-and-a-half minutes to nine. The Sergeants and Chief talk in an adjacent room. Friday has an idea for someone to slug Carney entering from the outside window, the bomb squad could help with disarming the bomb afterward. They open their window to look at the ledge, eighteen inches wide, a strong wind could have the person torn away from the building, plummeting to certain death. Chief Brown says it is too risky, but with the help from the fire department's ladder, there might be a possibility of an alternative plan.

The dictagraph needs to be activated without Carney seeing the set-up. Friday heads for Carney's room. They convince Carney the dictagraph is needed for him to talk to his jailed brother, Elwood, there are no operators left in the building. The bomb-box remains in Carney's lap. The officers leave the room to help speed up the meeting between brothers. Carney mentions the receiver of the dictagraph is off the hook; Friday narrates the failure of the ruse. Friday and Romero exit the Carney room.

Sam Erickson, Fire Battalion Chief, Lt. Lee Jones, crime-lab, are in the room with Chief Brown. The new plan is to lower a man on a life line to the window. Somebody enters through the window, knocks Carney taking his hand away from the bomb-trigger. The bomb is placed in a bucket of water, Jones says the man elected will get the bomb out of the building as quickly as he can. Romero is picked to slug Carney, knocking him out; Friday is grab the bomb, placing it in the water-filled bucket. The Chief is getting Elwood on the phone to talk to his brother Vernon. Friday checked with the elevator operator, making certain the car is ready at their floor, then he dismissed him out of the building.

The Sergeants tell Carney they are getting his brother on the phone. Carney doesn't buy their story, picking up the phone, throwing it through the glass door, ordering the men to get Elwood out of jail. The Chief comes in, sees the broken glass, telling Carney it is his show, outside the Carney room is Chief Erickson, Lt. Jones with the water, set next to their door where Carney sits. Romero is outfitted with the ropes and belt. Chief Erickson says there is a twenty-mile-per-hour wind out there that could effect the plan.

Chief Brown asks Friday if he is scared; Friday says yes, the Chief replies that makes it even. The intention is to keep Carney's attention, while Ben lowers himself to the window, entering and slugging Carney. Friday answers Brown's time check, we got eight minutes left. A call is placed to the jail asking for Elwood Carney to appear. Vernon Carney orders the two to sit, they glance at one another, keeping Carney's attention away from the window behind him. The clock reads four-and-a-half minutes before nine. Romero's shoes makes a noise on the window, Carney notices, ordering the man be pulled back up. Request met, as Elwood enters the room, Carney greets his brother, after he latches the window shut.

Friday is told to get a car waiting for the brothers; Elwood tells Vernon we are going to need a gun when we get out of here. Romero decides to walk the ledge trying to knockout Vernon with his sap. He starts for the ledge, with Friday telling him to go the other window, Carney locked the one behind him. Elwood is going for the Chief's gun, Brown backs away from Elwood, Romero enters, hits Vernon with the sap, Brown slugs Elwood, Friday grabs the bomb, puts it in the bucket of water, runs to the elevator, operates it to the main floor, where he dashes for the door. Lt. Jones yells, down here Friday, he slips on the steps, losing his footing, falling, covering his head with his hands, the bomb falls out from the bucket. The bomb battery fizzles from being immersed. Lt. Jones hold the broken trigger mechanism, saying it would take a good yank to set off the bomb, being rigged for a strong trigger pull. Romero picks up a dynamite stick, one of many in the bomb box, now broken on the steps. Joe remains sprawled on the base of the steps, Brown crouches behind him, noticing the men are alright.

The suspect was examined by five different psychiatrists. They found him to be mentally incompetent. Vernon Carney is now confined in the State Mental Institution for the Criminally Insane. Elwood Carney served the balance of sentence with no time off for good behavior."

The concern was the stolen drugs could be spread around the city. Sister Benedict, pharmacy nurse, is interviewed, telling of the injured intern, Lyon. He was on the floor when she opened the pharmacy door that morning. The narcotics safe was emptied; she gives Romero a look at the inventory list of the safe's stolen drugs. Nine stitches to Lyon's head were required, he is resting in the hospital; the officers talk to Lyon, but he was hit from behind, not seeing his assailant. He could add nothing to what was already known. The entire hospital staff was questioned, screened. The narrative Friday provides reiterates the truth about the portioning of the purloined items to all addicts across the area; speed was a necessity in find the drugs based on street sale value.

At HQ, the officers talk to Sgt. Harlan Stall, crime lab-fingerprints, who tells the room and safe were clean of any prints; nothing to find. Captain Kearney enters the room, stating Babe Kellogg, junkie, is in the squad room, able to answer their questions. Lt. Louis Walters, checks the serial numbers against the found prescriptions with Kellogg. Kellogg thinks he is elsewhere, not LA. He is high on the drugs he recently took. Walters calls for the Captain to enter another room where he shows the serial numbers match those stolen earlier, as Friday looks on with Romero staying with Kellogg. The two vials found in Kellogg's car are both morphine. Leonard Castle, actor, sold drugs to Kellogg, who gave him up to police.

Friday checks with central casting, gets a set-location for Castle; he and Romero go the sound-stage where Castle is supposed to be filming. They find Castle. He says he doesn't know Kellogg; never heard of him. In between takes, Castle keeps stumbling over his responses to the inquiry from the Sergeants. He counts the currency in his wallet in plain view of the officers, saying he won some of it playing cards last night, and he got up at 5AM. Friday accuses him of selling Kellogg two vials of morphine for five-hundred. Asking Castle again, where he got the money. He cracks, saying he was sick once, his hospital was the same hospital he robbed, needing the fast money he owed. He confesses to the robbery, the rest of the money is in the car, he sold Babe Kellogg the two vials because he needed the money, as tears roll from his eyes. He was broke.

Ben takes Castle away, Joe listens to director Jack tell Friday Castle told a great story, but in front of the camera he goes to the dogs.

The detectives must find the missing baby before it's too late.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jack Webb'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Season 1 Episode 4 Synopsis - The Big Mother Aired 1-31-52 Sergeants Friday, Jacobs are working the night-watch out of Homicide, the boss is Captain Lohrman, the call they responded to was Mercy Hospital, the Superintendent of Nurses, made the call. The hospital nursery was left unattended for 90 seconds, in that time, a newly born baby was taken from its crib. How long could a three-day-old-baby survive in the hands of a kidnapper? The police had to find the new-born fast. It was raining, eleven-thirty PM, when the officers met with Doctor Walsh, Chief of Staff Mercy Hospital. Nurse O'Connor, in-charge of the nursery, when the infant went missing, as she went to take a phone call just feet away from the nursery. The missing infant was one of twins, belonging to the Stryker's. The mother had not been informed just yet, and the father was on his way to the hospital.

Steps were taken to notify every conceivable outlet for the missing baby, as Friday called in the status to HQ. It was midnight, a three-day-old-baby was taken from the hospital, for reasons unknown to anyone, but the perpetrator. The officers talk to George Stryker, asking if anyone he knows would do such a thing; promising he would notify the police if anyone contacts him about the baby. Sergeant Joe Olivas, another officer called on duty, asks Sergeants Friday, Jacobs and his partner Gill, to go to the side entrance, one such door was unlocked, or easily opened, because of a faulty lock, as Friday demonstrates. From the open side door, they traced the steps to the nursery. It proved someone would have been able to enter through that side door, go to the nursery, snatch a baby and exit by the same door without being seen by the attending duty-nurse. Shopkeepers along the Stacy Avenue entrance were alerted, no fingerprints were available on the wet door.

Back at the office, at 10AM the next morning, the press had been alerted, calls came in as expected, no leads turned up. Gill and Olivas greet the officers, leaving the squad room, when John Wallace enters the squad room. Wallace introduces himself as the 11th St. Blue Bird Hotel desk clerk. He says a woman checked in the hotel with a baby at midnight, no luggage, The officers go to the hotel with Wallace, knock on the door, no answer, they all enter, she is not in, nor is the baby. Her registered name is Mrs. Parks. Underneath the bed quilt is a blanket from Mercy Hospital, Friday shows Ed Jacobs. The place is checked for fingerprints, nothing. People in adjoining rooms were questioned, they all provided nothing. The hospital validated the blanket belonging to them. Other than registering as Mrs. Parks, there wasn't much to go on; the registration card was checked for handwriting and fingerprints, the Captain issued bulletins on the woman with a description from hotel employees. Three PM Friday, the search continued, Jacobs is on the phone with another dead end. Olivas, partner Gill, were at a drug store for coffee, a woman came in purchasing several baby related items, also asking the druggist if he could heat the formula for her.

A call comes in with neighbors claiming the Salazar's brought a baby home last night, but the blond baby does match Salazar's dark complexion. Sergeants Friday, Jacobs travel to the Salazar's, Friday says this could be like many of the calls they have experienced, or could be legit. They meet Frank Salazar at the door, they are having a baptismal party for his son, the house is full of guests. They go the infant's room, Friday glances at the boy, saying I think he has a twin. Footprints are taken of the baby's feet by Sergeant Harlan Stall, the prints match those of the missing baby. Interviewing Mrs. Salazar, she insists the baby in the other room was just brought on a flight from Phoenix last night. Jacobs, Friday say the hotel clerk can identify you and the druggist who waited on you. The baby's blanket matched, the color coat she wore last night matches; she is told, the baby belongs to a family called Stryker.

Roberta Salazar confesses to the crime, she got pregnant, had the baby in Phoenix, but the doctor later told her the baby had died, no explanation. After years of trying to have a baby, they were so happy she was pregnant, giving birth in Phoenix. After hearing from the doctor the baby had died shortly after his birth, she left the hospital, took the plane home, walked around thinking what to tell Frank. She says she walked past the hospital, went in the side door, when the nurse was gone, she took a baby, going to the hotel, until it stopped raining, then she took the baby home to her husband. Tears run down her cheeks, her husband exits, to tell the guests there has been a mistake. The officers say they think they can get it straightened out. All bow their heads, as the episode closes on a grim note; at the very least, the baby is safe, heading back to its rightful parents.

The subject woman was examined by five court-appointed psychiatrists and found to be under complete mental strain. By recommendation of the court, Roberta Salazar was admitted to the state mental institution, and later removed to a private sanitarium for further treatment."

The list of suspects was narrowed to one man, the last person known to see him alive. The officers had traced the suspect for months, finally the break came, they found him. Friday, Jacobs go the man's room, Henry Ross is his name. They identify themselves as police officers, they ask if he is Henry Ross, entering the room, the suspect breaks a chair over Jacobs, attempting to slug it out with Friday. Friday subdues him with punches, Jacobs cuffs him from behind, sits him in a chair. They order Ross to get dressed, they want to talk downtown, he brushes his teeth, while cuffed from the front. They ask about a missing Paul Davis, he responds, I knew a Davis, don't know if his name was Paul. His face is bleeding, as he finishes brushing, Friday wipes blood from his own face. Is something wrong, Ross asks. Friday responds, yeah, murder. After they search Ross's room thoroughly, they take him back to the interrogation room.

Ross was a longshoreman by trade, a heavy drinker, with a violent temper. Friday says Ed and I questioned Ross for a half-an-hour, they got nowhere. Friday explains the missing man's agenda to Ross, Davis' car was sold and he did not sell it. Davis was on his way up to another town to take a new job, but he never made it. That is when they found his car, not him. Davis's signature was forged on the car title. The forgery was signed by Henry Carter. Ross denies ever using an alias. Friday shows Ross the pink slip of the sold car, reading from Davis, seller, to Carter, buyer. Jacobs says the signatures are both in your handwriting. Ross keeps fiddling with a book of matches, denying the signatures are his, never seeing the pink slip before now. Friday claims the police handwriting expert says the signatures are from Henry Ross. Friday shows Ross a letter, which he denies is his handwriting.

The letter was written by Henry Carter to Paul Davis' wife, claiming the car was sold to someone and Carter had to write the letter. Davis has been gone four months, the police thinks he was murdered. Six men have been missing, taking off on auto trips, no trace of them to date; Ross is now tearing up the matchbook he was earlier fidgeting. Jacobs brings Henry's record from Baton Rouge to Friday; Friday reads to Henry. Friday tells Henry on June 4th Paul Davis left in his car, stopping for gas, accompanied by a man described by the station attendant meeting Ross's description. Friday continues to tell the story with two more stops of the car. After which, that is the last time Davis was seen alive, the people identify the man Davis was last seen with was Ross. The dealer buying the car identifies Ross' mug shot as the man selling the car as Henry Carter.

Ross asks Friday, Jacobs if they each think he murdered Davis. Friday and Jacobs say yes, they do think he killed Davis. Ross states there is only one way to prove if he is the murderer, find Davis' body. Mid-day, Friday, Jacobs took Henry Ross out and fed him lunch, then they all returned to the interrogation room. Ross talked about the different cases he read up on, all but talking about Davis. He never asked for an attorney, seemed calm as he talked. They made arrangements for a lie detector test that Ross consented, without hesitation. Sgt. Berger administered the polygraph test, then the three returned to the interrogation room.

Ross kept talking, the officers let him talk, it was eight PM. Ross says he liked reading about murder cases. Berger has the results of the polygraph, sixteen positive reactions to the test. Friday tells Henry, there were sixteen positive responses to the lie-detector test; he lied sixteen times. Ross asks Friday, Jacobs let's get something to eat, bring a map, I will tell you where I buried him.

At Henry's request, Helga's Health Shop was where he wanted to dine for his evening meal. The three sat down at Helga's, each man ordered something to eat; it was near closing time, Henry order the most food. Ross says he could write down the information. He did not know Davis from before, he was hitchhiking, Davis picked him up. He got the idea of killing him when they stopped for gas, and he saw a few bucks in his wallet.

Ross says you don't need any reason to kill somebody, Davis had eighteen bucks in his wallet, that is as good a reason as any. He admits killing Davis outside of Bakersfield, a little canyon there. He picked up a fifth of sherry in Bakersfield, got Davis to drink some of it. They stopped about two miles out of town, both fell asleep in a shack Ross had spotted.

Ross picked up a two-by-four, started to swing at faces he saw, about a dozen people's faces. The faces disappeared after he saw Davis on the floor; after he killed Davis. He says he buried Davis near the shack, burned his clothes and drove off. He admits to killing the other men in other towns, no reason given. Friday asks him about those killings Henry, any more you want to tell us about? Ross answers Friday, he told them already. He mentions one killing where he sold the car in Mexico, saying he wish he had done the same with Davis' car. Jacobs asks when the first killing was; Henry answers, maybe 18 months, two years ago. The first one wasn't any harder than the last. Ross says he was only bothered by the killings just that once, when was dreaming, saw faces, while he was sleeping in the shack with Davis. Ross thanks Friday for the meal.

The suspect was tried and found guilty of murder in the first degree. Henry Ross was executed in the lethal gas chamber of the State Penitentiary, San Quentin, CA."

The victim was a jewelry salesman, assaulted, robbed of $20,000 in precious stones.

It took a considerable time to gather evidence of the person suspected of the crime. The officers bring in Ernest Garvey for questioning. He denies having anything to do with the victim's robbery, claiming he was a friend of the victim, Thomas Ashley. Garvey says it was reported the assault came behind Ashley's business, next to Garvey's business. Ashley's sample case contents was stolen, $20,000 unset diamonds, and Garvey speaks of the crime, but denies anything to do with the case. Jacobs and Friday grill Garvey.

The officers are certain Garvey is their man, they have to get him to talk. The job was engineered by Garvey, he had someone pull the job and the cops know who he is, too. Garvey's spending habits, the major purchases he recent made all point to a change of lifestyle, only supported by the money gained from selling the stolen gems.

Friday, Jacobs feed Garvey with the facts of how the paid-for-robbery went down, based on surveillance they have in the form of tapes from every conversation he has had for months out of his office, including the young man he furnished with a gun to rob Ashely. They play a tape recording of the fence Garvey used to move the gems, and Garvey speaks about the young man pulling the job. The officers are quite clear to Garvey, they merely want a statement. He denied knowing Tyson, the holdup man, but the tape says otherwise. The fence he said he didn't know, but the tape tells a different story; he lied. The recordings are from the old dictographs, set in the walls by the police before Garvey moved into his office; no phone lines were tapped.

Friday plays another tape to jog Garvey's memory. The tape is a conversation of Tyson asking for his remaining $500 balance for pulling the job. Garvey says it is a fake. He calls their bluff. Friday says he bluff is bad, and he is booked in. The questioning continued, Garvey's answers became more confused. He is asked about his new car purchase and his wife's new fur; where did he get the money? He says he borrowed some of it. Records show loans from three banks total in the thousands, but Garvey made around fifteen-hundred. Multiple bank accounts show savings unaccounted for, per his business income statement; the police want to know where the money in the savings accounts came from, when Garvey wants to call his wife. His first try gets a busy signal; he tries again, busy, a third time, busy. Friday tells him about his expenses and they do not jibe with his income, including the loans.

Jacobs plays a tape of Tyson demanding his money after the robbery, while Garvey makes another attempt to call home, but gets a busy signal. He finally admits his wife's demands of improving their household income in order to buy better things became too much. The robbery of the diamonds was to shut her demands up. She spent every bit, he did not have enough to pay Tyson his $500. He asks to be booked in now. A last minute busy signal from home; Friday had said the police will take his statement down the hall, for the record.

Ernest Garvey was tried, convicted for robbery in the first degree and is now serving his term in the State Penitentiary, San Quentin, CA."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0565730/?ref_=ttep_ep13,,"Friday and Jacobs are called to the apartment of a man who phoned in the fatal shooting of his wife. He claims it was suicide, but upon looking at the crime scene and talking to neighbors they begin to wonder if it was murder.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Jack Webb'],[''],[],"['suicide', 'shell casing', 'murder investigation', 'forensic science', 'ballistics']",[],"Season 1 Episode 13 Synopsis - The Big Casing Aired 6-5-52 Friday, Jacobs are working day-watch Homicide Detail, it was Sunday, March 9th, called to the apartment of a man claiming the death of his wife was suicide, evidence indicated murder. Lt. Harry Fremont informs the men what he found so far, being the first officer on the scene. Husband, Andy Robertson, explains he was arguing with his wife, he went to the store, came back, the words continued, she went to the drawer, where the .45 was kept. She said to Andy, this will put an end to the argument once and for all. She then pulled the trigger. Her dead body is shown on the kitchen floor. Robertson went to his wife, saw she shot herself, went to the neighbor to call police, came down to his apartment, waited, sitting on the couch for the police.

Lt. Lee Jones, from the crime lab, enters the apartment, goes right to the body in the kitchen, while Lt. Harry Fremont escorts Robertson to HQ for his statement and further questioning. Lt. Jones notices the steak to be prepared lying in flour on the cutting board, the spent casing is out on the carpeting, not in the expected position with the deceased. George Wright, crime photographer, enters, Friday removes the plate he used to cover the casing on the rug. Wright takes the photos, steps aside. Jones, with Friday holding the tape, measures the distance from the dead woman's feet to the casing in the living room. Friday, Jacobs leave Harry and Lee in the apartment, taking the elevator to the neighbor upstairs.

Friday, Jacobs visit with the neighbor, Ted Carleton, where Andy, not having a phone, went to call the police. Neighbor Ted says the arguments were frequent, speculating Andy probably killed his wife, based on what he has heard over the two years he knew them. Ted continues to talk to the police, indicating he thought the likelihood of Andy pulling the trigger. Friday uses Ted's phone, calling HQ. There is no record on either Robertson. Joe, Ed questioned neighbors, including the apartment manager, the stories agreed concerning the Robertson's; they argued frequently and were quite loud. Nobody in the building ever heard Andy threaten his wife.

The officers went back to the interrogation room to further question Andy Robertson. Andy does not seem to be particularly upset about his wife. He explains over the eight years of marriage, things were not right from the start, but the last two years they drifted apart. He says he could not stop his wife after she grabbed his pistol from the drawer, it happened too fast. It was Sunday, he liked to sleep in on Sundays. He was asked to go to the store; he didn't like that, which started the arguing. He recounts the actions prior to the death of his wife. The story is the same, to the detail. Both officers tell him they think he killed his wife; he denies it. Jacobs tells him the neighbors all vouch for the arguments they heard. The empty casing found in the living room does not figure with the operation of that pistol. The casing should have been on the kitchen floor after it ejected. The flour seen on the cutting board where the wife was about to coat the steak was on the barrel of the gun, not on the butt. A policeman takes Robertson's statement about his wife committing suicide. All evidence is collected, charted, relatives interviewed, fingerprints taken of Andy and his wife.

Lieutenant Jones shows Friday, Jacobs final pictures of the crime scene, including the actual casing and another same casing. The actual casing has a dent, the sample casing does not. The husband said he went to his wife after the shot, he inadvertently stepped on the spent casing, as the Lieutenant demonstrates with a piece of linoleum. More evidence shows a flour sack on top of the wastebasket in the kitchen, indicating the possibility of the gun falling from her hand after the shot, striking the sack on the way to the floor. She wiped her hands on the apron before she got the gun, explaining why no flour on the gun butt. Evidence of the powder burns from her skull, the spent bullet lodged in the cabinet, all indicate she shot herself from close range; not likely the case if she was shot by someone else. A struggle would have likely ensued, not leaving the same powder burns, furthermore the angle from the lodged bullet, considering the woman's height, the evidence points to suicide with the weapon from the drawer.

Friday takes a call from Lieutenant Fremont. Mrs. Robertson's mother had a letter written by her daughter indicating in the past, she spoke about taking her own life. The mother is certain her daughter committed suicide. Friday, Jacobs are headed back across the street to talk to Andy Robertson and Lieutenant Jones wants to be there when they tell him it was suicide; he is innocent, as he told the officers previously.

The coroner's report exonerated Andrew Robertson of any complicity in the death of his wife and he was released from custody."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0565827/?ref_=ttep_ep14,,Friday after a safe burglar on the loose.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Jack Webb'],[''],[],"['safecracker', 'police', 'los angeles california', 'burglary', 'detectives']",[],"Season 1 Episode 14 Synopsis - The Big Lamp Aired 6-19-52 Friday, Jacobs are in Superior Court, where an ex-con is on trial for burglary of a safe on the third floor of an office building. Evidence is over-whelming pointing the man committing the crime, i.e. his shoe size, shoe make, shoe cleats, debris on his pants from the building, paint on his shoe-soles from the building fixtures, etc. The odds pointing to any other individual other than the ex-con are greater than the population of the earth since time began. Friday expects a quick verdict, instead the jury was locked up for the night, all went home. Next morning, the ex-con, Conrad Buckley, was found not-guilty by the jury. The judge said he thought this was the worst miscarriage of justice in all his years in the court system; telling the jurors either you are innately dishonest or you are complete morons. Court was adjourned.

A complete background check was conducted on each juror as directed from the District Attorney's Office; nothing came of it. None of the jurors were fixed, proven by the DA's investigation; the juror's didn't care, as Lieutenant Jones said. Friday comments to Lt. Jones, he thinks it stinks. The jurors took an apathetic view of the whole trial, as witness to their verdict. After all the hard evidence accrued for the case, the time it took getting it together to go to trial, it was an injustice perpetrated by the jury; Joe put it best. Word was the ex-con, named Buckley, left town for out East, then disappeared in a year's time.

It is February 1, of the new year, Captain Wisdom comes into the squad room, reporting another burglary just occurred, a printing company was robbed last night, all methods point to Conrad Buckley. Wisdom puts it plain to Joe and Ed, get him this time. Wisdom adds I don't know if that Greek with the lamp ever found an honest man, but get the guy.

Joe Friday, Ed Jacobs went out to the Cotter Printing Company spending the better part of the day going through the trail of possible evidence from the fourteen-thousand dollar safe burglary. Buckley entered through the skylight into the safe room; left no fingerprints. The Captain says to tail him starting with his favorite bar, where he was seen recently. Also, Buckley is now carrying a gun. The stakeouts began, at his home, tailing his friends, anything and anyone connected with him was followed.

Friday, Jacobs sit outside Comanchee's Bar for three nights, no sign of him; the fourth night at 8:10PM he showed, entering the bar. The officers waited. At 12:25 AM Buckley exits, accompanied by a blond woman on his arm, Buckley is walking unsteadily. The plate number is noted and ran; Nine Robert 702 is reported back to the men, car belonging to Mrs. Conrad Buckley, Beverly Hills. Friday, Jacobs trailed the Buckley's to the house; at 3 another group of detectives was dispatched to relieve Joe and Ed.

Conrad's movements were established by the end of that week as the Captain was charting on the squad room map. Wisdom assigned teams of men to trail Buckley's moves; on Tuesday he made his move and Friday, Jacobs were on him. Friday, Jacobs are joined by Wisdom as they sit in the car waiting on Buckley. The Captain said he left on foot, probably returning, since his car is in the driveway. A woman exits the house, gets into the car, the guys follow, she stops at an apartment house, later a man walks out with her, they get into the car, he drives. It is Buckley driving, says the Captain; Jacobs says this must be their hideout. The Captain instructs the officers to follow and shake them down, he will check the apartment, they are to meet later at the office. Friday, Jacobs find nothing in the house, the place is clean, after searching the suspect.

The Captain found two changes of clothes, hidden tools at the apartment. The unit is rented by Buckley under a false name. The only belongings are ones the captain found; tools were under a false bottom drawer. The plan is to watch both residences, the apartment is likely where Buckley would show after a job. There he would change, feeling he was safe from the law. Stakeouts prevailed at both locations, nothing out of the ordinary.

A wholesale grocer was burglarized of $7,500. Lt. Jones shows the Captain and the officers a chemical rubbed on a cloth that can't be detected by feel and can only seen under ultraviolet light as glowing when under the light only. Joe tries it to prove it works; the Lt. says it will work on Buckley. Officers Jones, Friday and Jacobs enter the apartment, dusting everywhere with the chemical, including clothes and tools.

The Captain gets the call of a safe job, two of them. An ultraviolet lamp is brought to the crime scene, the Lieutenant smiles as white hand prints appear on the burglarized safe. They all go the apartment, shining their light on his tools and clothes; they all contain white powder. The Lieutenant describes step by step Buckley's moves at the job in which he was acquitted, promising later, to be able to recount his moves on tonight's job. Conrad complains about his soiled clothes. Friday comments where he is going by the time he gets out they will be out of style. Buckley is arrested.

Suspect was tried and convicted on first-degree burglary, and due to his previous convictions, he was sentenced to life in prison. Conrad Buckley is now serving a life term in the State Penitentiary, San Quentin, CA."

He greets John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, who has brought his son Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, to accuse Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, of treason. The two are willing to fight, but Richard implores them to make peace. When they refuse, the king sets a date for a duel between the two at Coventry.

The two prepare for their battle. At Coventry, Bolingbroke asks for a final kiss from Richard, which is granted, and Bolingbroke and Mowbray mount their horses. They reject lances, and begin their attack armed with a mace and a sword. Before they meet, the king throws down his warder and stops the battle. He orders them back to his pavilion, where he sets a sentence of banishment for the two: ten years for Bolingbroke, but life for Mowbray. They swear to forego meeting again, and also to forego rebellion against Richard. Richard then cuts four years from Bolingbroke's sentence out of respect for his father.

Later, Richard asks of his cousin, the Duke of Aumerle and son and heir of the Duke of York, how Bolingbroke left the land, and comments that he, as well as courtiers Bushy, Bagot, and Green, had seen Bolingbroke courting the common people as though he were king. Richard then makes plans to leave for Ireland to put down rebellions there, and ruminates on the problems of paying for soldiers. A messenger comes to tell him that John of Gaunt is grievously ill. Richard thinks of this as good news, as he would like to take John's assets in service of the war. The court goes to visit John.

At Ely House, the home of John of Gaunt, John wishes for the king to come. The Duke of York comments that the king takes advice from no one, but John hopes he may listen to a dying man. The king arrives, and Gaunt rebukes him for leasing out the lands of England for money. Richard angrily draws his sword and a fight almost ensues, but he leaves. Northumberland runs after him to tell him that John of Gaunt has passed away, and Richard makes plans to seize his assets. York protests, saying that they should pass to Bolingbroke, and warns Richard that seizing the assets may foment rebellion. Richard ignores the advice, but makes York Governor of England in his absence, hoping to secure York's loyalty. Northumberland, Ross, and Willoughby discuss the king's shortcomings, and Northumberland reveals that Bolingbroke is returning to England to attempt a coup.

As the queen sits for a painting, Bushy and Green reveal that Bolingbroke has arrived back in England. York is at a loss of how to defend the crown. Bushy, Green, and Bagot debate what to do; Bushy and Green make for Bristol Castle for refuge, while Bagot makes for Wales to rouse the Welsh troops for the king.

In the woods, Bolingbroke and Northumberland discuss plans, when York arrives and rebukes them, hoping to turn them from their path of rebellion. Bolingbroke begs York's indifference, telling him that he looks upon him as a father, and that he claims the title Duke of Lancaster. York is unable to stop them, but tells them that he cannot support them and will remain neutral.

In Wales, the army has mustered at the call of the Earl of Salisbury, but after waiting ten days for Richard's appearance, they return home, assuming he is dead.

Bolingbroke returns to Ely House, finding it barren. His men capture Bushy and Green. Bolingbroke accuses them of misleading the king and has them beheaded.

Richard finally arrives in Wales. Aumerle warns him that Bolingbroke is strong, but Richard assumes that his majestic presence will quell the rebellion. Salisbury tells him that the Welsh army has dispersed. Sir Stephen Scroop arrives to tell him that the war is going poorly. Richard asks after Bushy and Green, and upon finding they are dead, despairs. Aumerle recommends inquiring of his father, the Duke of York, but Scroop tells Richard that York has also gone to Bolingbroke's side and all of the northern castles are lost. Richard makes plans to take refuge at Flint castle.

Later, Bolingbroke and Northumberland arrive at Flint Castle. Bolingbroke sends a message to Richard suggesting he will support Richard if his banishment is repealed. They meet, and Richard unwillingly agrees to Bolingbroke's terms. They plan to return to London.

In Langley, the Queen and her lady-in-waiting listen to gardeners gossiping. They suggest King Richard will be deposed, much to the Queen's horror. She also makes plans to go to London.

Later, in Westminster Hall, Bolingbroke, already Duke of Lancaster, is informed that Richard has abdicated and named Bolingbroke his successor - now King Henry IV. The bishop of Carlisle objects, and is arrested forthwith. Bolingbroke summons Richard who gives him the royal crown, although admitting his ambivalence. Henry asks him if he is sure that he wants to resign, and Richard affirms it. Northumberland gives Richard an accusation that he is required to read and accept, to show that he was deposed for cause. Richard asks for a looking-glass to see how his no-longer-royal face looks. He breaks the glass to indicate the ephemerality of kingship. Henry sends him to the Tower and orders plans made for his coronation.

At the Tower, the Queen waits for Richard. Aumerle confers with the Abbot of Westminster and the Bishop of Carlisle; they plan to recover the crown for Richard. Richard tells the Queen to fly to France. Northumberland meets Richard and tells him that Henry has decided to send him to Pomfret rather than the Tower. The Queen asks that Richard be sent to France or that she be allowed to go to Pomfret, a request which is denied.

At the palace of the Duke of York, York and the Duchess discuss the coronation and humiliation of Richard. Their son the former Duke of Aumerle - now demoted for his friendship to Richard - enters and York asks to see a letter he has. York is shocked to find the letter holds a plot to kill Henry at Oxford, and makes plans to immediately go to Henry and warn him, over the objections of the Duchess. She urges Aumerle to go to the King himself and ask forgiveness before York can reach him. York and Aumerle reach Henry at the same time, and Henry forgives the son for the sake of the father - over York's objections. The Duchess of York also arrives at the throne room to plead for Aumerle. Henry forgives Aumerle but plans to destroy the other traitors at Oxford.

Aumerle now is convinced Henry has ordered him to remove Richard as a threat. At Pomfret Castle, Richard muses upon his fate. A groom comes to see him and they discuss the royal horse, Barbary. Aumerle appears and kill Richard.

Back at Windsor Castle, Northumberland brings the heads of the traitors Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent. Willoughby has taken the heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely, and Percy brings the body of the Abbot of Westminster and the Bishop of Carlisle, still alive. Henry forgives him. Aumerle enters bearing the coffin of Richard. Henry is displeased, and, guilt-stricken, plans a penitent voyage to the Holy Land."
