https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1518921/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,"Jules always seems to be with her friends, her ex or her son. One night when everyone is busy, she reluctantly takes a date with an older man just to get out of the house, so Grayson makes her a wager that she can't spend a whole day by herself.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Michael McDonald'],"['', '', '']",[],"['dare', 'diving', 'swimming pool', 'monster', 'father son relationship', 'bare chested male', 'dinner']",[],"Jules was in the middle of a very hot dream when the neighbor's dog interrupts her. Apparently, she had a sex dream about Grayson...and decides to tell him about it. (I thought she was supposed to be smart. NEVER tell a guy you had a sex dream about him unless you ACTUALLY want to have sex with him!) She tries to play it off by saying she's had sex dreams about a lot of people. But she needs Grayson to talk to Mr. Rose, who owns the yappy dog. Jules and he don't really talk because of competing yard sales the previous year. Grayson not-so-politely declines.

At work, Larry, a mortgage broker, is charming Jules. He thinks they can go out for coffee, but Jules politely declines, saying she's playing chess tonight with the homeless. (Laurie actually says that.) She really doesn't want to go on a date with someone ""who I wish was my father."" Granted, she thinks he was quite a stud in his day, but Larry's days apparently end by 7:40 PM. Jules wakes him up at that time to take him up on the offer for coffee. She doesn't really have a choice. It's date night with Ellie and Andy, and she's even forgiven him for leaving his hair all over the sink. Laurie has a date with a guy who needs to get his CD collection back from his ex, and Travis is with Bobby tonight. They have fireworks and a pumpkin.

The coffee date is over, and Jules has gone years since being in a car that had no lap belt. Unfortunately, Grayson and his much younger date saw the whole thing. He is more than happy to tell Jules she can't stand to be alone. She tries to deny it, naturally. But Grayson and his imitation of Adam Sandler on the guitar bets her she can't spend an entire day alone. The bet is on...and over as Bobby and Travis show up. She kicks them out, and Grayson gives her a mulligan.

She starts off OK. She separates all the coins in a large coin jar, throws out some of her bad choices in perfume, and even gets into her old prom dress. (And across America, 40-somethings are giving Courteney the finger right now.) She checks the time, and all of that took 22 minutes. She has a swim, and is forced to call Andy to get rid of the crocodile that came into her yard. Laurie finally figures out where she spent the previous night, and Jules has to drive her home. However, she covers for herself with Grayson by making Laurie sit way down in the car.

JULES: It is so much more fun to be alone when you're with someone.

Laurie decides to stay, and Jules decides to recall Bobby and Travis. Bobby already started the grill, but somehow roman candles really don't marinate meat well. Although beer and pepper does, as he demonstrates. This gives Travis a chance to make conversation with Laurie. SPF 90 sunblock is such a turn-on, isn't it? Everybody has to use their inside voices outside, so no Laurie talk about her dates, no music for Travis, and no marriage counseling for Andy, who got kicked out by Ellie for leaving his hair in the sink. But everything is fine...until a rogue M-80 firecracker makes it into the grill. The bet is lost.

Now that the bet is over, Jules wants Grayson to stay for the barbecue and meet the neighbors. He declines and guitars his way out. Jules tries to get Bobby to bring him back, but Bobby's hearing still hasn't fully recovered. Laurie decides to bend Travis' ear about her date, Dale. He has a steady job forging Dan Marino's autograph for a living. She is left with Andy, and Jules has to take his side of an argument to get him to retrieve Grayson. But Grayson has a good argument on his side: he's watching ""Rudy."" (I gotta give him that one. The scene when Ned Beatty sees Notre Dame Stadium for the first time...very emotional.) Jules comes over and counters the best guy movie of all time (No, Brian's Song is) with The Shawshank Redemption. And Andy and Bobby will get the ""Full Shawshank Experience."" They get to climb through a tunnel into the pool like Andy Dufresne, complete with Jules' imitation of Morgan Freeman narrating and using the spray nozzle on the hose to make it rain.

Bobby is touched by Andy's Andy imitation. He talks to Ellie about throwing Andy a bone, just like Jules does for him. She doesn't think it will mean anything if she does, but Bobby convinces her it will. Jules convinces Grayson to come over since he already knows Travis, Andy, and Bobby very well. He might as well take the full plunge. Travis finally convinces Laurie to get rid of her boyfriend."

The fact that the women of the town have gone Scarlet Letter on her because of her divorce, shorter skirts, and younger boyfriends, the decision is made to out out of town for a night, leaving Grayson, Travis, and Andy to fend for themselves. Grayson negotiates a 3-day reprieve from her editorials on his dates to keep an eye on Travis, and Andy wonders how women can pack a car full of stuff for one night away.

They get to the resort and it doesn't take long for Laurie and Ellie to be at odds. However, Jules insists on them not arguing and that she will refer to herself in the third person all weekend. Resort Jules will also eat bacon in her bikini by the pool. And she'll also let Laurie invite a few guys over to sit with them. (OK, 7.) However, neither form of Jules wants Travis to have any girls in the house, which he promptly violates. Grayson even gives him the ""hit that"" nod, in spite of Andy's warning that Jules gets vengeful when people let Travis bend the rules a bit. Grayson passes it off initially, but then he bucks up and ruins Travis' night. Travis is clearly not happy, especially when Grayson tries to give him the ""sex should be special"" speech. But it turns out that the speech was irrelevant because Travis didn't think he was going to get anywhere with Kylie. Travis is convinced that he doesn't like girls. Grayson is shocked and tries to be supportive. From across the house, Andy is on the phone to Jules within 3 seconds. It seems Travis has pulled a stunt like this before and Andy is ratting on him. Apparently Travis has a ""hot butterflies"" story already concocted, and Jules loves the fact that Travis is messing with Grayson.

Unfortunately, one of the ladies who froze her out earlier was at the resort with her husband. Shanna was none too happy about Jules greeting Frank while she was wearing a white bikini that could win a wet t-shirt contest. Worse, Shanna once gave Frank the ""if I died, which one of my friends would you sleep with"" question that men hate, and Frank was dumb enough to answer honestly. (Really, are husbands THAT dumb?) It would seem Jules is a ""bitch magnet."" Ellie and Laurie are no help, as they will take her out tonight...separately. Jules has had enough and decides to go out on their own. She has a rotten time and still can't convince anybody she's 34. Several mojitos and a round for the bar later, she meets the valet that took them up to their room. She's happy to see Trent from Tallahassee, but it turns out he's gay. She tells him not to ruin it for her. He relents and dances with her while Laurie and Ellie patch up their differences in the hotel room over some champagne. Trent from Tallahassee tries, but the fact they're the only ones dancing...and he's wearing the same perfume as her...makes Jules want to pack it in. Trent from Tallahassee goes ""Dancing With the Stars"" on her and she is happy. She'd appreciate him forgetting to be gay for one night, but no such luck.

Of course, the night is still young and can be ruined. After an aborted attempt earlier to hot tub naked, courtesy of a man with ""moobs"" and another who's hands never came up for air, Frank and Shanna decide to finish watching porn in their room and enter the hot tub. Shanna immediately has a hissy fit about Jules being in the hot tub when she and Frank want to go in, and she intends to put both barrels behind the gossiping when they get back. It was time for Laurie and Ellie to defend Jules, and they proceed to beat the living crap out of Shanna if she ever gossips. Jules is proud that Laurie and Ellie buried the hatchet just for her. Unfortunately, she could smell the horse hockey when they talked about both having horses as kids. But Laurie and Ellie do promise to always have Jules' back, even if they won't have each other's backs.

Certainly Grayson wishes Travis wasn't coming out to him. But as it turns out that Grayson tries to be supportive and confesses he practiced kissing with one of his male cousins once. Now Travis is well-armed with information, so Grayson can't c-block him when Kylie returns to take him out on a date. But if it's any consolation, Andy marched in two gay pride parades to keep his secret."

The three-point plan: locate the item, justify the purchase, and hide it so nobody else gets it two days from now. This will be Jules' first post-divorce party, and she wants to keep it small. And by two minutes in, the whole gang is invited because she secretly likes having big Thanksgiving parties that make her look like she saved everybody's Thanksgivings. (No really, bring more Monica Geller foibles on to this show.) Granted, Grayson fished for an invite, which Jules happily gave. But when he went non-committal about it, she's going to force him to beg for it. He doesn't want to, but Bobby is apparently quite persuasive. Certainly they're better at it than their ""we're not over the hill"" basketball game, complete with the subtle sexual undertones of the ""Top Gun"" volleyball game. (If this show is aimed at women, why are there so many references to guy movies?)

While Andy and Bobby get ready for the drinking and dinner by pretending to be Joey and Chandler at Thanksgiving, that is if Chandler's cholesterol count was over 300. Bobby doesn't want Andy to say anything to Jules and promises to keep it a secret. That is, until Ellie walks in. It turns out Andy gets severe heartburn when he tries to keep a secret from Ellie. He tells Ellie, Ellie tells Jules, and Bobby is officially on a diet. However, Ellie is not done. She browbeats Bobby and Grayson about their lifestyles. (She's mean!) But the two realize that they hope they'll eventually find someone special, someone real, mature, someone they can spend the rest of their lives with. Like the one Bobby divorced and Grayson despises.

The big news is that Travis is bringing Kylie over for the dinner. Travis goes over the rules: no anorexic talk from Ellie, Andy must keep his pants on, Laurie cannot remind Kylie her breasts are bigger, no guitar from Grayson, and mom and dad can't say one word. Naturally, they don't take this lying down and proceed to embarrass the hell out of Travis the minute Kylie walks in. While Laurie and Ellie play divide and conquer with Kylie, Jules wants Travis to make sure she's the one, and insists on having the same sex talk she's had with him 4 times a year since he was 9. He draws the line at practicing putting a condom on the rolling pin. (Thank God.) But Travis assuring Jules that it won't be after Thankgiving dinner, since it will be at Kylie's parents' house tomorrow night hardly calms her.

JULES: What kind of a mother lets her daughter wear a slutty Cardigan when she's not even on the pill? Whore!

Jules is determined to have a sex talk right then and there to prove condoms can break. She fills one like a water balloon and tries to break it. And smashes it on the ground. And tries to poke it with a knife. She explains to the freaked-out pairing that Travis told her that he and Kylie would be having sex the next night and she was trying to be proactive. Kylie is mortified she does that and leaves quickly. Travis berates her and also leaves. THEN the condom breaks.

Monica...sorry, Jules...is devastated by what she did and wants someone to help her that day, because she still wants to be the hero who saved Thanksgiving. Since Kylie left her purse by mistake, Monica...sorry, Jules...will hold it hostage so Kylie can't leave. She starts to bury the purse outside, and Kylie witnesses the entire event on a chaise behind her. Jules tries to talk to Kylie, while Laurie will stop anything inappropriate. Obviously that plan doesn't work, because Jules outs Travis on never having had sex before. Jules gives up and hands Kylie back her purse. She hopes Kylie stays because Travis really likes her. Ellie tries to convince Travis that Jules has his best interests because she confesses not knowing much about parenting and uses Jules as a guide. Travis can't believe she does that, until Kylie comes up ready to talk to him. Travis goes to help Jules set the table and ready the turkey."

Meanwhile, Bobby tries to bond with Grayson, and Ellie lets Andy take care of their baby for the day.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['John Putch'],"['', '', '']",[],"['gym', 'boy', 'bare chested male']",[],"Jules and Ellie head out to their spinning class, leaving Andy to take care of little Stan. Naturally, Ellie has to give him full instructions on how to take care of Stan, but Andy is convinced he can take care of the little guy. Before Jules can, she must remind Laurie not to describe her new house to a client as ""slammin'."" However, the new client, Jeff (Scott Foley), is giving both Laurie and Jules the runaround when it comes to buying the house. Laurie can't stand it, but Jules just thinks of Jeff as a ""tiny little person wearing tiny little pants,"" and it's water off of a duck's back to her. (which won't last, of course) Meanwhile, she wants to date Shirtless Jeans Model from her spinning class, and not the model they keep in the back of the store. After Jules finally gets a date with him by acting less like herself, their date at a sports bar on steroids doesn't go well. However, the model does have aspirations to be on the next ""Real World/Road Rules Challenge."" It also turns out he likes guys, but Laurie hangs in there just to see if the guy is really bisexual and maybe get herself a little bit. (He isn't, and she didn't.)

Andy's performance with Stan leads to a discussion with Ellie, where she decides to let him take care of Stan for the day. With Travis' help, they make a fort for Stan, or a baby cage, as State Family Services might call it. It may be made of two couches and a glass table, but Stan's bottle is always at the ready for him, kind of like a little gerbil. He also decides to give the crawling Stan the freedom to crawl...up to 18 feet, thanks to a series of electrical cords he linked to Stan. (Relax, he got all sharp corners out of range.) One time, the cords start to pull too hard, and Andy tries to pull in his marlin. It was Ellie on the other end. She is furious, but she relents in getting mad at him because he is too easy-going and she needs to be, which makes them the perfect parenting team. That, plus she accidentally tripped and fell while carrying Stan, so the little guy now has a cut on his head thanks to her.

Grayson is depressed about something, and Bobby is determined to find out what is wrong. Grayson doesn't want to talk about it, but obviously that won't stop Bobby from harassing him by using some of Jules' former logic on him, invading his bar during off-hours, and even making Grayson come up on the boat. In the end, Grayson breaks down. In desperate need of some booze, he confides to Bobby that his ex-wife just had her kid. They broke up because he wanted kids and she didn't, but obviously her being a new mom was a particularly harsh thing to deal with. Bobby is more proud that Grayson finally owned up as opposed to being supportive of Grayson, but at least he had plenty of booze for Grayson.

It turns out Jeff had designs for Jules. After antagonizing Jules for the 10th time while seeing the same house, he decides to kiss her. In spite of replying back with her lips, Jules is furious he did that. The smug Jeff thinks that Jules might be attracted to him, but she can't handle his arrogance. Her choices are to go with Shirtless Jeans Model or the older Scott. Jules is afraid because a relationship with Scott would be the real thing, which meant a chance to really get hurt again. After much soul-searching (and the 12th walkthrough of the same house), she decides she wants the real thing. She kisses him."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571031/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,"Jules becomes jealous when she learns that her cruel dermatologist is seeing Bobby, Andy gives Travis a lesson about understanding women, and Laurie lets politics get in the way of a potential hookup.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Millicent Shelton'],"['', '', '']",[],"['male bonding', 'love', 'scolding', 'jealousy']",[],"Can a woman call up a complete stranger and get them to agree to have sex? DUH!! Of course, the guys won the bet. Grayson, Andy, and Jeff were out with Jules, Laurie, and Ellie. (Wait, 3 men and 3 women out together talking? This sounds like the makings of a good show. I wonder if anybody else has thought of this.) But apparently, Jules really likes Jeff because she gave up playing her favorite game of Scrabble to have sex with him. Or it was the fact she thinks he's way smarter than her. But then, that's part of the ""mask"" women put on, as Jules explains to Travis. Women display this ""image"" of what they think guys want, which wears off after marriage. (""Morning sex? Yuck!"")

Jules and Ellie head to the dermatologist for some Botox treatments. (Ellie apparently gets a volume discount.) Her method for dealing with the mean Dr. Evans is avoiding eye contact and mumbling. Jules plans to kill her with kindness. Five seconds with Dr. Evans (Lisa Kudrow) and Jules is also mumbling and avoiding eye contact, mainly because Jules has enough going on to buy Dr. Evans a new steam shower. Dr. Evans is most adept at dermatology...and stringing together many an insult. However, Jules needs her services (and is probably the only person to think that). She confesses to Bobby later on that she needed the ""Queen Bitch,"" and Dr. Evans emerges from Bobby's boat to agree liking the name Queen Bitch. ""Makes me sound like the leader of the gays.""

""Black is white, yin is yang! DeVito's tall, Jon is Kate!"" Both Travis and Laurie enter Grayson's bar in business suits, although Laurie does have her blouse wide open with no bra to speak of. (And thank you for that, Ms. Phillips.) The other man at the bar doesn't turn her on, especially when he goes by his last name of Smith. However, Grayson corrects her on that, and tells her he's loaded. Mission accomplished. Unfortunately, Smith wants to take her to a political function at his father's country club, and she's nervous.

GRAYSON: Wow, it's like ""Pretty Woman.""

LAURIE: Acutally, it's more like ""Mystic Pizza,"" but either way I get to be Julia Roberts, so bite me.

However, Laurie is a little intimidated by the whole political process, despite Grayson trying to explain the differences between Republicans and Democrats. And the fact that Ellie thinks that even Bobby shouldn't date someone so far out of his league like Dr. Evans, who doesn't even like him in the sack, convinces Laurie to break her date with Smith.

Andy decides to take Travis under his wing and teach him a thing or two about women. (uh-oh) He demonstrates that Ellie is rather vulnerable right now having gotten back from the dermatologist by intentionally making Ellie overreact and yell at him. He feels that she'll make it up to him later, especially after he finds her necklace, which he just hid. Observing Jules at her office after she had told off Dr. Evans, Andy indicates to Travis that this is always the best time to ask a woman to have sex. (not in this case, obviously, but...) Another piece of advice: if a woman has ""misplaced lady rage,"" as Laurie just had with Travis, he should find out the source of the rage and agree with her on it. This actually works. And Travis and Laurie's highly-inappropriate-but-still-cute flirtation continues.

Not wanting to see Bobby hurt, Jules confronts Dr. Evans, who actually agrees with Jules about Bobby being bad in bed. But Jules still tells her to back off. Dr. Evans is a bit impressed that Jules stood up to her, but apparently not enough to stop seeing Bobby. The fact that Dr. Evans was in her house with Bobby was proof of that. As was the request for more Chardonnay...and better Chardonnay.

Jules decides to get back at Dr. Evans by dropping in on Bobby's boat unexpectedly. However, she has to drag Jeff with her, although he's happy he can get another vase of wine from the cooler. (Seriously, a cooler like you see on the sidelines at a football game.) Jules' biggest problem is Dr. Evans talking down to everybody, but Bobby doesn't care. Nor does Jeff, who tries to assuage her fears of not being as smart as Dr. Evans.

According to Andy, whose advice really seems to work, women always drive men crazy or try to outsmart them to protect themselves and not get hurt. This is true for Laurie, who was finally convinced Smith Frank (seriously, that was his name) was strictly interested in her for her butt, boobs, and face, in that order. Dr. Evans stopped talking down to Bobby when she saw what he brought her examination table, and Jules finally got the courage to play Scrabble against Jeff, although she stuck to the three-letter words.

ANDY: They almost miss out on the stuff they fell they're not good enough for. But every once in a while, they find the courage to be themselves, and it is worth the wait."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568963/?ref_=ttep_ep12,,"Jules freaks out when she decides to be exclusive with Jeff, which makes Bobby and Grayson jealous, Meanwhile, Laurie seeks revenge sex with an unsuspecting stranger, and Travis and Grayson try to save her.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Chris Koch'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Things seem to be going well with Jules and Jeff, so she takes him on the ultimate relationship/no relationship test: dinner with Ellie and Andy. Of course, the ladies want to talk all night, and the guys will occupy their time by playing ""Penny Can,"" where you try to toss a penny into a can. Only they'll use the water glasses of people in the restaurant. Although Jeff wants to date Jules exclusively, she isn't certain. Then he goes up to the bar to get a drink, and the women are practically crawling all over him. That decided it right there.

On the good side, everybody approves of Jeff. Bobby appreciates his skills in Penny Can and Grayson thinks he's a good singer. He even tolerates Bobby's Beermosas on Brunch Saturday. (Yes, beer and orange juice, but Jules likes it.) But Grayson and Bobby seem to have issues with seeing Jules and Jeff together. Ellie, who now requires several Krispy Kreme doughnuts before Andy can have sex with her, demands to know why Grayson and Bobby are so mopey. Andy had kept their secret since Thanksgiving, but the stress became too much. He finally confesses to Ellie that the two of them are interested in Jules. And apparently, he didn't need to point out the incredibly obvious; the merely obvious will do.

Bobby and Grayson lament their lot in life at Grayson's bar. However, they'll have to deal with Laurie, whose new boyfriend, Smith, went back to law school, requiring her to go through her violent phase when a guy breaks up with her. Rather than having her assault defenseless bars, Grayson has her rechannel her energy into bartending. But apparently she decides to give the drinks for free and give herself to Smith's friend, Doug, for some revenge sex. Grayson and Bobby won't stand for it and they'll stop her from having sex at the Beach Club...by sending Travis. Bobby feels guilty, especially recalling that he left Jules in the lurch a few too many times. It is not something she takes well, especially if she was cooking all day like she decided to do for Jeff. When he finally arrives, she goes ballistic on him. He apologized for being 9 minutes late, and she realizes she's turning into ""crazy relationship person.""

As Travis retrieves Laurie, Jules and Jeff talk about what they want. Jules realizes she can't be a relationship person right now because she doesn't want to go through that process again so quickly after her divorce. She was hoping she and Jeff could go back to just having fun and enjoying themselves. The only problem was, Jeff has spent too much of his life that way and is tired of it. He wanted the relationship. Sadly, that didn't leave them much choice. She talks to Ellie about it, but Andy wants to clear out of the house first so he doesn't have to keep a new secret and get heartburn. He probably should have consulted with Grayson at the bar, who Laurie thanked for making her walk away from having revenge sex...by having sex with him. Andy's heartburn has returned."

LAURIE: You know, you're the only guy who actually gets less sexy when he's playing guitar.

Meanwhile, Jules is still in a funk over Jeff leaving, and even eats Fried Circles. (onion rings with the onions pulled out). Of course, Ellie is all too happy to help her stuff her face in standard breakup tradition. However, by the end of the night, everybody settles down. Laurie sleeps with Grayson again after a rainy night, rubbing a pine cone between her hands, and hearing REO Speedwagon makes her sentimental, Ellie has Sexy Night with Andy (which means no talking on his part), Travis is out in a tent with Kylie, and Jules heads to Bobby's boat for some pink wine, since she still has a little ""white trash"" left in her, and sleeps with Bobby.

Of course in the morning, the sun is up and you have to see who is next to you. Jules, surprisingly, had no issues sleeping with Bobby, not even the ""golf cart ride of shame"" back home deters her. (Barb, on the other hand...) Andy and Ellie did fine, Travis and Kylie enjoyed themselves until Travis ran like hell to get home. Laurie is having the ""worst morning ever."" She laments that she slept with Jules' ""someday guy"" twice, and she's afraid she ruined it for the two of them. Fortunately for Laurie, she'll have to wait until Jules is done with Bobby, who thinks he and Jules are getting back together. He even parks his boat in her driveway.

Jules is upset with Bobby but she was more upset with herself. Bobby still held a torch for her and she liked it. As much as she tried to deny it to Ellie, she couldn't just let sleeping with Bobby be about the one night and that was it.

JULES: God, how selfish of a person do you have to be to have sex with someone without even considering the consequences?

LAURIE: (panicked) It was raining! And REO Speedwagon rocks so hard!

Ellie assures Jules that he'll back off as long as she doesn't give any further signs of interest. In truth, everybody has issues to work on. Grayson and Laurie decide to not tell anybody...after bribing Andy to not blab. Travis comes clean about spending the night with Kylie, since she's upset he ran off on her in the morning. Cryptically, of course. Jules tells Travis to just tell ""the woman"" how he really feels, and Travis takes that advice. So does Bobby, who admits screwing everything up with Jules. Jules has to talk to Bobby and make sure they don't go down that path again and reconcile. Travis lets Kylie know how much she means to him. Laurie and Grayson...don't say much but share a few beers together. Ellie thanks Andy for letting her express her feelings, which apparently, Andy interprets as foreplay."

Ellie heads for her tennis lesson, mainly for the hot tennis instructor. She makes the mistake of showing Jules his photo, and now it's two lessons for the price of one. Besides, when playing tennis, Ellie grunts like a lumberjack (which was being kind) and Jules grunts in a very similar fashion to Meg Ryan in ""When Harry Met Sally."" Ellie is, to say the least, none too happy with Jules for swooping in on her crush. Jules is wondering why Ellie is calling dibs on the tennis instructor when she's already married. They go for another lesson, and the gloves come off. In the end, Alex asks Jules out to dinner, and Ellie leaves in a huff, taking Jules' car with her.

Laurie is apparently having issues letting go of Dale, her ex-, because she has a bevy of stuff still at his apartment...toothbrush, shampoo, Jessica Simpson hair extensions. Travis, who really doesn't need to know that his mom has the right to make fake sexual noises, advises her to just clean out her stuff at Dale's. However, she drags Travis with her, not to get back her stuff, but to steal some of Dale's things.

Andy goes to help Bobby again...to down some booze...and apologizes to Ellie for ditching her two nights in a row. And if Jules' night in the second episode to Beyonce's ""All the Single Ladies"" was crazy enough, then you can imagine when you take a camera with the guys and put on some Thin Lizzie. In the morning, Bobby is determined to have another night like that, but Grayson is starting to see a bad pattern. Bobby had done this six days in a row, and he doesn't want to see Bobby hit rock bottom and tells Andy this.

Ellie is upset with Jules for moving in on Alex, even though Jules found out the hard way that Alex lives in his van. Ellie decides that Jules is a bad friend for even thinking it's about Alex and walks out on her. Jules chases her throughout the neighborhood, even scaling walls and pushing Ellie into the pool of a neighbor. Ellie finally tells her that she's mad because Jules has been making everything about her since the divorce, and she wanted one ""Ellie day"" where she could talk about what was going on with her. She's upset that, for the first time in her life, Jules was being selfish.

Travis and Laurie are stuck in Dale's closet after trying to return his stuff. Apparently, having the third-largest collection of nunchucks in the area pretty much maps out your activities, forcing Travis and Laurie to stay in the closet while Dale works out. Laurie laments all of the bad decisions she has made in the past, but Travis points out that at least the decisions bother her now, which is actually progress.

Andy finally confronts Bobby about his partying, and Bobby finally admits that he was hurt by what happened with him and Jules. He stops his bender, and they get caricatures done of themselves down at the boardwalk. Jules apologizes to Ellie and makes an ""Ellie night"" to make up for lost time."

Waiting in line for 20 hours to win free chicken for a month might do it. But Bobby is in bigger trouble for letting him ditch school in the process. Must have been all that coleslaw. Jules insists they work together to raise Travis, and Ellie insists Andy act like he's older than 10. The Travis thing has a better shot. Andy can't let the inappropriate comments go, especially when Laurie gets the news that Smith is coming in for Valentine's Day and she will meet his father as well. (We'll skip the whole Internet photo thing of her feet dripping in honey.)

Travis asks if he can go to a party where alcohol will be served. Jules refuses, so Travis is forced to break out the photo album for his defense. (""Keep looking; you'll find out why she named your hamsters Jager and Meister."") Jules is convinced she doesn't have to drink or be out somewhere. But since Grayson doesn't have plans either, Jules insists they spend Valentine's Day together not doing anything. Other than stopping Ellie from being the Alpha Dog in their morning coffee klatch.

We see Andy's work place for once, and he is FAR less creepier at work, which makes him that much creepier everywhere else. He has a big client coming in, and Bobby is giving him pointers for relaxing and preparing for him. The client in question turns out to be Smith's father, who just happens to show up with Laurie right when they're having their meeting. Unfortunately, Smith's father does not approve of Laurie in any way. (""She looks like she should be on a mudflap."") Worse, Smith's father goads Andy into agreeing, who is trying to woo him to investing with him. Andy apologizes to Laurie, who wasn't even offended by it. Andy stands up to Smith's father, who immediately rips up their agreement.

Bobby isn't too happy about Jules banning Travis from going to a party without discussing it first, given that she yelled at him earlier for doing that very same thing. He tells her that Travis should be allowed to go, since he may do something worse like go behind her back and then try to drive home. Jules won't budge, so Bobby goes behind her back and asks Travis to call for a ride if he gets drunk at the party. Sure enough, Travis needs a golf cart right home. Bobby sets up some ""trash raccoons"" to create a diversion while Travis sneaks in the back, but Jules wasn't fooled. He gets grounded and Jules is ready to go ballistic on Bobby. Except that Jules and Bobby were in cahoots the whole time. Bobby rats Travis out every time he calls, and Travis thinks Bobby's got his back for picking him up when he's too drunk to drive.

Jules is still upset for spending Valentine's Day alone, but Grayson gives her a little pick-me-up by decorating Ellie's house from head to toe for Christmas after Ellie cuts out Grayson's bushes for leaving his Christmas lights up."

She wants to buy the condo Jules was showing to a 28-year-old who was about to buy it. Fortunately, the condo suddenly had new carpeting since the old carpeting was full of blood. (Jules was so proud of Laurie!) Unfortunately, Laurie purchases too many tuna melts and breath mints (""it's a vicious cycle"") to need someone to co-sign a loan. Perhaps she can get the money from Bobby, who just won $200 in his basketball pool...only to be robbed of it. By an unarmed woman. Grayson can't believe that a woman took his $200...that is the money Bobby owes him at the bar. Perhaps it was Barb, who hired Travis to run errands for her while she went into hiding after a horrible chemical peel. Or maybe it was the same woman going through Jules' stuff in her office. But before she can reenact the use of the pen from ""Grosse Pointe Blank,"" Laurie comes in and says hello to her mother.

Doing a full 180, Jules gushes over Laurie, which her mom automatically assumes means the two are lesbians. They deny it, although both of them call Portia and don't want to be Ellen. She also blabs that Laurie needs a co-signer for her new condo. Jules quickly excuses herself. Later, Laurie explains that her mother can't co-sign, since her job is professional ambulance chaser. The reverse seems to be happening: her mother wants her money. Jules puts the proverbial foot down, saying every family has that one crazy person in it...just as Bobby walks in. (to be fair, he actually waited for that line) Laurie asks Jules not to say anything to her mother, but Jules can't abide by Sheila (Laurie's mother) going out to a spa and getting some permanent eyeliner (which she enjoys having touched) on Laurie's dime. Sheila is naturally offended by Jules' words, thinking that Laurie now owes her for all the perms, candy cigarettes, and real cigarettes Laurie got as a kid. Laurie walks in to see Jules berating Shelia and is upset. Worst of all, we now now Jules' middle name is Kiki.

The next day, Laurie comes to the real estate office to apologize to Jules and wonder why Jules doesn't hate her. As it turns out, her mother is really mean, told her she couldn't do anything, and can punch people to make them puke, as Bobby found out the hard way. Jules wondered why Laurie couldn't stand up to her mother, but seeing her mother try to throw a rock through the office window because Jules was hugging Laurie may have done the trick. Laurie sends her mother packing, and her mother still doesn't get it. Jules co-signs Laurie's mortgage.

Bobby, who has taken crap from everybody regarding being beat up by a woman, is finally knocked off his pedestal of embarrassment. Apparently, Bobby CAN be embarrassed, despite his protestations to the contrary. On the good side, Ellie admits to being friends with Bobby when she has his back during the fight with Sheila."

(And if you guessed Laurie had the leopard-skinned pattern Snuggie, you'd be correct) Can men and women truly have a platonic relationship? (Gee, wouldn't that be a great plot for a movie?) Perhaps not, but Jules is convinced...and proves it...that all men are at least a little bit gay. (""Fuscia?"" ""Wind Beneath My Wings?"") Andy wants to break away from this cycle and buys Laurie's motorcycle to do it. Obviously, Ellie wouldn't approve of this, so he asks her while she's fighting off a sleeping pill. It turns out, Andy was taking Jules' advice on shaking up his routine so he didn't get in a rut. Perhaps he should have followed her suggestion of wearing sexy underwear. (Hey, if you could survive Ian Gomez boinking Mrs. Louder on The Drew Carey Show, how bad could this be?)

Jules, being Jules (or Monica), is determined that she is right and there can be a non-sexual relationship between a man and a woman. She starts calling all the guys she used to know to find one who didn't want to sleep with her. Wheelchair Bob was the best candidate, but apparently he's gotten the feeling back ""down there."" After a series of disasters, she confides in one of her neighbors, Tom. Probably the least-offensive person on the planet. (Seriously, even I have a better shot at Courteney Cox than this guy.) But suddenly Grayson's not having it. He thinks Tom is making the moves on a vulnerable Jules and threatens bodily harm.

Bobby and Travis go ""noodle fishing,"" AKA ""redneck fishing"", where your arm is the fishing pole...and also the bait, judging by the YouTube video that makes those hit baseballs to the groin seem so pleasant. Travis wants to know why he needs to find ""a good hole,"" and whether or not catfish are worth eating. (""Taste like butt."") But there was no stopping Bobby, who did manage to catch about a 40-pounder. Bobby is acting like the conservative blonde on ""The View"" who always gets into fights by not sharing some of his 40 pounds of catfish (that tastes like butt) with Travis. Eventually, Bobby backs down and tells Travis he doesn't have to do this. He was just trying to ""man him up"" a bit but suddenly realizes he doesn't want Travis to turn into a grown-up so quickly.

Andy and Ellie are in a full-blown argument about the motorcycle, but Jules insists on intervening since they're fighting in her presence. Ellie tells her to back off, even though the sight of people she cares about fighting makes her hyperventilate. Jules isn't stopping, claiming she had sex in their house. Andy walks out, gets on his motorcycle, drives it into Jules' bushes for the second time, and decides to stay on Andy's boat. This is news to Ellie, who was convinced she has had these arguments with him so many times and knew what he was going to do next.

Jules is now panicking because she feels responsible for Andy leaving. She promises not to tell anybody, but everybody heard it anyway.

LAURIE: I remember when my dad walked out my mom for the first time, she was crushed. Then a month later, when she realized he had taken me and my sister with him, it got even worse. But then she found us in Cabo, and it was the best vacation ever!

Jules goes to get Andy and Grayson volunteers to go with her, if only to keep Tom from doing it. They convince Andy to go to his son's recital, once he puts on some clothes underneath his Snuggie. (They don't use the actual word ""snuggie,"" but I can't remember what word they used and then I'd have to explain it.) Unfortunately, Jules' idea of driving him there on his motorcycle only scared him to death. She returns home and says goodbye to Tom, who hugs her and puts his hand on her @$$. Actually, he bypasses her jeans and panties and does the direct approach. (And yet I can't get a date?)

It turns out Ellie and Andy were on their way to making up, in spite of Jules' assistance. Ellie insists that Jules hasn't been in a healthy marriage, which she admits.

ELLIE: When a marriage works, the tiny bumps in the road don't really matter. You don't have to be scared because there's never really any jeopardy.

Ellie and Andy compromise: Andy got to ride the motorcycle for ten minutes a day under supervision."

Grayson (Josh Hopkins) and Bobby (Brian Van Holt) remind her that Oprah says people who talk on their cell phones while driving is crazy dangerous. (""Does Oprah say anything about how lame-ass it is for grown men to watch her show. But Jules has a job as a real estate agent, and she's not afraid of Oprah. (gasp!)

While Travis is introduced to Bobby's dog, Travis (""I name all the things I love Travis"") and watches in horror as Travis (the dog) bites Bobby's ""little Travis"" (and that's all you need to know), Laurie gets on the phone to berate Jules about talking on her cell phone in her car...by calling Jules on her cell phone in her car. But Jules is safe: she's knee-driving while applying lipstick. In fact, she has to get right to the Peterson's house to talk to them. So she gets there quickly...through the fence...and into their pool.

At the bar, Grayson is dealing with a salesperson, Sara (Sheryl Crow), who wants to sell him a case of wine called Hurpes. (""It's French; it's pronounced er-PAY."") However, Ellie (Christa Miller) warns Sara about Grayson being the type who's house is more like a clown car for barely-legal bimbos. Sara leaves a card and tells him to call when he feels like having a date with two 20-year-olds at the same time. Jules is very shaken up from her accident and reviews with Ellie and Laurie their roles at the funeral. She also asks Travis to promise he won't be able to go on with life when she dies.

TRAVIS: How about I grieve for a few months but then I look for you in every girl I date?

JULES: Deal!

ELLIE: You know, when most people have a near-death experience, they re-examine their OWN lives.

Apparently, Jules doesn't want to do that because she doesn't have any vices...as she downs wine out of a squeeze bottle. She decides to stop drinking wine for a month just to prove she can change. However, it would seem the entire gang has wine issues. They can't have a good time without it. (So wine replaces coffees and lattes in this show? Interesting...)

Grayson doesn't even get to his seat at dinner with Sara before she asks him what happened in his previous marriage. Sara also asks him about his parents and whether he thinks he'll get married again. Grayson doesn't want anything to do with those questions, and Sara isn't happy. He tries some of the questions he normally asks the twentysomethings. The date is going downhill fast, but at least we know Sara's favorite number is 3. (Well, it's a magic number...)

Andy gets jealous on the Jealous Much? (Bobby's boat) when he sees everything that Bobby is doing for Travis (the dog), even making a homemade elevator for him. Naturally, Travis (the dog) doesn't like Andy, and the feeling is mutual. Grayson laments to Jules and Ellie (who is drinking Hurpes) about the questions Sara asked him. You know, the sort of questions grown-ups ask on a date. Jules asks him if those twentysomethings he thinks are more fun are still fun after they've had sex. Turns out, they're not. It also turns out that Jules has a lot more energy without wine. And since this is a sitcom, she also annoys the living crap out of everybody. Calling Bobby at 6 in the morning, telling Ellie every detail of her dreams, and learning Mandarin in front of Laurie. She finally figures it out.

It's intervention time for Jules. (""Mom, you need to start drinking."" ""There is nothing that won't make me stop loving you. Except you not drinking."") Jules, naturally is upset, but especially at Ellie and Laurie because she always backs them when they do crazy things. Like Bobby making Andy walk Travis (the dog) in the middle of the night so the two will get along. Ellie and Laurie come to apologize, but they notice Jules not exactly talking normally. Perhaps because her tongue and lips are now purple?

Grayson comes to his senses with younger women, but he doesn't want to date older women since they mess with your heads.

GRAYSON: It's like, they know exactly what to say to freak you out.

SARA: COMMITMENT! (worked, didn't it?)

Of course now Bobby and Sara have to double-team Grayson on the things he did wrong on their date, like calling the waiter ""bro."" (""That is weak, dude. Wait, dude is still OK, right?"") Sara is tired of waiting for Grayson to become interesting and leaves. Finally, he's had enough and runs after her in the parking lot. He ws upset because she was peppering him with questions before he could even have a piece of bread and didn't want to talk about his ex because she had hurt him so badly. He comes clean and even calls her annoying. They start making out. Which is better than Travis (the dog) winning the battle over Andy by sitting on him.

Jules gives in and has wine. She hates the fact that she can't change.

JULES: You know what sucks about getting older? You still have the same dreams and that things will be different in a year, ten years, whatever. But deep down, you know those dreams aren't going to come true. You know, I just get out of bed everyday and say, 'Oh, this is it.' You know? I am who I am. And then I'll die.

But it turns out Jules can change. At least she pulls over now before talking on a cell phone."

Jules' new bathroom gets rave reviews.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Michael McDonald'],"['', '', '']",[],"['hugging', 'embarrassment', 'dog', 'bathrobe']",[],"Jules (Courteney Cox) is getting a new bathroom, larger than the previous one. Coincidentally, Travis' (Dan Byrd) bedroom is now a bit smaller. Grayson (Josh Hopkins) can't think of a new song, Laurie (Busy Philipps) informs Andy (Ian Gomez) about a ""great shirt alert"" (not really, it's just fun to say), and Ellie (Christa Miller) is ticked that they're hanging out at Jules' house with all the noise. Although Gerald, the person installing the tile, appreciates all the advice the gang has given him. (must have issues delivering those Miller High Life cases and taking them from people) But Jules is proud of her new bathroom; so much show she's having a bathroom-warming party. It's BYOL (bring your own Lysol).

While ""posing"" for Travis' photo club pictures they talk about Grayson being in a relationship with Sara (Sheryl Crow). Jules doesn't know how to react, since she really hasn't shown an interest in Grayson. But she is a little depressed about it. (And thinks she takes great pictures when she's depressed.) However, talking to Sara in a coffee shop seems to have lightened the mood.

The bathroom-warming party is going well. The bathroom does look great, and it even has one of those electronic Japanese toilets...that yells at Jules in Japanese from time to time. (wasn't explained, and I didn't ask for details) Unfortunately, the party is about to be ruined by Grayson and Sara. Everybody figures Grayson is going to be all cocky and full of himself.

GRAYSON: Yeah, my little Sare-Bear's tummy was growling, so we got a wittle num-num for her. A wittle num-num! (he even holds Sara's purse for her)

They leave right away because the ""ol' ball and chain"" (he was kidding) had to go. But Jules, Ellie, and Laurie are convinced that Grayson is ""pursey-whipped."" (Their phrase, not mine, thank God.) Jules confronts him about it...in her bathroom...which she hasn't left in two days. She shows him some of the evidence from Travis' camera (which thankfully is no longer taking pictures of everything, including Ellie naked), such as feeding Sarah ice cream and painting her toenails. She tells Grayson not to smother Sara or Sara will start pulling away. Grayson writes it off to Jules being jealous. Jules consults Laurie and Ellie on this...in her bathroom...and they agree with Grayson that Jules meddles too much. Jules channels her inner Monica to say that she won't ever do that again, which elicits laughs from both of them, and Travis, and Travis' girlfriend Kylie.

Andy is having problems with Ellie because they haven't had sex in a while. He follows Bobby's (Brian Van Holt) advice to act cool about it and not let her think he's dying to have sex. It works, until Ellie drops her robe. Andy goes back to Bobby for more advice, because that never goes wrong. Bobby says his only recourse now is to get all the sexual desire out of his system so he doesn't go crazy for Ellie. He's gotta make a few ""shower babies."" (I BEG you not to ask me what that means.)

Travis is having problems with Kylie, beyond the two of them heading to different colleges. Ellie nails it on the head when Travis wants to use Ellie's naked picture for his collection and never took any naked ones of her. He was hesitant to think of Kylie in the same way he photographed Ellie. (LAURIE: There is nothing less sexy than a man who respects a restraining order.) Travis relents and asks Kylie to use her picture instead. Jules talks to the only person still talking to her: Gerald. (yes, in her bathroom) He appreciated the advice the gang gave him before, but Jules confesses she's out of the advice-giving business because she feels she was wrong about Grayson being too clingy to Sarah. Actually, she wasn't. Sara is getting tired of Grayson's smothering. But Gerald tells her she has a gift for buttin' in. He appreciated being invited over after the bathroom was completed. Although Jules just needed a few of the tiles straightened. She apologizes to Grayson and asks him to bring back the edgy, aloof guy. Truthfully, women want an ""everything man"", who is secure but will also be jealous, who will listen but will also tell women to pipe down. Sure enough, it works, and Grayson has a new song, which he does in a duet with sara (like Sheryl Crow wouldn't sing at least once in her appearances). Jules, however, is not sure if she's happy that she fixed Grayson's relationship."

Whoever cries between Bobby (Brian Van Holt) and Andy (Ian Gomez) first to Cats in the Cradle by Harry Chapin loses. Jules (Courteney Cox) just knows she has Andy by the throat, since she tells him Stan doesn't even cry anymore when he leaves the house. Ellie (Christa Miller) can't compete with that and breaking down Bobby. Put one in the win column for Jules. And as if she didn't have enough victories today, Travis (Dan Byrd) just got dumped by Kylie, which means she gets to put him back together. She is so happy, she even tried to preserve the tear Travis left on her sweater. Actually, she's been tasting it the whole day. Even Ellie thought that was creepy, although not as creepy as Grayson (Josh Hopkins) coming in with Sara (Sheryl Crow)...and Ellie and Jules keep gushing over her.

Andy is freaking out over Stan not looking anything like him. Not even Bobby putting Stan's pacifier in Andy's mouth was any help. But Laurie (Busy Philipps) admits that not all babies have to look like their parents.

LAURIE: I looked like my biological dad's handsome brother...until my mom got pregnant with me and my dad made him move out.

Laurie suggests something other than Andy and Stan dressing up in the same outfits, like a petting zoo. Other than the goat wrangler doing upsie-daisies with Stan without asking first, things seem to go OK, Andy hopes Stan likes the geese that are there, and Laurie is ready to record the evidence. The goose who bites Andy might make a good YouTube video. There are even t-shirts.

Grayson comes over and tries to cheer Travis up...and ticks off Jules in the process. Although he didn't mind being spanked by Jules' spatula. But she's not done being crazy just yet. She spots Kylie in a coffee shop and is ready to give Kylie a piece of her mind. Laurie tries to talk her out of it. (""As my uncle/dad once said 'check yourself before you wreck yourself'."") But Jules...being Jules (or psycho Monica, since let's face it, it's Courteney's wheelhouse)...decides to be Mama Bear at Kylie. But Kylie tells Jules that Travis cheated on her. The claws are immediately retracted.

Jules tries to get Bobby to talk to Travis about cheating, saying that Bobby made such a mistake with all of his cheating. However, Bobby only ever cheated on Jules, and suddenly the argument is no longer about Travis. And it apparently involved Travis' speech therapist, which Travis didn't even know he had. Jules was not happy because she thought he cheated on everybody, not just her. Now she has to ask Jeff (Scott Foley) about it. He didn't cheat on her...once they were exclusive. This is worse than when Jules caught Billy Miller eating another girl's paste in kindergarten. (""That's not a metaphor. And gross!"") Jules is depressed and sits in her tub. Grayson, being dragged through this and sympathetic enough to let Jules eat two dozen mozzarella sticks at his bar, tries to comfort her. Sara finds out and considers the situation very awkward.

It turns out Ellie had been talking to Sara...even cheating on Jules by having wine with her during the day...and told Sara that there may be more to Jules/Grayson than meets the eye. While Grayson assures Sara that he hasn't and doesn't intend to sleep with Jules, Jules decides to not let Kylie take back Travis and encourages her to move on. Travis finds her.

TRAVIS: JULES KIKI COBB!! What the hell are you doing???

Travis admits to kissing Tina Spangler...and Kylie kissed Joey Spangler after the H1N1 Assembly last week. (""So, you're both sluts!"") Their problem is solved, and Jules' continues. She is upset with herself for always forgiving those who cheat on her. She explains her situation to Grayson and he lends an ear...even keeping the bar open past 8 and blowing off his date with Sara. Sara doesn't take well to it and leaves him.

Andy and Laurie go to Ellie, who has been accusing him of cheating lately since the goose hickey and the fact he didn't tell her he went to the petting zoo with Laurie. Andy comes clean and tells the entire truth. He was depressed (although Bobby had margaritas on standby) that he had nothing in common with Stan. However, Ellie knew of one thing Andy and Stan had in common. And it's a bit tough to say it on a family board, so just take a guess.

Jules sees Grayson outside as Sara leaves. She wants to feel bad for him, but both give long looks to the other, and there could be more to it than that. They don't even allow Ellie to watch."

LAURIE: (very offended) I am allergic to latex and birth control pills!

SMITH: Not helping, babe.

Andy is out on the curb because he tried the old I'm-a-man-and-can-do-what-I-want routine, and Grayson (Josh Hopkins) and creepy Tom have to gloat over the fact that they're not attached and can do what they want, like wear black denim jeans and listen to Enya and walk around with a cowboy hat and underwear. (Why did I even put that in the synopsis?)

As Travis watches Jules, Bobby, and Ellie drink wine on a Saturday morning (it's European), he waits for replies from the two other colleges he applied to. Fortunately, both of them accepted him. (And if I never see the dance that Courteney Cox, Dan Byrd, and Brian Van Holt did ever again, I'll be happy.) One of the colleges is 20 minutes away in Sarasota, and the other college is in California. Naturally, Jules doesn't want him to go to the school where they have earthquakes, race riots, and people who stick their heads out of their cars and shoot you in the face. But it's Travis' decision!

As Andy continues to enjoy dancing to Enya at 1 in the morning in his underwear and cowboy hat. (and now joined by Bobby, Grayson, and Jules), Laurie is contemplating breaking up with Smith. Jules tells her that her relationship with Smith is without drama and she should appreciate that, even though the drama makes Laurie's ""lady parts beep.""

JULES: Would you rather be with someone emotionally stable or someone who, on Game Night, carves 'die, bitch' on the kitchen table because he sucks at Jenga?

LAURIE: There are positives and negatives to both. And I'm really sorry for carving that on your table.

Laurie is convinced to give it another try, but Smith already knows something is off. As Smith's dad is firing Bobby as his golf coach...until he sees Travis (the dog) retrieve his golf ball...Smith admits the best date with Laurie involved sex at a convenience store...while it was being robbed. They continue talking while Smith's dad does his Bishop Pickering imitation (that's from Caddyshack, gotta give the show credit for the 'rat farts!'), and they see one of the guys Laurie slept with while he was at law school. Laurie didn't want Smith to confront ""wallet chain guy"" earlier, but Smith does and ends up with blood on his lip and Laurie on him. But she is upset because she's trying for drama-free and he created drama to get into bed with her. But she realizes the drama only works for a while before it gets real. He agrees to be a stable guy for her...and brings her to his disapproving dad anytime she needs a drama fix.

Andy got kicked out of the house for the late night parties in his underwear to Enya...which graduated to grilled steaks and water rings on the table made of wine. But Ellie is in a partially-good mood, since Bobby out-parented her.

Apparently, Jules watches Travis sleep. Some nights, Ellie and Laurie join her. He figures this out, but she admits that he was the only thing she had that kept her from being totally alone following the divorce. He gives in and tells her that all of the emotional blackmail worked. He'll go to college in Florida. She feels like hell and apologizes, but he had decided to go to the school in Florida the whole time. They go and visit the campus. She's great, until he asks to stay at a friend's place on the campus.

TRAVIS: I've just gotten here and I already don't want to go home!

Jules promises she's OK to drive home alone...which means she cries the whole way. She asks Grayson why she didn't tell him. He apologies (even though he did before). He brings her into the house and she bends his ear about Travis leaving. She kisses him, and he takes her upstairs."

But they're even more excited about reading an online study which suggest middle-aged women can stay skinny by drinking moderate amounts of alcohol. They're practically giddy, since they read it on the Internet...

EVERYBODY: IT MUST BE TRUE!!

Travis (Dan Byrd) greets the ""booze bags,"" and everybody is excited about his graduation. Jules and Bobby even go down to get graduation tickets. (There's an actual office for this. We didn't have one of those in high school. Hell, I had to go to work the day of my graduation. What kind of fantasy crap is this?!?!?!?) Laurie apolgizes that she has to be in the Bahamas with Smith, but she has that lifelong fantasy of going to countries with handsome black men wandering around, and she just can't pass it up.

Andy (Ian Gomez) asks Travis about a speech one of the students gives at graduation: the everyman speech. Travis didn't even submit his name because he doesn't think graduating high school is a big deal. Not the right thing to say in front of your mom if you're an only child. (If you have 7 kids and you're the 7th to do it, you're lucky if anybody even shows up.) Everyone is shocked, because Bobby peaked at graduation...and was proud of it. Andy was bald by 16, so he bought the beer for everyone. (Important job, best way to get women if you're ugly.) But Travis doesn't want anybody (re: Jules) to make a big deal about it. That's just throwing down the gauntlet at Jules. And she wants Bobby (Brian Van Holt), Andy, and Grayson involved in it.

It turns out Travis was just blowing hot air and was depressed about not making any sort of mark in high school. The best he could do was a goofy picture of him trying to push the creepy woodshop teacher into the band saw, which got Photoshopped out anyway. He admits it to Jules and she tries to play off high school as not being significant for her. Then he whips out her yearbook from 1988 (cough-BULLCRAP-cough), where she is all over the place, including dancing onstage with Bruce Springsteen. (Gee, did they have to Photoshop that picture?) And Courteney actually demonstrates the dance she did onstage with Bruce Springsteen.

40 pictures of his mom in her yearbook later, Travis is even more depressed. Jules has an idea: write the ""everyman"" speech. He does the ""disappointed"" fake-out before telling her they picked his speech. Jules wants to go down to the mall to get a t-shirt with Travis' picture on it, because she wants to ""wear the moment."" She should get a new hat for Ellie on the way, since Laurie went psycho and cut up Ellie's hat after being insulted by Ellie for the last time.

Travis thanks Jules for everything she did, despite wearing that sweatshirt with her picture and his covered by his hands. He departs, not even realizing he was sitting on Grayson's face (there was a blanket between them, thankfully). Grayson wants to continue where they left off, but Jules stole Travis' speech, ony to discover she isn't mentioned, but Bobby is.

Grayson is wondering if anyone is having a worse morning than him. Yeah, a hot brunette in lingerie is straddling you and asking you to get coffee. Life sucks, doesn't it? Of course, Jules is going ballistic that Bobby gets an entire story about chasing that red balloon with the $2,000 in it and she doesn't get a mention. But Laurie might be able to top it, since Ellie wants to tear the classy dress that she bought that Ellie insulted and started the whole fight in the first place. However, Laurie is so upset, she doesn't even care that Ellie broke in through the window and wants to shred it, which is no fun for Ellie. It turns out Laurie was upset at Jules because she wouldn't excuse Ellie from missing Travis' graduation, but Laurie was OK to miss it. The dress was actually for the graduation, not Smith. She made up the whole vacation. Laurie is scared that Jules doesn't regard her as such as close friend, but Ellie tells her she's crazy. If Jules could only save one of them from a fire, Ellie couldn't honestly say which one it would be. Laurie thinks that is sweet and replaces Ellie's hat.

Bobby found the perfect way to embarrass Travis about graduation: an inflatable gorilla with Travis' face on it. Travis wants to go one day without being embarrassed, but Jules is reminding him about the house she put over his head, helping him learn how to read, and every other major event that took place in his life that she helped him with.

At the graduation (or fantasy draft camp, as Barb calls it), Travis tells Jules that he is mentioning Bobby because Bobby has self-esteem issues about peaking in high school, and Travis tells her how much he loves her and appreciates all she did for him. She is touched, and Bobby won't hear the speech anyway, since he went to chase the red balloon with the $2,000 in it. But Travis saw the balloon too.

TRAVIS' SPEECH: ""I love you, Dad! Thank you, everybody!""

And everybody goes to chase the balloon, except Ellie and Grayson. He thinks they're silly, but he thanks Ellie for letting him wear her big hat.

But now Andy knows about Jules and Grayson, since it grosses him out to see it, and they need him to go get takeout."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1643007/?ref_=ttep_ep24,,Jules and Grayson must figure out a way to tell Bobby they're a couple. Travis misses an important anniversary with Kylie.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Michael McDonald'],"['', '', '']",[],"['kiss', 'punishment', 'scolding', 'hugging', 'bed', 'beach', 'bare chested male', 'reference to bruce willis']",[],"Jules (Courteney Cox) has to figure out a way to tell everybody else that she and Grayson (Josh Hopkins) are dating. Ellie (Christa Miller) walks in and blabs it out works rather nicely. However, Laurie (Busy Philipps) insists there's a nine-day rule before it's officially a relationship (""like hair extensions and foster parents""). Travis (Dan Byrd) promises not to call Grayson ""new Dad"" for $20. (winner) Travis goes to have a romantic picnic with Kylie...and Bobby (Brian Van Holt). Only problem is, Travis forgot it was their seven-month anniversary. And Kylie ate the last piece of fancy salami. (""I wish I could be your mouth.""---Bobby)

Back in slightly more insane pastures (emphasis on slightly), Jules doesn't want to sleep at Grayson's, as she doesn't want to boldly go where so many women have gone before. She's afraid of a balloon drop for being the millionth customer. Grayson, shockingly, is taking the high road and asks her if she told Bobby they were dating. Nope. Suddenly Andy, Travis, Laurie, and Ellie all remember this little tidbit as well. A strategy session decides that Jules or Grayson or Andy (Ian Gomez) has to tell him about it. A game of Ultimate Penny Can will decide the ""winner."" A correct Bobby question gets you one step closer to the can, and Andy seems to have the advantage as Bobby's best friend. (and Ellie asking the questions) Jules gets to the can next...and manages to miss an easy drop. Grayson nails it from across the street, so Jules has to tell Bobby. Naturally, Jules won't put up with this and uses Grayson's ""in a relationship, you have to do things you don't want to do"" line against him. (Ellie even made a club mix version of it)

Laurie advises Travis to apologize to Kylie for missing the anniversary, no matter how stupid he thinks it sounds. Before he knows it, Kylie will pull off that sweet, innocent mask and break out the ferocious devil-face look, which she demonstrates. Travis doesn't take the advice, with the forseeable results. Laurie tells him he needs to play defense when a woman is mad at him. In Smith's case, he takes Laurie shopping. For Andy, he pretends to sleep. After much planning, Travis tries out his defense on Laurie and Ellie. He agrees with anything they say. They agree he's the perfect ""yes man.""

Jules and Grayson make it to Bobby's boat and cut off all of Bobby's means of escape. It seems that Bobby runs when he's confronted with bad news. Jules had to chase him with a stolen ATV to serve him divorce papers. It certainly didn't help that Bobby was upset about being a third wheel these days. With Kylie and Travis, with Laurie and Smith, even his dog ignores him now for his new girlfriend.

BOBBY: I gotta tell you, we're the last three standing. I hate to be Daddy Downer, but If I was the only one single, I don't know what I'd do.

Sure enough, Jules and Travis chicken out. Jules wants to know why Grayson didn't help, and Grayson wants to know why she needs a plan to do it. And Grayson's defense is the ""computer shutdown and reboot."" On the plus side, Bobby and Andy are having good ""bro's before ho's"" conversation in Andy's bedroom (with Ellie present), but Grayson comes in (still with Ellie present). He sees how Bobby is miserable not being able to hang out with everybody (even though he is), so he goes back to Jules with a plan. Everybody is going to the beach as singles and hanging out togther. Couples can't even drive together. At least Barb likes the plan.

The time at the beach is great. Bobby gets to be buried in the sand, Kylie forgives her ""yes man,"" and everybody enjoys themselves. And since Bobby is buried in the sand, he can't run away when they tell him. Jules congratulates Grayson on a great plan and kisses him.

BOBBY: What the hell?!?!?!

JULES: That wasn't smart.

Bobby thinks everybody thinks he's a joke, but Jules convinces him the whole beach plan was because they were worried about him. Bobby is upset, but as long as Jules and Grayson promise to take care of each other, he'll get over it."

She writes them in hopes of recapturing their former relationship. This episode appears to be a flashback to the history of the women's relationship.

We start with Vanessa and Mina as girls. They are close friends and neighbors, with their respective family estates located next to one another. The two families are exceptionally close.

We see Vanessa spending time with Mina's brother Peter. Vanessa seems far more comfortable around the ubiquitous animals in the home of an African explorer. It sounds as if Peter and Vanessa are expected to be married one day.

Malcolm returns from a trip and it seems his marriage is a passionless one. He also seems far more excited to see Mina and Vanessa than he is Peter. That night Vanessa catches Malcolm having an affair with her mother, but she never told Mina.

The next day Vanessa begins what she calls ""little acts of mischief,"" stealing small items like combs. She says she realized there was something more to it.

When they are older Mina is the first of the pair to find a mate, an officer named Charles Branson. Vanessa is jealous of Mina's relationship and is upset the couple may end up in India.

Vanessa and Peter take a private walk and he confesses feeling like Malcolm considers him a disappointment. His plan is to join his father in Africa. Vanessa makes a pass at Peter but he awkwardly stops her and rushes away.

That night Vanessa prays to God but seems to get a response from a more sinister source.

We forward to Mina and Charles' wedding weekend. The night before the wedding Vanessa takes Charles to the animal room. The two begin to flirt and Vanessa comes on to Charles. The two begin to have sex and Mina walks into the room and witnesses the betrayal.

The next day Charles leaves town in disgrace. Vanessa lashes out at her mother and makes reference to knowing of her affair with Malcolm. Malcolm won't let Vanessa see Mina. He closes a door between their homes which had always remained open. On her way back home Vanessa collapses.

Vanessa falls ill with an inexplicable illness. Her mother sits by her bedside and it sounds as if Malcolm has cut off ties with her as well. The plan is to consult a specialist in London. Vanessa asks her mother to let her die.

The specialist, a Dr. Banning, tells Vanessa's parents he has a plan to treat her catatonia and ""psycho-sexual behavior."" If that doesn't work there are surgical options. Vanessa begins talking. When she and the doctor are alone she attacks Banning and begins speaking in a strange tongue.

Eventually Vanessa undergoes what looks like a lobotomy-type procedure. A drill is placed at the side of her head and Banning turns it into her brain.

We cut to Peter visiting Vanessa's home. He's there to say good-bye before leaving for Africa with his father. Her mother brings her to Vanessa's room. Peter sits at the bedside of Vanessa, who is not doing well. He leans in close and Vanessa whispers ""you're going to die there.""

Vanessa receives a visit from a devil-type spirit taking the form of Malcolm. It recites lines from Keats and kisses her passionately. Vanessa's mother hears a noise and goes to her daughter's room. She is nude, seemingly having sex with an invisible person.

Her mother dies and Vanessa attends the funeral. Later she encounters Mina on the beach. Mina says she thinks Vanessa's sin has been forgiven through her suffering. Mina's married to a lawyer. Mina then makes reference to knowing things from Vanessa's thoughts. Her face turns dark and she refers to having been taught things by ""master."" She recovers briefly and asks Vanessa to ""save me from him, please."" She is then whisked way form Vanessa by some invisible force.

Vanessa then goes to see Malcolm. She says Mina needs their help and relays to him all that she knows about the situation. Malcolm says there was a point he wanted to kill her, but is willing to use her to find his daughter. But he has no plans to forgive her. They come to a temporary pact to join forces for Mina's sake.

Back in the present Vanessa tearfully finishes her letter. She believes the only purpose to her life is to find Mina. She addresses the letter to Jonathan Harker, Mina's husband, and places in a drawer with hundreds of others. Vanessa adds a P.S. that while Malcolm will do anything to save her, she loves Mina enough to kill her."

He asks if she sensed anything and is upset she's not doing enough to get back Mina.

Ethan returns home from his night with Gray to find Brona lying in bed, coughing blood into her pillow. He lies down next to her and she apologizes for her behavior at the theater. He tells her he loves her.

Vanessa tries to get some information using her cards. She hears a voice that sounds like Mina whisper ""Help me."" She then hears the screams of dozens of men. Vanessa walks to Malcolm's room and tells him the cards suggested a ship and something terrible happening. Gray stops by to apologize for leaving the theater and asks her if she'd like to have an adventure with him.

We see Victor examining Fenton's body.

The lead actress stops the theater's basement to have The Creature fix the blood tube she uses on stage. She is kind to him and tells him a story about her brother, who was in an accident and became shy as a result.

Victor tells Malcolm Fenton's autopsy didn't reveal anything unusual. They assume his ability to signal his master was similar to how bats communicate. After Victor leaves Sembene asks Malcolm if he's prepared for the possibility Mina is beyond help.

Gray arranged for Vanessa to be photographed. Gray talks about his preference for paintings over photography and references eternity.

The Creature leaves a book for the actress at her home. She knows it is from him and she smiles. He watches through a window as her significant other returns home and they kiss. We see The Creature weep.

Gray walks Vanessa home. They agree to have dinner that night.

Victor watches a ballet company practice, seemingly looking for potential brides for The Creature. Van Helsing arrives and the two go to dinner. Van Helsing advises him not to be controlled by his work. Victor talks about fate and retribution. Van Helsing wants to know Victor's story. He responds with, ""One day.""

Before leaving for dinner Vanessa stops to show Malcolm her dress. He's complimentary, but as soon as she leaves we see Malcolm and Sembene head out the door.

Ethan gets his gun and heads out for work. Brona advises him to keep a safe distance from her and he promptly gives her a kiss. She gives him her necklace, dedicated to the patron saint of lost causes, to wear.

Malcolm and Sembene meet with Ethan. Malcolm tells him they're going to ""explore a plague ship.""

Van Helsing tells Victor that Malcolm doesn't fully know what Malcolm is looking for. He say what he is about to tell him can never be told to Malcolm. Van Helsing says he killed his wife by driving a stake through her heart and cutting off her head.

Ethan tells Malcolm he's concerned for Brona. Malcolm offers to pay for a private institution but Ethan declines. They walk towards a ship that is in quarantine. He suspects ""chicanery.""

Gray tells Vanessa some of his life story, including religion and personal philosophies. They begin to talk about being unique and the desire not to be alone.

Van Helsing asks Victor if he's heard of vampires. He has not. He gives him a book on the subject which is essentially correct. Van Helsing talks about a creature that feeds on the living and its impact on those on which it feeds.

Vanessa looks at Gray's collection of portraits. She talks about there being ""things within us all that can never be unleashed."" He kisses her neck.

Van Helsing tells Victor vampires move in a pack like wolves and never stay in the same location for very long.

Malcolm, Ethan and Sembene board the dark ship. They encounter unconscious women with sharp nails. None of them is Mina. We see that the vampire is in the ship's hull beneath them. His eyes are also closed.

Van Helsing tells Victor he told him this information because he wants him to have a long life. He thinks Victor is capable of great things. At this moment The Creature arrives, grabs Van Helsing, pulls him down an alley and snaps his neck. The Creature tells Victor this will continue until he makes him a bride.

Vanessa and Gray head upstairs to his bedroom.

Malcolm does not find Mina among the women on the ship. We see the vampire's eyes open, and this snaps the women to life. They begin attacking the three men, who ultimately kill all of them. One of their lamps is knocked over during the battle.

Vanessa and Gray make love. It includes scratches and her cutting his chest and licking his blood.

The vampire comes to the top level of the ship and looks at Malcolm from across what has become a huge fire. He shows him that he has Mina. Malcolm is unable to reach them.

While in the throes of passion Vanessa hears a dark voice. It says: ""Hello, my child. I've been waiting. What games we will have now."" She immediately gathers her things and leaves.

Ethan lectures Malcolm on having more faith in the people he trusts, making a point to mention Vanessa.

We see Gray visit his secret painting. As he looks at it the wounds on his body are instantly healed.

Vanessa arrives home. Malcolm is waiting for her and is begins to open up to her about what is going on. She doesn't look herself and proceeds to throw her head back in the air and begin hovering about a foot off the ground."

Victor is brought to see Vanessa. He examines her and she says she doesn't remember what happened earlier when the room was destroyed. Vanessa is somehow is able to repeat past conversations Victor has had.

Victor tells Malcolm that Vanessa is having a psycho-sexual reaction. He thinks feelings of guilt have caused a psychological break. While he speaks the room begins to be filled with thousands of spiders. Vanessa screams from upstairs.

Malcolm calls Ethan to assist him with Vanessa. He's brought to her room where she is on the floor, growling. Ethan asks if he can help her and she says she's trying to fight the ""thing inside me."" She then asks about Ethan's sexual encounter with Gray. Vanessa begins speaking in Arabic, saying ""Let me die.""

Downstairs Malcolm tells Ethan that Vanessa has been possessed by ""the devil"" or ""a devil."" Ethan suggests a priest but the idea is dismissed. Malcolm wants them to help keep her alive while she fights the possession. Malcolm tells Ethan.

We're shown snapshots of a full week of possession.

Vanessa temporarily ""wakes up"" from the possession and asks Ethan for some water. She talks about what it's been like for her. She remembers some things and thanks Ethan for being kind to her. She asks him not to let her hurt anybody. Vanessa asks him to end her pain ""when the time comes."" His eyes blacken and he begins talking to her as the devil. He tells her ""I want you to be the mother of evil."" He wants her to help him ""topple God."" They embrace.

Malcolm and Ethan argue over the former planning another trip to Africa. He says he's going back to get Peter's body.

Malcolm sees that Victor is nursing a morphine addiction.

Victor suggests to Ethan that they may have to ""let her go."" Ethan tells him he's not sure why Malcolm wants to keep Vanessa alive. He tells Victor about native children being taken from their tribes, the result of which is their not belonging in either world and being forced to ""roam."" He says Vanessa is like them. With The Creature still waiting for him outside, Victor asks Ethan to teach him how to shoot.

More time passes. Vanessa must be restrained to keep from hurting herself.

Ethan and Sembene share some of their personal history. Ethan's theory is that Malcolm saved Sembene's life and he now owes him. Sembene thinks Ethan should call a priest.

Up in her room Malcolm attempts to speak directly to Vanessa. He asks her to find Mina. Vanessa suggests that this is what Malcolm wanted all along. Ethan comes into the room and puts a stop to the proceedings. In the hallway Ethan tells Malcolm they must get Vanessa a priest. They are finally able to convince him. Ethan promises that if Vanessa was right about Malcolm's intentions with Vanessa, ""I'll rip your throat out.""

Victor gives Malcolm a cocaine derivative to help him stay awake. Malcolm tells him more of the particulars of Peter's death, finishing with ""I haven't a shred of decency left.""

Ethan brings a priest named Father Matthews. Matthews says the ritual of exorcism is forbidden without permission from Rome. He promises only to give her Last Rights.

Matthews is brought to see Vanessa and is shocked by what he encounters. He begins the ritual, but after a few moments Vanessa is able to free herself and bit a huge chunk out of Matthews' face. Ethan and Vanessa end up alone in the room. Speaking in Vanessa's voice she begs Ethan to kill her. He places his gun to her chest, but instead of pulling the trigger he places Brona's necklace on her forehead and begins chanting in Latin. It works and we hear the demon leave Vanessa's body. Without saying a word Ethan grabs his coat and leaves.

The next day Vanessa goes downstairs to see Malcolm. ""I know where Mina is,"" she says."

He promises that if he cannot save his daughter he will end her suffering. After Malcolm leaves Gray arrives to see Vanessa. He says he's happy to see she's recovered and asks her to read his future. She refuses saying that he has no future.He argues playfully that everyone does. She quickly retorts that he does not and also turns down his lunch invite. He says he will be waiting for her anyways.

We see Ethan praying at Brona's bedside. She is not doing well. He leaves home and two men follow him.

Malcolm purchases a gun with an ""automatic firing mechanism"" capable of taking down an elephant. While at the store he runs into an old acquaintance named Evelyn a.k.a Madame Kali.

During rehearsal The Creature has an issue with the harness that lifts Maud's boyfriend Simon. The actor is furious and has nasty things to say about him before leaving commanding her to come. Later Maud comes to see him and she thanks him for the book. The Creature calls Maud on Simon's cruel behavior to her. They discuss literature and she kisses him on the cheek before departing.

Vanessa asks Malcolm why he didn't bring him to the ship and why he put the picture of Peter and Mina away. He confesses that the picture breaks his heart and he would sacrifice her life to save Mina's. Vanessa tells him to put the picture back, "" you should have your heart broken.""

The Creature puts on some makeup before going to see Maud to share an orange. She tells him to leave but he loses control, eventually putting her against the wall with his hand. Vincent has no choice but to fire The Creature. He hugs The Creature and sends him on his way. The camera pans up and we see the vampire sleeping in the uppermost rafters.

Vanessa meets Gray at the garden where they'd met previously. He shows her the flower they'd admired is dying. Vanessa tells him she's not the woman he thinks she is and says her feelings for him release something ""unhealthy."" She tells him they cannot be together and departs.

The Creature goes to see Victor, who is furious both with the murder of Van Helsing and the fact he's forcing him to create a mate. With The Creature facing the other direction, Victor pulls out a gun and points it at him. The Creature talks about his soul and the pain he is feeling, then asks Victor to pull the trigger: ""It would be a blessing."" Victor puts down the gun and reaches for The Creature. At this moment Ethan arrives and ask Victor for help.

Ethan brings Victor to Brona's bedside. Brona is concerned for what will happen to her soul since she hasn't been good and that she is frightened. Victor tells Ethan she is near death and asks him for some water. While he's gone Victor tells her about an option beyond death and if she believes such a thing exsists. She says yes and Victor smothers her. Ethan returns and Victor tells him that she has passed and it was thing of grace. Victor then says, ""Don't worry, I'll take care of the body.""

The two men who were following Ethan approach him at a bar. They're there on behalf on his father to bring him back home. Ethan hits them each a few times and leaves.

Malcolm, Vanessa, Ethan, Victor and Sembene arrive at the theater late that night. Just as Malcolm spots the vampire, Ethan is pulled below through a trap door on the stage and is attacked by the Vampire's minions. Ethan, Victor and Sembene fight the women below while Malcolm and Vanessa encounter the vampire. Just as Ethan and Sembene are overtaken by the minions Malcolm is able to stake the vampire. It causes the women to collapse unresponsively. Mina walks out and it looks as if the family will be reunited. Suddenly Mina's eyes darken and she grabs Vanessa from behind. She says she is working on behalf of ""the master"" and Vanessa will be his bride. Malcolm shoots her. While lying on her back Mina says ""I'm your daughter."" Malcolm says ""I have a daughter"" and kills her.

We see Malcolm and Vanessa back at his place. He has replaced the picture and is packing away his gear for his Africa expedition. He weeps and she comforts him in a loving embrace.

Victor shows Brona's body to The Creature. He watches closely as Victor begins the process of reanimation on Brona.

The two men again find Ethan in a bar. He turns into a creature of some kind and kills them.

Vanessa goes to a church and asks to speak with the priest. He asks her what she fears. She says she believes in demons and monsters. She wants to know what to do when science fails. He says he assisted on an exorcism, but says everybody died and nobody found God. He says that if she's actually been touched by the demon it's like being touched by the backhand of God and would make her unique in a way, almost sacred. He asks Vanessa, ""Do you really want to be normal?"" She contemplates this for a moment but the scene ends just before she responds."
