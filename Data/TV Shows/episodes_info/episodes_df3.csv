https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486497/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"Reeling from the death of her parents, 17-year-old Elena becomes interested in a handsome new student named Stefan, who's hiding a dark secret.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Marcos Siega'],"['', '', '']",[],"['reference to a zodiac sign', 'zodiac sign', 'reference to gemini the constellation', 'horoscope', 'reference to a horoscope', 'friendship', 'small town', 'interracial friendship', 'bar', 'murder', 'psychic girl']",[],"The episode begins with a couple, Darren Malloy (Steve Belford) and Brooke Fenton (Cindy Busby), driving their car when, suddenly the area fills with thick fog and they hit someone. They stop to see if the person is injured, however both of them end up being killed by this person.

In the small, Virginia town of Mystic Falls, Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) and her brother Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) cannot come to grips with the fact that their parents had recently died in an crash involving their car driving off the edge of Wickery Bridge and that they are being looked after by their aunt, Jenna (Sara Canning), who acts more like their friend than a parent. Elena becomes emotionally withdrawn after recently breaking up with her boyfriend and former best friend, Matt, while Jeremy turns to drugs to avoid dealing with his own feelings. At school, Elena bumps into the mysterious new student, Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley), after she had just walked out of the men's restroom. The mystery guy attracts Elena's and clearly Caroline's attention.

Elena goes to the cemetery to visit her parents' grave and write in her diary. While writing, a crow appears and refuses to move even when she attempts to scare it away. Suddenly, fog begins to cover everything and Elena starts running, dropping her journal. She trips, gets hurt, and upon standing up, finds Stefan there. While they talk, the smell of blood from Elena's leg seems to cause some changes in Stefan's face who vanishes as Elena lifts her pant leg up to check on the cut. He later goes to Elena's house to apologize for vanishing and returns her journal to her. He reassures her that he didn't read it, seeing as he wouldn't want anyone reading his. Moments later, Elena invites Stefan to The Mystic Grill with Matt, Caroline and Bonnie.

Matt seems upset about his break up with Elena so he talks to Bonnie about it. Caroline walks in so Bonnie goes to talk to her. They take a seat and wait for Stefan and Elena to arrive. Afterwards, Stefan is invited to a campfire party which he agreed to go to if Elena goes to. She agreed.

At the Salvatore house, Zach (Chris William Martin), after seeing the news about the two people who were attacked by an animal, asks Stefan why he came back and why he attacked these people despite his promise not to hurt anyone. Stefan denies that he had anything to do with the attack and leaves to attend the campfire party where Elena will be.

Elena's friend, Bonnie (Kat Graham), tries to make fun of her grandmother who told her that she is a psychic, but she gets a picture of fog, a crow and a cemetery when she touches Elena. Intuitively, she suspects something is strange about Stefan when they meet up at a campfire party after Bonnie touched Stefan. She felt blackness. Death.

Matt's sister Vicki (Kayla Ewell) is found by Jeremy in the woods, bitten by something they believe to be an animal. Stefan realizes that there is someone else in town who is like him and who is also responsible for the first two attacks and he runs back home; Matt watches him and thinks he is acting weird. As his sister is losing a lot of blood, Matt chooses to ignore the red flag. He informs Zach about it and then Stefan's brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder), appears.

Stefan confronts Damon why he is in Mystic Falls despite his dislike of the town. Damon answers that he is in town because of Elena, who looks similar to a girl named Katherine whom Stefan keeps a picture of from 1864. Damon tells Stefan to feed on Elena and the siblings get into a fight. Damon, who is much stronger than his brother because he is feeding on human blood, beats Stefan. Damon takes Stefan's ring which seems important for their survival though its features still seem mysterious, but he then gives it back.

In the meantime, Vicki wakes up at the hospital with Matt by her side. She whispers the words ""vampire"" and then drifts back to sleep. Matt is concerned but doesn't want to wake her."

We've seen Stefan when he's sober and we've also seen him when he's drunk, whether on alcohol or on human blood. But now it's time to really turn the tables on The Vampire Diaries and reveal Stefan for who he really is: a closet blood junkie!

Stefan's a Liar and a Thief

Stefan is still struggling with his human blood addiction and the disturbance he caused in the blood bank just confirms that he really is out of control. What's worse is that he's been lying about it to his girlfriend Elena and his brother Damon, who luckily can see right through him. Stefan isn't pleased about his brother's meddling, especially when Damon spills the beans to Elena and even takes his place as Elena's date at the Founder's Day Gala, where Stefan targets and feeds on his next victim, Amber. Now, he's locked up in the Salvatore basement thanks to Elena's shot of vervain, making room for more Damon-Elena moments.

Bonnie's Back

After skipping town to mourn the death of Grams, Bonnie returns to Mystic Falls and she's cooler than ever. She's warmed up to Caroline and has become cold as stone to Elena because she still blames Stefan and Damon for what happened to her grandmother. But that's not the best part. It looks like she's also been practicing her powers, which seem to work perfectly fine when she used it to stop Stefan from further ravishing Amber.

Uncle John and Pearl

The cloud surrounding Uncle John hasn't cleared up one bit but at least we know why he's not telling on Damon, at least for now. He wants Damon to track down one of Jonathan Gilbert's old inventions, which he suspects is in the possession of Pearl. But Damon doesn't want to help John because he can't really give him what he wants--which is to find Katherine. By the end of the episode, Pearl gives the compass to Damon as a truce while John gains some sort of leverage upon learning that Pearl is the one who wants to buy Elena's father's office and that Jeremy's friend, Anna, is Pearl's daughter.

And now we know the rest of the story--that is the story behind how Stefan and Damon came to be vampires on The Vampire Diaries.

Stefan and Damon's Turn

The Vampire Diaries takes a trip down memory lane, courtesy of Stefan's human blood addiction, and it's 1860s all over again. We specifically time travel to the time when the Salvatore brothers are trying to rescue Katherine from Jonathan Gilbert and his torch-wielding men, who are rounding up all the vampires to seal in the Tomb. In the process of saving Katherine, however, Damon and Stefan get shot by their own father, who already considered his sons dead the moment they sided with the vampires. Damon and Stefan survive, thanks to the blood of Katherine. Apparently, Katherine had been compelling Stefan to drink her blood weeks before she was captured, while Damon voluntarily took it.

Stefan's transition, though somewhat accidental, reveals the most disturbing yet interesting story about the death of his father. Stefan killed his own father as a form of self-defense after his father tried to stab him. And though Stefan wanted to die rather than to turn into a vampire, he wasn't strong enough to resist his father's bloody chest wound so he eventually drank his blood and then became a full-fledged vampire. Damon, on the other hand, doesn't want to go through the transition anymore since he believes Katherine already died when the villagers set fire to the church. But Stefan convinces his brother and even brings a woman he can feed on. Of course, Damon becomes a vampire but swears to make an eternity of misery for Stefan--not because he turned him into a vampire, but because Katherine chose to turn Stefan too.

The Unlikely Alliance

Back in the present, we see the most unlikely alliance: Damon and Alaric teaming up on yet another mission. This time, they head to a house in Grove Hill in hopes of finding Isobel. While the mission itself doesn't reveal much, except for John Gilbert helping the vampires from the Tomb, it makes them realize how much they have in common since both are searching for answers about the women in their lives none of them really want to know. Alaric eventually decides he's done looking for Isobel but life is full of ironies because it turns out Isobel has been looking for him too.

The Tragic End

Good things are finally happening between Jeremy and Anna, who even enrolled in high school so she could be with him. But a happy ending doesn't seem to be in the cards for this couple since Anna has to leave town with her mother Pearl, who decides to leave Mystic Falls after an ugly confrontation with John Gilbert. Anna quietly says goodbye to Jeremy only to discover later that Harper and her mother are dead.

As for Elena, who didn't really do much other than to convince Stefan not to commit suicide by sunlight, she'll deal with bigger and better things in next week's episode as she comes face to face with her birth mother Isobel.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1636337/?ref_=ttep_ep21,,Isobel returns to town and stuns Alaric with her attitude and her demands that he arrange a meeting with Elena.,[],TV-14,Release date,['J. Miller Tobin'],"['', '', '']",[],"['witch', 'interracial friendship', 'bar', 'forbidden love', 'small town']",[],"Synopsis Submitted by: BuddyTV.com

There are a lot of things going on in this episode of The Vampire Diaries but the main focus is on Elena. On one hand, she's dealing with the fact her spiteful birthmother is in town. On the other, she's also dealing with an angry brother who doesn't want anything to do with her. Plus, there's a bunch of other stuff like tainted friendships, hidden romantic feelings and some daddy drama.

Meeting Isobel The much-awaited reunion between Alaric and his dead vampire wife Isobel finally happens but it doesn't really reveal much except for the fact Isobel is now a different, more wicked person, and the main reason she's in Mystic Falls is to get Jonathan Gilbert's device, now in Damon's possession. Knowing Damon deeply cares for Elena, Isobel orders Alaric to set up a meeting with her daughter, who then agrees to face her birth mother since she doesn't have a choice. Unfortunately, the meeting doesn't go well because instead of getting answers on who her birth father is, all Elena gets is the burden of knowing if she doesn't get the device from Damon, Isobel will be going on a killing spree of the people she cares about.

Isobel's Game Plan

There's no such thing as a coincidence on The Vampire Diaries, so assuming Isobel's arrival in Mystic Falls has something to do with John Gilbert is pretty easy. What most of us didn't know is they're actually working together to recover Jonathan Gilbert's device as part of Katherine's orders. And Isobel's game plan is just part of a bigger game plan Katherine cooked up--which is to use the device (a weapon against vampires) to kill all the vampires from the tomb, including Damon and Stefan.

Jonathan Gilbert's Device

It turns out Jonathan never really invented anything but Emily made it look like he did because, although she pledged her loyalty to Katherine, she still couldn't stand the fact a lot of people were suffering. Of course, we learn this through Bonnie, courtesy of Emily's spell book. After Elena gets the device from Damon, Bonnie tries to help Elena by casting a spell on the device to rid it of its power before giving it to Isobel. But apparently, Bonnie is one devious little witch because she just lied to Elena and didn't do what she promised.

History Repeats Itself

The Damon and Elena pairing, though nothing official has happened yet, is getting more screen time even now Stefan is well from his human blood addiction and back to his boring old self. Damon obviously enjoys the banter between him and Elena whenever they talk on the phone and has made it pretty clear to Isobel threatening the people he cares about, especially Elena, is not OK. If that's not enough, even Isobel points out to Elena that Damon's in love with her that's why he easily gave her the device. All the Damon-Elena closeness is finally sinking in on Stefan, so he threatens Damon not to go down that road again. But it looks like Damon isn't about to give up that easily. Wow, this episode really does make you feel sorry for Damon and wish he and Elena can be together instead of Stefan. But maybe that's just me.

Daddy Issues

Damon was right when he said that things are going into an interesting direction on The Vampire Diaries. We learn Isobel and John Gilbert dated way back then and their relationship resulted into a daughter, also known as Elena. It's too bad (or good) Stefan will have to break this big bombshell to Elena while Damon will once again shine as the ""friend"" who's always there to listen.

Other Developments:

-Matt and Tyler are still at odds but are on the road to patching things up.

-It turns out Isobel isn't completely dead inside because not only does she want what's best for Elena (by getting rid of the Salvatore vamps), she also cares enough to erase Alaric's memory so his heart will be Isobel free once and for all.

-Jeremy tells Elena he knows what Anna is and he has been reading her journal, which reveals his memory of Vicki has been erased. He also learns more about his family's history through Uncle John.

-Anna tells Jeremy about her mom's death and feels helpless than ever.

Brad (Damon Wayans Jr.), Alex (Elisha Cuthbert), Dave (Zachary Knighton) and Max (Adam Pally) all receive an email from Shershow (T.J. Miller) inviting them to his wedding. Jane (Eliza Coupe) & Penny (Casey Wilson) arrive and they have also been invited. Jane is annoyed that it's on the same day as her & Brad's wedding anniversary. Brad clearly has forgotten this. Penny can't believe the Shershow is getting married before her- he was her ""safety"". Everyone decides that with Shershow getting married, Max has become the new Shershow.

Alex's apartment

The three girls are discussing Alex's lack of sex-life lately when Dave walks in. He correctly picks what they were discussing, stating he's fine with it because they are now friends & trying to join in. Alex starts to but Dave realises that hearing about that kind of stuff is easier said than done and leaves.

Brad & Jane's apartment

Max has been asked to officiate Shershow's wedding and states that he now needs to apply for an online marriage licence. Jane corrects him that he surely means ""renew"" his marriage licence because he officiated her & Brad's wedding. Max admits that he didn't actually have a licence then and Jane realises that this means she can finally have her perfect wedding.

Hotel foyer in Wisconsin

Brad has talked to a lawyer and all Jane and he need to do is sign some papers to be officially married. Jane won't drop her ""perfect wedding"" idea. Max's luggage is literally stuffed into a plastic shopping bag which causes the group to point this out as another reason he is the new Shershow. He claims he's not and bets that he can make them all cry at the ceremony to prove it. He thinks Penny is the new Shershow.

Shershow enters with his fiancee Melinda (June Diane Raphael) and everyone is amazed at how hot she is. Shershow admits that he thought he'd have to rely on the pact he made with Penny in his role as her ""safety"" and then asks how she's doing. Penny panics and says he's engaged before excusing herself. Melinda says she's heard so much about the gang and addresses them all individually. She addresses Alex coldly however and after she leaves, Shershow says that Melinda thinks Alex is a 'wedding jinx'.

Various locations in the hotel

Penny tells Brad & Jane that she thinks she's made a huge mistake and we see that the very-gay Derrick (Stephen Guarino) has been called in as her pseudo-fiance. Meanwhile, Alex & Dave reaffirm their friendship by agreeing to be each other's wingmen.

Penny introduces Shershow to Derrick, who decides to play straight by acting like . Shershow is clearly baffled for what to make of Derrick.

Jane continues to try convince Brad that another wedding is a good idea by pointing out things he loves that they couldn't have at their first wedding for various reasons.

Alex & Dave are scouting the bar and Dave sees a girl he likes the look of. Alex plays her part as wingman and after walking away, Alex states that she's ""never felt so smart"".

It's time for speeches before the wedding. We see that the dumb girl is Melinda's best friend. We also see a very drunk Penny who decides to make a speech before falling over with the lecturn.

Alex & Jane head back to their rooms. After saying goodnight to Jane, Alex decides to knock on Dave's door only to come face to face with the dumb girl naked.

The next morning

Alex and Dave talk about the night before and Dave admits who he slept with. He states that ""this friends thing- it's kinda nice"". Alex agrees but looks a bit awkward.

Penny is hungover but sees Shershow packing the car out the window. She realises he's got cold feet and goes to give him a pep talk, convincing him that he's not the Shershow of old and deserves to be happy.

Cut to the wedding

All is going well until Melinda reaches the end of the aisle. She looks panicked, whispers in her father's ear and runs off. Alex goes after her and gives a big speech about how she's regret it if she doesn't go through with the wedding. Melinda says she only ran off because her bustier broke. The awkwardness increases when Alex turns around to find that Dave has heard her spiel.

Max makes everyone cry as officiant.

Dancefloor at Reception

Alex looks bored off to the side. Dave approaches and she brushes off what he overheard as her trying anything to get Melinda back to the ceremony.

Jane & Brad are dancing. Jane decides that she doesn't need a perfect wedding. The fact that Brad was going to go along with it shows that he's the perfect husband and that is all she needs.

When claiming his winnings off Penny at the reception, she is looking depressed so Max gives her a pep talk and she perks up, claiming that Max is her ""gayfty"".

Dancing by all (including Derrick and some other man he met during the ceremony)."

She free falls to the street, swipes a a half gallon of milk from a shopper's bag by slicing it free and swipes a man's wallet. He gives chase but she eludes him by shimmying up a fire escape. She heads to an alley and feeds an alley cat some of the milk.

She slinks away again as Thomas and Martha Wayne enter the alley, accompanied by their young son Bruce. A mugger confronts the family and demands money and Martha's necklace. The man then shoots both people right in front of Bruce. The masked man spares Bruce, who screams in anguish over his parents dead bodies as Selina looks on from above.

The precinct is a hive of activity that night. A large perp grabs a cop and holds her hostage with a gun to her head demanding his pills. Jim Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie) comes and takes control of the situation and offers him some aspirin and then handily disarms him. His fellow cops start beating the the perp, despite Jim's attempts to stop them. An older cop, Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue), pulls him away and chastises him for not taking a shot instead, calls it a rookie move.

The pair, who are newly partnered, catch the Waynes' murders in the theatre district. Bullock realizes who the victims are and tries to convince the beat cop on the scene to call Major Crimes, but the beat cop tells him no.

In an attempt to get Bruce to open up, Jim tells Bruce about the death of his own father in a collision with a drunk driver, to show that he empathizes with Bruce's situation, and shows that no matter how dark and scary the world is right now, there will be light. Gordon asks him to tell him everything and he recounts the scene, how the man had shiny shoes and shot his parents for no reason. Jim promises to bring the killer to justice. The Waynes' butler, Alfred Pennyworth, arrives on the scene and Bruce runs to embrace him. Alfred correctly assesses from Gordon's earnest demeanor that he is new to the Gotham PD and wishes him luck.

Gordon and Bullock head to a diner to assess. Bullock wants to get rid of the case noting that there will be heavy pressure on them and lots of media scrutiny since the Waynes were billionaire philanthropists. Another set of cops, Renee Montoya (female) and Crispus Allen (male), enter and try to convince Bullock and Gordon to give the case to them and the Major Crimes Unit. But Montoya gets up in Bullock's face and accuses him, essentially, of being dirty and pisses him off and so they keep the case, which is what Gordon wanted since he promised Bruce.

Bullock and Gordon go back to the precinct where, alongside their female captain, they watch the mayor on TV saying they will close this case quickly. Bullock asks for a private moment with the captain. Gordon steps out and watches as Bullock basically asks for a new partner. He is declined. He gets up in Gordon's face, sneering over the fact that Gordon is some kind of war hero and his father was the DA back in the old days. He asks him to ask for a transfer and says Gotham is no place for nice guys. Gordon says he wants to be where the action is and that Bullock a cynic who is lackadaisical and slovenly. Bullock says it's time to roust some muggers.

After a montage of ruffians basically tells them they know nothing, they go see forensics geek Edward Nygma, who explains that the bullets used by the muggers were very expensive. Gordon thinks since the guy used high end bullets and had shiny shoes that it might have been a contract killer. Bullock says it's time to go see Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith).

Fish is the right hand woman of gangster Carmine Falcone, and the theatre district where the murder happened is her turf. Bullock and Gordon enter her nightclub but she's busy out back beating up an employee named Raul who has been stealing from. She is surrounded by a group of big thugs and one pasty guy who is holding a black umbrella over her head. She goes to talk with Harvey and Jim and the pasty guy, Oswald Cobblepot, takes over the beating of Raul, which he seems to enjoy.

Bullock and Fish--who seem very chummy-- have a private chat while Gordon goes to check out the beating scene. Since Gordon is with Bullock the thugs figure that Gordon too will be in their pocket. He disabuses them of this notion but he does stop the beating. He heads back in to see Bullock and Fish sharing a kiss on the lips and a friendly goodbye.

Gordon heads home with his fiance, Barbara. They're both all dudded up to go somewhere but Gordon begs off whatever the occasion is and they decide to stay in. She compliments his suit and says it's good to see him out of his uniform. He admits he may be out of his depth with the Wayne case. She says she has faith in him and that if he's out of his depth it's time to swim. He says he will. They start making out. (Bow chicka wow wow).

In the morning, Bullock calls Gordon from a bar and says he has a tip from Fish. Gordon meets him and they head to the home of one Mario Pepper, a petty criminal who has a long rap sheet. They enter his home and question him while his wife and daughter look on. When Bullock and Gordon intimate that they are going to have a look around his place, Pepper pulls a gun and takes off. After a lengthy foot chase and fistfight with Gordon across rooftops, through restaurants, and down alleys, Pepper has Gordon pinned down and Harvey saves his partner by shooting the man. Gordon thanks him.

The CSIs going through Pepper's house discover Martha Wayne's pearl necklace in a bag of drugs. They've got their man. They are hailed as heroes in the paper and are given a welcome befitting just that back at the precinct house.

Montoya and Allen get a visit from Oswald, who slides into the back seat of their car to inform them that Pepper was framed by the cops, that the necklace was planted on him, and that he knows this because he saw Fish with the necklace and then she was talking to Bullock. They wonder why he's telling them this. He says news of that sad orphan struck his heart. They see through this knowing that Cobblepot wants to push Fish out and be the big man. He says either way his story is true and they should check it out.

They go to the Wayne's funeral and Gordon apologizes to Bruce that there would be no trial since Pepper is dead. They shake hands. Selina Kyle looks on from atop a nearby gravestone.

Montoya promptly takes the Penguin's tip to Barbara. Apparently, the female detective and the pretty blond have an intimate history. Montoya accuses Gordon of being in on the frame up and Barbara protests that Gordon is the most honest man she knows.

Later that evening it's clear to Jim that something is wrong and Barbara tells him what happened. The next day he confronts Montoya and says that he was not in on it and he'll find out how it happened and to stay out of his way.

Jim goes back to Mario Pepper's to look at his shoes: not a single pair of them is shiny like Bruce noted to him. He realizes it was a frame up.

He goes to confront Bullock and says maybe Falcone wanted the Wayne's dead and that's why Fish was involved. Bullock essentially shakes it off saying they might have killed an innocent man and the real killers may still be out there but he doesn't care because if they stir things up, at the very least they will lose their jobs if not worse. Gordon doesn't care for this answer and goes to confront Fish, who promptly sets her thugs on him and then whacks him unconscious with a vase.

The next day, Barbara goes to the precinct looking for Gordon saying he went out for a walk and never came back. Bullock lies and says he was on a stakeout. He goes to find his partner, who has been dragged into a meat locker by Fish's minions and is strung up by his feet. Bullocks asks to talk to Fish who is auditioning a comedian -- the Joker perhaps-- and he convinces her to let Gordon go and says one of her people snitched on her to Major Crimes. She makes him promise to keep Gordon under control. Bullock promises. He gives the phone back to one Fish's minions and she says Bullock just threatened her and that he should kill him and Gordon. The thug knocks out Bullock.

Fish turns to Oswald and has him rub her feet. She tells him that Carmine is going soft and it's time for a new boss and says he's been like a son to her. He wholeheartedly agrees with all of this. And then she says she doesn't understand why he betrayed his mother. She knows he was the snitch since only he saw her with the pearl necklace. He tries to pin it on one of the other thugs. She says that guy is loyal. He says he's loyal to her and would open a vein right now for her. She hands him a knife and tells him to prove his loyalty and calls him Penguin. He gets upset. She attacks and beats him with a chair.

Jim and Harvey hang upside down and note that they have had better days. A scary guy with a mask enters and picks up a butcher knife. Just then a bunch of armed men and shoots most of the thugs. They are led by Carmine Falcone himself. He tells the lead thug that Fish is too impulsive and that there are rules and tells him to cut them down.

Falcone tells Gordon that he knew his dad and he was the best DA Gotham ever had and they had mutual respect and friendship. Gordon is skeptical saying he knows that Falcone runs the mayor and the police department. Falcone says to trust him and that he knows Gordon will do the right thing. Gordon says he will tell what he knows but of course he can't prove Falcone killed the Waynes. Falcone says some thug killed them but that Pepper was framed so the people of Gotham could have swift justice and feel secure. He says he's a businessman and you can't have organized crime without law and order and he loves this city and it's falling apart and he doesn't want to see that happen. Gordon can't believe he wants him to keep quiet. Falcone says Gotham is on a knife edge and if Jim brings down the mayor and police the city wouldn't get better.

Bullock tells Gordon that he wasn't ready for the truth. Gordon says he was ashamed. They stop the car and Oswald is in the trunk. Bullock tells him that Falcone wants Gordon to walk Oswald to the pier and make sure he's dead to prove he's ""with the program."" And if he doesn't Bullock is supposed to kill them both. Bullock says he likes Gordon but he will have to try to kill him. And even if he can't, someone will eventually and then they will kill Bullock too and probably Barbara too. Gordon doesn't want to. Bullock says he's killed people before. Gordon points out that was in the war. Bullock argues sometimes you have to do bad to do good and if he doesn't do this bad thing, he and Barbara will die. Gordon leads Oswald away. Oswald offer to be his spy in the coming war for Falcone's territory. He fires a shot but doesn't kill Oswald, instead telling him, before he falls into the water, to never return to Gotham.

Gordon goes home and embraces Barbara.

Gordon goes to Bruce and apologizes that they killed the wrong man. Bruce actually seems glad, saying he wants to see the man again. Gordon offers his badge and says Bruce has a choice to stay silent while he works to find the real killer or take his badge and go to the police and tell the truth. Baby Batman picks the first option and hands Gordon his badge back. As Gordon leaves, Selina Kyle watches from atop a nearby wall.

Oswald surfaces on the other side of the river. He slashes the throat of a nearby fisherman and eats his sandwich maniacally."

We open on Bruce Wayne holding his hand over a candle flame, testing the limits of his pain. Alfred comes in but doesn't catch him. But he notices him hiding his hand and takes a look and is aghast and angry. He grabs him and calls him a stupid little boy and then hugs him and apologizes and says it will be alright.

We cut to Selina Kyle in a dirty alley hanging with some vagrants. Patty and Doug from the mayor's homelss outreach project show up with food and candy. ""Cat"" as she is known declines. But they turn out to be villains and poison and shoot the homeless, throwing one through the plate glass window of a restaurant.

The next morning Jim and Harvey come to investigate while Selina looks on from on high. One of the homeless was a veteran. Harvey doesn't care that he was a vet. He salutes his service but says he's now a dead bum. The beat cop was checking out the restaurant scene. Jim thinks the ""bum"" may be related to the victim. The cop says the restaurant pays him to look after them and he wasn't going to babysit a dead bum. Jim calls him a bad cop and they fight.

Jim and Harvey talk to the kid thrown through the window. He explains about the woman with the pin and says homeless kids have been disappearing for weeks. Harvey doesn't believe him and thinks the kid is the killer and wants to beat a confession out of him. The kid says to ask ""Cat."" Jim pulls off the overzealous Harvey and tells him beating suspects is illegal. Harvey brings up Gordon putting ""a man in the river."" Harvey says he doesn't care about a dead snitch or Gordon's guilty conscience. They fight and bump into another guy and Harvey kicks him.

Oswald is hobbling along the road. A car stops to give him a ride and it's a couple of young guys.They offer him a beer. They ask him what happened. He says it was his own fault and his own foolish arrogance led him astray. He says he will be back. One of the guys notes he walks like a penguin and Oswald promptly stabs him in the neck with a broken beer bottle.

Smash cut to: Gotham.

Harvey and Jim argue with the Captain who thought Jim was ""on board."" She tells them to get back to work. Jim tells the Captain about the homeless snatchers. Ed Nygma lingers outside. He say the kid had a fast acting knock out drug that they used to use at the Arkham Asylum-- which has been closed for years-- to knock out patients. Captain says to keep it quiet. Jim wants to tell people as a warning. She says no press, it's an order.

They head to talk to Fish whose turf this happened on. Harvey wonders if they should go see if Fish is still mad at them. Carmine enters Fish's club for a chat. He says he spoke to Oswald before his death and that he said the deaths of the Waynes would bring troubled times for Carmine and the city. He agrees saying without the Wayne's Gotham is out of balance. Fish says he shouldn't worry about his enemies. Carmine says he's worried about his friends and that Oswald told him that Fish said that he was getting old and it was time for her take over. She swears she never said that. He puts it aside. He asks after her. She says she's good. He asks which man in the club is her lover. She says her heart has been broken too many times for that nonsense. She says if she's referring to the boy she keeps around for exercise he is not her lover. Carmine calls the bartender over and tells him to be good to Fish because if he breaks her heart he will break Lazlo's heart. He then swiftly has him beaten up right in the club. He kisses Fish's hand and thanks her being honest. After he lives, a near teary Fish kicks everyone out.

Allen and Montoya go to see Oswald's very quirky mother-- played by Carol Kane-- who doted on her boy. They ask if she knows anyone who would do him harm. She says it must be a woman who has him in her clutches. Montoya isn't buying that.

Back at the club, Fish's head thug Butch is telling her it was too early to make a move on Falone. She says she knows she needs more money, men, and territory but one day she swears she's going to kill that old man with her bare hands nad teeth. Butch offers to hold her shoes. She says she wishes Oswald was still alive since she didn't make him suffer enough.

Oswald drives up to an old dude in the farm country and rents his trailer for $100 a week. The guy notices his truck and Oswald runs to cover up the bodies in bags in the back.

The homeless kids wake up in a dank room. They look down a hole in the center of the room that never seems to end. They worry this spells doom.

Harvey and Jim pay Fish a visit and she seems happy to see them. ""I knew I'd regret killing you as soon as I gave the word, but you know me, I'm feisty,"" she says. She notes Jim's murder of the Penguin and says he's just a sinner like her and she's a little sad about his death. They ask about the kid snatching. She says there is a buyer overseas taking healthy kids but no one knows why and no one cares to know.

Jim tells Barbara about the kid-snatching and how he can't tell the press. She says she can't believe how corrupt things are. He says she has no idea. She wonders if he's been okay lately, he says he can't sleep. She says to call in an anonymous tip. He says he can't tell them. She calls the Gotham Gazette. He gets angry that she did that and says she can't do that with stuff he tells her. She says it was the right thing to do. He says it was but not to do it again.

The next day the Captain slams down the paper with the front page story about child snatching. Harvey and Jim both claim ignorance. They go to investigate the dealers of the knock-out drug.

We cut to Patty and Doug who are being confronted by the guy who has been warehousing the kids and supplying them with the drug, he's mad about the story in the paper and that it will bring heat. He wants more money. They say they don't have it. They say the ""dollmaker"" needs the children. So she knocks out one of the guy's thugs with her poison pen, just as the Jim and Harvey show up.

Outside Harvey tells Jim to ""control your woman"" when he deduces Barbara dropped the dime. Harvey talks about loving all kinds of women and pegs Jim for the kind of guy he is: high school sweetheart, whores overseas who made him sad, and then love of his life Barbara.

Harvey and Jim confront the boss, Quillin, and says they have a warrant. A shootout with Patty and Doug ensues and they escape. Quillin orders his thug to kill the kids and clean the room. Jim overhears this, shoots the thug, who falls down the hole, and finds the kids.

The mayor holds a press conference in the police precinct and thanks Jim and Harvey and says he will protect the kids. He rounds up street kids-- in handcuffs-- and deposits them in children's services. Later he tells Jim that the cute and undamaged ones are going to foster homes and essentially to prison upstate for the rest. The mayor says homeless kids need structure. Jim says he's using the kid snatchers as a pretext to lock homeless kids. They both know where they stand and they toast.

Aflred comes to see Jim and asks him to come visit at teatime the next day.

At home Bruce is drawing disturbing pictures and listening to loud rock music.

As Selina is being put on the bus she asks to speak to Jim Gordon. The admitting woman disagrees. Selina pulls her locket out of her pocket and smiles at the picture of the woman inside. Suddenly we discover Doug and Patty are the drivers of the Corrections buses. Selina makes a break for the back door of the bus and Patty pulls out a gun and stops her and warns the other children to stay seated. The buses depart.

Harvey beats Quillin in lock up for information. Jim doesn't stop him. Quillin tells them about the Patty and Doug and how their truck had a picture of a plate and a fork on it. He intuits that maybe they eat them?

The kids are offloaded and Patty and Doug put them in cargo containers. One kids missing. Selina hides on the bus. Patty goes to look for her. Selina eludes her and slides under the bus. Doug says it doesn't matter since they have more than enough. Patty says the dollmaker will be pleased.

Jim and Harvey come up empty on the plate/fork trucks. Jim realizes it's not a plate and fork it's a trident just as the doors shut on the Trident shipping containers. One of Patty and Doug's thugs arrives with his eyes scratched out. Patty shoots him in the head. Selina continues to slink around trying to get away. She drops her locket and gets Patty's attention. She holds up her hands as if she's going to surrender just as Jim arrives and takes down Patty. Jim asks her name. She asks why that's his business. Harvey corrals Doug.

Jim goes to see Bruce. Alfred first tells him about the nightmares, the cutting and burning. Alfred says there will be no psychiatrists which was his father's orders which was to trust him to choose his own course. Bruce enters and says he knows Alfred brought him there to talk some sense into him. Bruce says he's fine and that Alfred is a worrywart. Jim says Bruce should talk to someone. Jim claims he talks about what he saw in the war, a little. Bruce knows he's lying. Jim doesn't want him to hurt himself. He says he burned his hand testing himself. Bruce says he's been following Jim's exploits in the paper and feels bad for the homeless kids. He wants to give them money. Jim says it doesn't work that way. Bruce donates clothes instead.

It turns out the kids will still be going upstate, in their new duds! Selina protests and again asks for Gordon or threatens, the very nice-seeming man helping her, that she will say he touched her. He goes to fetch her.

Oswald lays on the floor of his trailer and looks up at his handiwork on your typical murderer's wall of crazy--or in this case ceiling: photos, newspaper clippings, drawings. He gets a call on a cell phone. One of the kids is still alive and Oswald is trying to ransom him. The parents think their son is trying to prank them and hang up. Oswald notes that's disappointing. He tells the bound and gagged kid: ""You must be quite the scamp.""

Jim talks to Cat. She offers to trade him info to get out of the precinct. She says she's been watching him and knows he's friends with ""the boy"" meaning Bruce. She says she saw who killed the Waynes, clear as day."

Oswald Cobblepot gets off a city bus, back in Gotham and happy to see corruption and crime still afoot.

A breaking news report on a nearby TV tells us that a businessman is out on bail awaiting trial for a Ponzi scheme bilked a half a billion dollars. We cut to the man, Danzer, telling his lawyer to bribe whoever is necessary to get him off. He leaves and is accosted by a man in a pig mask selling balloons from a cart. The man IDs him, handcuffs him to a weather balloon and Danzer rises into the sky.

Gordon and Bullock go to investigate but there's not much to work with. Bullock thinks it's good riddance to bad rubbish. Meanwhile, when they get back to the precinct Gordon meets Lt. Cranston a crazy guy who likes to beat perps with a trophy and thinks Gordon is a ""boy scout."" Back at their desks Bullock says the guy is a legend. Gordon thinks he's a thug. Gordon wants to work the balloonman case but Bullock isn't interested. Gordon knows that Bullock thinks the same of Mario Pepper, the guy framed for the Waynes murder, and Oswald Cobblepot.

Selina shows up and Gordon signs her into his custody. She takes him to the alley and explains what she saw. He notes she hasn't told him anything that most people don't know and she can't prove she was there. She says she saw the killer's face before he covered it because she can see in the dark. She says she dropped the guy's wallet she snatched into the sewer. He cuffs her to a nearby railing and goes down in the sewer and finds it. She uses the pen she stole from Bullock and undoes the cuffs and drops them down in the sewer with him and takes off.

Allen and Montoya go to see Fish Mooney who tells them Oswald is in fact dead and that she heard that Gordon pulled the trigger on the order of Carmine Falcone.

They confront Gordon back at the precinct-- who is scraping sewer muck off his shoes and calling Child Services to say he lost Selina-- and he wonders when they became Internal Affairs. He says he didn't kill Cobblepot and to come back when they have proof.

After a lively round of fencing in the study, Alfred finds police reports-- complete with gruesome photos-- about the Wayne's murder. He asks Bruce how he got them. He says it was easy and he's looking for clues. An angry Alfred asks if he found any. Bruce admits he didn't. Alfred tells him to let Gordon work on the case. Bruce wonders if he'll figure it out. Alfred says he knows he will definitely try.

Oswald is recognized on the street by a thug who knows Fish will pay big money for him. Oswald stabs and robs him and buys himself a nice tuna fish sandwich.

Later, when he tries to get a job as a dishwasher at an Italian restaurant and is turned down because they are staffed up and the manager notes he doesn't even have the right shoes, Oswald spies the dishwasher and his shoes. So later, off camera, he kills said dishwasher, takes his shoes and his job. The manager says he's a dishwasher and needs to know his place and be quiet. The manager meets a mafioso in the dining room and we realizes this is why Oswald wants to work there, to be close to mobsters.

The restaurant is called Bamonte's and he overhears a mobster talking trash about Falcone. The mobster sees Oswald and asks if he heard anything. He claims his name is Paolo and he didn't hear a thing. The guy gives him some money and winks at him.

Back at the precinct Gordon tells Bullock about Montoya and Allen confronting him about Oswald. Bullock tells him not to worry about it or Pepper or the Wayne's. Bullock tells him to let it go. They go to talk to a man who owns a weather balloon company about Danzer's flight. The guy says the balloon was stolen by a former employee named Carl, who stole four balloons.

The balloon man then strikes again, his next target: Lt. Cranston. Cranston roughs him up first and finds something interesting in his pocket and then he floats away.

Bruce reads the news with great interest. Alfred is worried he hasn't been eating. He wants him to keep his strength up. He says he's not hungry.

Barbara asks Gordon is okay since he hardly slept and since the balloonman killed a cop, she wonders if he's in trouble. He says no, he's just troubled that nobody cared when Danzer floated away but now that it's a cop the investigation will get support and that's not only not fair it creates vigilantes. Everyone has to matter or no one matters. She points out that this is not his fault. She says he's giving people faith since he caught the Wayne killer and he's a hero. He kisses her goodbye.

A breaking news report has folks on the street excited and scared about the balloonman. The Captain is mad that it's on the news and wants to know how the case is coming. Bullock is convinced that the balloon thief is their guy. Gordon isn't convinced since the thief is an idiot. Bullock says he'll make the guy guilty. Gordon says the next victim will be known and corrupt. Bullock says they'll find him.

They go to talk to whores and thugs and food truck guys to try and ferret the guy out. Bullock actually gets a good tip and they find him. His Amazonian girlfriend roughs up Bullock while Gordon arrests the guy. After Gordon saves Bullock and he gets up and slugs the woman.

Fish instructs one of her thugs to kill some folks including Carmine's current side piece and her own boy toy that took the beating from Falcone's men.

Montoya lets herself into Barbara's apartment. Barbara is getting high. Montoya wonders if this is ""all"" she is doing. Barbara says it is and now that she's called her a drug addict she can leave now. Montoya tells her that Gordon killed Oswald. Barbara knows that she's jealous. Montoya says she's been sober for a year and although that doesn't excuse what she did she can't stand seeing her with this man and kisses her. Barbara tells her to leave. Montoya asks her to ask Gordon about where he was night the murder.

Gordon and Bullock interrogate the balloon thief who says he sold the balloon to a masked man. He then points out the balloon will eventually pop as we see Cranston's pocket come back down right on top of a woman on the street. As they head to the crime scene they hear that the third victim was a Catholic cardinal known as a ""diddler."" A piece of paper in an evidence bag from Cranston's pocket is handed to them and Bullock wonders why Gordon's name is on it. Gordon looks at it and says he knows who the balloon man is.

There's one balloon left.

Gordon figures out that the balloonman is the guy from Child Services who dropped off Selina. It turns out that he was known as a sweet, good guy. All the well known, corrupt officials are in hiding. The captain is mad. They have an APB out on the guy.

They deduce where he might have stored the balloons and head out to find him. They find the balloon and the guy pulls a gun on Bullock. The guy says the cops should be helping him. He monologues about the lack of justice and how he didn't make a difference as a caretaker of the lost children of Gotham so he decided it was time to teach the corrupt cops and politicians what justice really means. He gives up and shoots at Gordon. Bullock grabs him and attaches him to the last balloon asking how it feels to be hoisted on his own petard. Gordon aghast, grabs on to the guy. Bullock tells him to let go, Gordon says to shoot the balloon. Bullock shoots the ballone and they fall back to earth. Hard.

Carmine goes to see Fish. She asks after his girlfriend. He says she had an accident. Fish says she hopes the mugger paid with their life. Carmine says they will when they find him and whoever helped him. He asks if he heard anything Maroney's camp about Arkham. (The mobster mentioned Arkham in his conversation with Oswald.) He tells her to keep her eyes open.

As they put balloon man in the ambulance he tells Gordon there will be more. Gordon says he will try to achieve justice. Balloon man says Gordon had his chance. Gordon asks who his final victim was going to be.

Bruce and Alfred see the news report and Alfred notes that criminals must be sleeping well. Bruce points out that balloon man killed people so he was a criminal too. Alfred agrees. Bruce eats dinner and watches the news. The reporter openly editorializes now that balloon man is captured who will protect Gotham.

A bruised Gordon heads home. Barbara is relieved he's okay. She asks what's wrong and that he can tell her anything. He says the city is sick in a way that he didn't realize. When he asked balloon man who his final target was he said it didn't matter since everyone is on the take. Barbara says it's not true. Gordon says it doesn't matter it's the perception and if people take the law into their own hands there is no law and they will be lost. He says there are cops who do it. She says he never would right? He asks if she thinks he could. She says no, she knows him and she loves him. There is a knock at the door, it's Oswald.

We pick up right where we left off with Cobblepot showing up at Jim and Barbara's door.

He says ""Hello, old friend."" He pretends to be a man named Peter Humboldt, an ""old friend."" He charms Barbara. He says he's recently back in Gotham and wanted to pop by. Jim sees him out and throws him against a wall. He notes that he told him not to come back and he should kill him right now since if Falcone finds out he's alive he will kill them both. Cobblepot says Gotham is his home and he had nowhere else to go. He, calmly, understands Jim's frustration but says he's here to offer him help and he knows he's a good man. He notes Fish, Harvey and everyone else lie to him but Cobblepot won't. He asks him to either kill him now or trust him. Cobblepot says he can be his secret agent in the coming war and that he won't be found out because no one looks for a dead man. Jim asks ""What war?"" Cobblepot says war is just politics by another name and the coming war will be over Arkham. Some kids runs by and Cobblepot runs off.

Later that night a city councilman is approached by a constituent, this constituent turns out to be an assassin and he kills him and his aide with a devices that shoots a spike into their eye. It's supergross. To add insult to fatal injury the assassin notes that he really did vote for the councilman.

The captain brings the double homicide to Gordon and Bullock. Jim thinks it may be political. Harvey thinks politicians are usually bribed not killed.

Over at Fish's she's auditioning a new female singer. Fish says the job requires more than a singer, she needs a fierce female. She asks if she likes girls or boys, the singer says boys. Fish says to pretend she's a boy and seduce her. The singer starts rubbing her shoulders. Fish is unimpressed, she tells Butch to ""put a pin in this one"" and dismisses the girl. Butch points out that she's a pretty girl. Fish says she's not looking for a girl, she's looking for a weapon.

Jim and Harvey interview a potential suspect in the councilman's murder. Harvey tries to strong arm him but Jim knows he's not their guy. When he gets back to his desk there is a box of papers concerning Arkham.

We cut to the mayor at a press conference explaining that Arkham is the last major piece of undeveloped land in Gotham. Before their death the Waynes wanted to build a progressive development plan for the area which is currently a shantytown. They wanted to convert it into affordable housing. The mayor stands before a map of the city and a mock-up of what the new Arkham district would look like with gleaming new buildings and a new cutting edge mental health facility to replace Arkham Asylum. A competing proposal is to tear down the asylum and use the land for a waste disposal facility. The mayor says the Wayne plan is better and he's endorsing it.

At Bamonte's Maroney is crowing that a lucrative deal is coming his way in the form of land. Cobblepot eavesdrops on his conversation from the kitchen and watches as men bring in big bags of money.

Jim goes to see Alfred to learn about the Wayne's Arkham plan. Alfred explains that Falcone was actually backing the Wayne's plan because he stood to gain from it. Jim is confused why the councilman was killed then. Alfred explains about the opposing waste management plan and that it is backed by Falcone's enemy Maroney. Bruce overhears this. He reads to Jim from his parents plan on building a new asylum and their plan to help the city's least fortunate as a symbol of hope. Bruce doesn't want to see his parents plan fail. Jim says he understands that but this fight could be the spark for a citywide gang war and innocent people will die and whatever faith people have in the police will be crushed. Bruce says he has to stop it.

Harvey calls Jim and tells him another councilman has been abducted. This time it was one that was in the bag for Maroney. We see the assassin has him in an oil drum. He rolls the drum through the gates of the old Arkham, pours gas on him and lights him on fire, which would not be the assassin's own choice since he prefers things quick and clean. The man begs for his life, the assassin lights the fire.

Bullock, Gordon and the Captain investigate and she is convinced Jim was right that it's political. Jim explains about Maroney vs. Falcone and the fight over the council vote on Arkham. Bullock wants to know how he knows so much all of a sudden. Ed Nygma shows up and explains how the murders were carried out were likely killed by the same person, which is confusing that opposing sides would hire the same assassin.

Cobblepot watches as Maroney's men count big stacks of money. The manager yells at him for snooping. Cobblepot apologlzes but he's clearly forming a plan.

Harvey and Jim go see a guy in prison for information on their hitman. They get his name, Gladwell, and head to his place of business. He sees them coming and takes off. Jim heads after him and is closing in but Bullock calls him back saying he found something on his desk: clippings of the councilmen. Jim sees a piece of paper with the letters ""C L M"" written on it and he knows it's some kind of clue.

Bruce awakens gasping from a nightmare. Alfred enters and asks if he was in it. Bruce says not this time. Bruce asks to see all the files on the Arkham plan, he's looking for a connection between the councilmen's murders and his parents.

Masked gunmen bust into Bamonte's and shoot the place up, stealing bags of cash and murdering the manager in the process. Maroney's men show up to see the slaughter. They find Cobblepot in the walk in freezer clutching a big bag of money. He claims to have saved it from the gunmen, whom he can't identify since they wore masks.

Later that night Barbara confronts Jim and asks who Cobblepot is. He says he can't tell her. She wonders if he can't or he won't. She is annoyed that he's keeping secrets. He says he shared previous work secrets and it was a mistake. She finally comes clean about having had a year-long relationship--which she ended-- with Montoya which is how she found out the name. He is annoyed, not because she was a woman, but because she lied to him. She agrees she should've told him.

Maroney is steaming in Bamonte's and says he wants to hit Falcone back and make it hurt. Cobblepot eavesdrops. Maroney calls him out and thanks him for saving the money. He also gives him an upgrade from dishwasher to manager since ""the position recently became available."". Maroney asks his henchman to give him money to buy a suit.

Harvey reports that the real Gladwell is dead and the hitman was using his identity so they have nothing but a face. Jim pores over the CLM paper. Harvey says it's a waste of time. Jim says it's their only lead. Harvey says he's going to run down a different lead. Jim tells him to tell Fish he said hello.

Fish is auditioning another singer. She's singing a very slow sad song with marginal skill. She offers the same approach to this girl, who is named Liza, and tells her that even though she likes boys she wants Liza to seduce. Liza comes over and gives her a sexy smooch right on the mouth. She then finishes Fish's drink. Fish is impressed.

Harvey shows up and asks about Gladwell. Fish asks what's in it for her. He says he'll owe her one. She says it doesn't matter since the violence will continue via Falcone. And she says he has to get his way because if he loses even a small piece of Arkham it will prove he is getting old and weak. He thinks it's odd that she seems happy about this since if Falcone goes down that she will too. She says she always has a plan B and motions to young Liza.

Cobblepot calls Jim and tells him that Falcone has ordered another hit that will happen tonight. Jim says all the councilmen and mayor are being protected by police. Cobblepot says there are ways around police. Jim asks for a list of cops guarding the remaining council members and the mayor and sees the ones covering the mayor are named Campos, Lazenby, and Marcus: CLM. He heads over to the mayor's house to save him. The assassin enters shortly thereafter. They tussle. Harvey arrives and shoots the assassin.

Barbara comes to the precinct house and confronts Jim yet again about Cobblepot. He won't budge. She says she can't live like this, he either comes clean or he loses her. He says nothing. She walks away.

Fish brings the two female singers to a remote location. She says she can only hire one of them and can't decide so she wants them to fight it out. The less gifted singer but better seducer Liza kicks the other girl's ass. Bloodied and battered, she asks Fish when she starts.

The masked gunmen who busted Bamonte's are counting their money when Cobblepot arrives. Turns out he hired them to stage the heist. He offers them cannoli. Of course, the cannoli is poisoned. He kills his accomplices and takes the money.

The results of the Arkham vote are in: The mayor has decided to split the difference. The Arkham district will be developed into both low-cost housing as well as a waste management facility, angering Jim and Bruce Wayne, pleasing Maroney, and delivering what Fish calls ""a shot to the body"" to Falcone. Instead of a brand new facility Arkham Asylum will be retrofitted and reopened. Bruce knows this compromise is not best for Gotham but Jim explains that it helped quell the war: Maroney gets his waste management facility and the contract to refurbish Arkham and Falcone gets the contract to build the low income housing. Bruce is beside himself saying his everything his parents worked for are falling into the hands of criminals. Jim says not everything since Bruce is still alive and they're still in the fight. Bruce wonders if Gotham can be saved. Jim says it's worth trying."

Bruce is constructing an evidence wall. Alfred offers a walk, but Bruce is intent on constructing his wall to help find his parents killers. Alfred wonders what will happen if he never gets revenge. Bruce says he doesn't want revenge, he wants to figure out how Gotham works and, in that regard, Wayne Enterprises. Alfred still worries it's an unhealthy habit. But Bruce isn't listening.

Maroni says he wanted a piece of Arkham, he strong-armed Falcone and got it so he wants to know why he can't have a piece of the casino. His adviser Frankie thinks it's a bad idea to anger Falcone more, but Maroni wants it done anyway. Frankie says he will make it happen.

A busker plays his guitar on the street. A man approaches him, all squirrelly-like and puts a vial of something in is guitar case, a green liquid. The busker picks it up, it says ""breathe me"" it, so he does. His immediate reaction is breathlessness and weird twitching. He walks into a bodega and begins drinking milk directly from the jug. The clerk yellls at him. The busker says ""do not vex me your mortal"" and keeps drinking. The clerk approaches with a bat and the busker breaks it in half.

Bullock and Gordon are eating burgers from a food truck. Selina Kyle is nearby and pickpockets a man. Jim spots her and gives chase but she's too fast. They're right by the bodega and walk in and see the aftermath of clerk's confrontation with the busker. The clerk explains the guy took his ATM machine and about the ""don't vex me"" line. He explains the guy stole the ATM with his bare hands with no vehicle.

Fish enjoys the singing of her new protege in the bar. She's bored of the bar. Fish smacks her face and asks why she's there with her. She says she's her secret weapon. She said learning this song was her job and to not cal her mama, she has to earn that. She turns the song again and has her practice.

Harvey and Jim go to the Captain who sees footage of the guy running away with the ATM. They show her the vile and say Nygma is working o ID-ing the drug.

Fish and other Falcone lieutenants meet with Falcone and says they shouldn't worry about Maroni and they should not push back on him and that Falcone can still control Maroni. One of the underlings, Niko, is not happy but Fish sides with Falcone and him playing Maroni on a ""long line."" Fish gets up in the chauvinist guy's face until Falcone shuts them down saying they need each other and are family.

Harvey and Jim hit the streets to run down the busker. They finaly find someone who knows him, a hooker. She gives them a locale to find him and it's littered with gallon milk containers. He asks for help and says he needs more of the drug and he doesn't feel good. He says a man with a mangled ear gave it to him. The guy is agitated and strong enough to throw them both off. He picks up the ATV but then loses his super strength and it falls on him, killing him. ""God help us if that drug gets out,"" says Jim.

Cut to the man with the mangled ear handing out vials of the drug, freely on the street including to the hooker they just talked to.

Alfred finds a strung out Bruce asleep surrounded by the files. He threatens to throw them in the fire. Bruce protests. He then tells Bruce he's accepted an invitation to a charity event being thrown by Wayne Enterprises on his behalf. He's glad because he has questions about corruption in the city. He's done a lot of sleuthing about shell corporations and the like. Bruce asks if his parents were corrupt. Alfred says no.

Bruce turns on a news report about the rampant chaos being caused by ""Viper"" the new drug that causes euphoria, super strength, and then death.

We cut to the precinct, which is overrun by Viper victims tearing stuff up. Nygma explains to Harvey, Jim, and the Captain how Viper works: it unlocks unused DNA and burns calcium to create the effects so the victims try to eat milk and cheese to replace the calcium, eventually their bones crumble and they suffocate. Nygma is clearly excited by the new drug. The captain wonders who is putting it out there. Harvey likes the idea of just giving it to all the scumbags and keeping the good people inside.

They start the investigation at the city's most state-of-the-art laboratory, Wellzyne, a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.

Maroni continues to tell Frankie that he wants the casino ""taken."" Oswald interjects with his idea to help, he knows a janitor that works in the casino and that can give him access. Frankie is nervous that this is just a dishwasher in a suit. Maroni thinks he's a player acting humble, Penguin admits that this isn't his first rodeo. He tells his story about having previously worked for Fish and then almost getting killed which he thinks Maroni will find funny and helpful. Maroni bangs his head into the table and says it is a funny story.

The a female lawyer from Wellzyne come to the crazy precinct and says they have no connection to the drug. They mention the man with the mangled ear. He was a Wellzyne employee, a biochemist. She says he was disgruntled working on shampoo and toothpaste and he tried to cut off his own ear during a disagreement with his supervisor. She says he then disappeared. Jim thinks the woman knew and that's why she came to them before the cops could come to them. She says she didn't and they can go through all of their lab stuff Harvey puts out an APB on Stan, the biochemist.

Frankie comes to the precinct and tells Jim he has to come with him and explains that he has met Oswald and that if he doesn't come with them, Maroni is going to send Oswald's head in a bag to Falcone which could be embarrassing for Jim. Jim goes with him. They get in a car and another guy puts a bag over his head.

Jim meets over a meal with Maroni. Oswald is bloodied at his side. He tells Jim Oswald's story. He yells every time Oswald talks. He asks Jim to tell him the same exact story Penguin told him or else they will both die. Jim tells the story starting with the Wayne murder. He tells the truth. Maroni can't believe no one knows that Penguin is alive. Jim says if they did he would be dead. Maroni thanks him for telling the truth. He gives Penguin a smooch and says they have a brand new gift, a snitch from the Falcone camp, he says it's Christmas. Maroni thanks Jim and says he will call him if he needs him. Penguin mouths ""thank you"" to Jim. Jim leaves.

Fish is teaching her protegee to say ""I love you, baby"" without seeming sexy for some reason. And then ""oh, honey"" as if she's caught her in a lie. She's a good study.

Jim heads back to the precinct, Bullock shares Stan's files which aren't very good leads. Bullock asks where he was. Jim says personal stuff. Bullock figures Barbara and Jim agrees. Jim finds a photo of Stan with a professor at Gotham University and go to see him. Stan was a student of his. The prof says Stan didn't work on shampoo at Wellzyne, Stan designed pharmaceutical weapons for combat troops, like one that could help soldiers tear opponents with their bare hands. He says Viper was the first go around and it caused death. The second was called Venom and didn't have that unfortunate side effect. But he didn't want it to go forward and went to the Wayne's to intervene. They did. And then they were killed and Wellzyne revived the project which drove Stan to take his ""radical"" measures. The professor isn't outraged at what Stan did and it turns out that the professor was helping him. He says Stan will be making a statement. He then inhales some Venom and attacks Harvey. Jim shoots the old guy but he first tells them that Stan is going to attack Wellzyne and Wayne enterprises. Jim figures out that it's the charity event that Bruce is attending.

We cut to Bruce and Alfred arriving at the event and then Stan preparing his attack on the party as a cater waiter.

Alfred points out various people at the party as Stan plans to unleash Venom into the air ducts.

Bruce sits with a middle manager from Wayne Enterprises. He wonders where the board members are. She says they're too busy to attend events like this because they're helping to keep Wayne Enterprises in the black. He says he wanted to ask about irregularities in the Arkham project. She's confused. She says she can assure him that Wayne Enterprises wouldn't countenance working with criminals. He says he believes her but still wants to meet with the board. She says she can try and make that happen. They are interrupted by Stan on a video screen threatening them with imminent death. He explains how he made the drug for Wellzyne and WE. Bruce asks if this is true. The woman say it's not. The stuff comes through the vents and everyone runs when they see the green gas. Jim finds Stan and tells him to turn it off or he'll shoot. Stan say it's okay, his work is done. Jim shoots the container and Stan inhales a blast. Bullock shows up, Jim tells him not to shoot. Stan tells them he's leaving and to go look at warehouse 39. The drug takes hold and Stan jumps off he roof.

Jim goes to investigate Warehouse 39 which is owned by Wellzyne. It is an empty laboratory. Jim is disappointed. Harvey says, ""What'd you expect? It's Gotham.""

The WE exec that Bruce talked to is in a car watching them. She tells someone on the phone that they might as well leave the cops be because they didn't find anything. She says they'll review their methods if the cops get closer.

Back at Wayne Manor, Bruce is examining the woman's Wellzyne personnel records and taking notes. Alfred enters and sits and looks through files, clearly now on board with helping him. Bruce smiles.

Penguin, Maroni, and Frankie sit in a car outside the casino waiting for the heist to be pulled off. Maroni asks if Penguin is nervous. He says it's okay because if this doesn't work out he will be killing him. Penguin admits to a case of the jitters. The heist is complete. Maroni is thrilled. Penguin lives.

It looks like that fight between Fish and Niko was staged because we cut to them in bed, very cozy, her having tied him up. She bites him, he likes it. He wonders that sometimes she really doesn't like him. She says this is untrue and they need to keep up a front for Falcone because he can't find out that they are working together. Niko says the old man has to go soon. Fish agrees.

We cut to Falcone feeding the birds on some steps as Fish's proteges wanders by humming the song she taught her. Falcone hears her humming and says it's his favorite aria. She says it's hers too. He says his mother used to sing it to him and he hadn't heard it in a while. He is about to say she looks like her but stops. She offers him one of her earbuds and they listen to it together. Fish's secret weapon is now being deployed."

We open on Gotham City 10 years ago and a crazy bald man is addressing himself in the mirror saying ""I am the spirit of the Goat.' He puts on a gimp mask, grabs a hammer, and smashes a mirror.

We cut to a young woman in a fancy party dress on a balcony with a news report on ""The Spirit of the Goat"" serial killer playing in the background. Gimpy Goat Man grabs her from behind.

Bullock and his former partner Dix roll up to a dilapidated building. Dix calls in back up and tells a hotshot Harvey to wait for back-up. Harvey doesn't care and wants to go in. Dix says Gotham's golden rule is ""No heroes."" Harvey runs in anyway wanting to save the girl. It is an old theatre. His partner joins him and says she's already dead. Harvey says he doesn't know that. They see the girl tied to some kind of altar surrounded by newly lit candles. They hear a noise. Gimpy Goat Man is under the altar. Harvey yells out to him and calls him by his name Randall. The guy says Randall is dead and there is only the Goat man. He pulls a cord on the altar and Dix falls under the stage. The Goat Man proclaims he will always come back. Harvey says ""Come back from this!"" and shoots him. He unmasks him and it is Randall. Alas, Dix is unconscious.

We cut to present day and Harvey is upset to see a woman tied to a similar altar, this time outside by a river. Nygma is bothering him with another riddle and Harvey isn't having it. The woman is dead, she is the oldest child of a moneyed family, same MO of the Goat. Harvey thinks they have a copycat. He's agitated ince he's already solved the case. He wonders where Gordon is.

Jim isn't answering his phone because he's arguing with Barbara about his secrets and that it has to be this way. He broods that he came here to be a cop and the city needs so much more. She demands that he give her half of what he carries. He says it's dangerous. She reiterates her demand saying he has to let her in and then they will be okay. His phone rings insistently. He says he will tell her everything he can and make it right. They kiss, he leaves.

Montoya and Allen are canvassing the waterfront for a lead on the Cobblepot shooting. A homeless man IDs Gordon as the shooter. Montoya thinks they have him now.

Gordon shows up at the murder scene and Harvey gives him a hard time and explains about the deja vu murders. He's angry. They decide to go see the dead girl's-- Amanda-- family. He tells Nygma to be on the lookout for clue.

The wealthy parents are bereft and say everyone loved Amanda. He's twitchy though and they wonder what that's about. Their family therapist says Mr. Hastings has a delicate nature and can't deal with this kind of tragedy. Harvey says no one is.

Nygma goes to the Records Annex and chats with the prim Miss Kringle about the old files on the Goat murders. She is clearly creeped out by him. He says he would like her parents since they named her Kristin Kringle. He calls the records a shambles, she says she has everything just as she wants it. He says he can help her. She says she doubts it. She leaves and he looks at the files and says there is a better way to do it.

Harvey and Jim poke around the Hastings mansion. They decide to run down employees who had keys to the building. They head over to the autopsy.

Oswald goes to see his mother, crazy Carol Kane. She doesn't seem surprised he's alive, she's just mad he hasn't called and assumes there was a hussy. He says he doesn't even date. He says there was only betrayal and savagery and that he was nearly killed. She comforts him and says the bullies simply resent him and are envious. He tells her that he is going to be somebody in this town. She says she always knew this.

At the autopsy Harvey alerts the M.E. to a trademark of the Goat, who sewed an 1813 penny into his victim's necks. Harvey says no one could know this detail and so it can't be a copycat, it's actually Randall. (Well, he did say he always comes back.)

Jim and Harvey report into the Captain. They wonder how the new killer knew about the penny since only he and the M.E. knew about this detail and the M.E. is dead. The Captain tells him to go talk to Dix since he knew too. Harvey seems reluctant to talk to his old partner.

Bruce does his thing in the study while Alfred watches a news report about ""The Goat Watch"" who is killing the oldest child of wealthy Gotham families, who are scattering out of town. Alfred points out that Bruce is probably a target and thinks he should leave town for a bit. Bruce says he's not running, he has work to do. He also points out that the Goat doesn't have anyone to take Bruce ""from.""

Kris Kringle returns to records, aghast that Nygma has reorganized her files against her wishes. She is livid and thinks he wants her to quit and take her job. He says he wants her... to keep her job and have it here...for working. He realizes what he did was ""inappropriate"" and she calls him ""odd."" He clearly likes her and she clearly hates him.

Harvey and Jim go to see Dix in a hospital. Dix is wheelchair-bound playing solitaire. He razzes Harvey about ""No heroes."" Bullock brings up the case and asks about the pennies. Dix says he didn't tell anybody about the pennies. Dix says they were wrong about Randall, he wasn't working alone. This isn't a copycat or a lone killer,it's a conspiracy says Dix. Harvey thinks he's wrong and stalks off. Dix and Gordon commiserate about how Harvey is a pain in the ass. Dix tells Jim to wary about Harvey since he thinks he's a white knight. Jim is confused by this. Jim walks out and overhears that Harvey is paying Dix's medical bills and sending him magazines. They leave.

A rich young woman is packing a bag with help from her maid, until Gimpy Goat Man 2.0 attacks the maid and abducts the girl.

Harvey gets the word and alerts Jim. Harvey's out at the house and Jim at the precinct. Harvey thinks have about 8 hours. Jim goes over the employee list and Harvey tells him to enlist Nygma to run it down.

Barbara goes to see Montoya and tells her to keep an open mind about Jim and she will help her and tell her what she can. Montoya yells at her and warns her off and says who Jim knows will kill Barbara. Montoya says they got a warrant for his arrest and tells her to get out of town when he's arrested.

Nygma and Jim finger a suspect who squats near a place where they found the girl in the opening interlude and got Randall. Harvey thinks that has to be it. They go in to the theatre and Goat Man is in there about to kill the girl. It is an identical scene as Jim and Harvey enter. JIm goes up on the altar, Harvey spies Goat Man in the balcony. Jim cuts the girl down and she is okay.

The Goat Man attacks Harvey and they strugglge and Harvey falls down the stairs. The Goat Man reiterates he will always come back. They struggle again and fall down more stairs. He's about to hatchet Harvey when Jim takes him down. Harvey is grateful.

Selina Kyle breaks into Wayne Manor and approaches a sleeping Bruce who does not stir. She walks around the study and sees his evidence wall related o his parents murder and info about the Mayor, Maroni, and Falcone. She grabs an engraved case from the desk and smiles at Bruce. She hears approaching steps and climbs back out the window.

Oswald is taking a bath at Mom's house. She has pressed his suit. She starts to give him a sponge bath and asks if he's doing anything illegal. He says he's just doing business. She tells him to remember to trust no one but your mother. He says he knows. But, he says he thinks he's finally found someone to trust: Jim Gordon and he will help it all come out alright in the end.

Jim and Harvey bring Goat Man 2.0 in, his name is Raymond and is linked to both victims and has a history of mental illness. The captain congratulates them and tells Harvey to look happier about getting the guy. It doesn't smell right to Harvey even though details line up. He says it's weird and it's like something found them and changed them and wonders how he knew about the coin. He thinks they're missing something and if they don't find it they'll keep missing it. Jim says they should go over the files. Harvey tells him to get some rest. Jim leaves and Harvey keeps watching Ray who is getting very twitchy just like Mr. Hastings did. Harvey has an epiphany.

Jim heads home and Barbara tells him Montoya has a witness and they have a warrant. She asks what he isn't telling her. She has packed bags and tells him to come with her now, it won't matter as long as they're together. He says he can't run. There is a knock at the door. It's Montoya and Allen who arrest him for killing Cobblepot.

Harvey goes to see Mr. Hastings and talks with his therapist, who is a hypnotherapist it turns out. She is with Hastings but Harvey says he wants to talk to her. She does pro bono work and one of her patients is Raymond, Goat Man 2.0. She trained the killers under hypnotism to replace their compulsive behaviors with fist clenching. He thinks she is behind the murders, and she ""imbued"" them with the ""Spirit of the Goat.' She is impressed with his detective work. He asks her why, she says he wouldn't understand and calls it an act of therapy for Gotham, negative reinforcement against rich people by killing their kids. She says she can't hypnotize to do something they don't already want to do and we all want to hurt the rich. Hastings comes out and asks if she's okay. Harvey tries to arrest her and she says the magic words and tells Hastings to kill Harvey and he attacks him. Harvey fights him off and shoots her.

The Captain is confused by Harvey's story and is even more confused when Montoya and Allen bring Jim in. Harvey tries to cover for him and Jim keeps trying to convey to him that he didn't actually shoot Cobblepot. They then arrest Harvey. And then, Oswald Cobblepot walks in and announces himself.. Montoya and Allen are gobsmacked and Harvey is furious at Jim. Luckily, they are both handcuffed."

Penguin takes a walk down the street, protected by two of Maroni's big thugs.

Fish is, to put it mildly that Penguin is alive. She instructs Butch to go pick up Jim Gordon to answer for not killing him as instructed.

Jim has more immediate problems in the form of Harvey who has a gun on him at the precinct. He says he'll have to kill Jim and take his body back to Falcone and beg him for mercy. Jim asks him not to kill him but to help him. Jim gets the upper hand and Harvey says Jim better hope he doesn't see him again.

As Barbara's phone rings on the coffee table, Jim telling her to get out of town, Butch is being creepy with her in their living room, sniffing her hair and telling her that Jim is lucky to have her. He asks if she's ever been with a criminal since that turns some women on. He says Jim is in serious hot water. Jim enters gun drawn. Butch says he needs to come with him. Jim demurs. Butch says now they have to kill Barbara too. He shoots Butch's minion and knocks Butch out and he and Barbara take off. He puts her on a bus saying knowing she's safe will help him do what he needs to do and he will join her. She asks what happens if he doesn't. He tells her not to come back to Gotham.

Jim's big plan, as he tells the Captain, is to arrest Falcone and the Mayor on charges related to the Wayne murders. The Captain does not like this plan and says she wants to change things too but this isn't going to work and no one will help him. Not even her.

Fish goes to Falcone with blood in her eyes for Penguin, Jim,and Harvey. Falcone wonders why Penguin matters so much to her. She says he knows too much. He doesn't want to start a war and tells her to go ask Maroni, nicely, to have Penguin back and to send Victor to get Jim.

As she and Niko leave Fish is nervous that Falcone is too calm and the girl isn't doing her job. Falcone hasn't touched her, he just likes to watch her cook and clean. She thinks Falcone is acting like he knows something.

Victor, and two female minions, arrive at the precinct, during Jim's pow wow with the Captain. Victor, a tall scary bald guy, basically shoos all the police out of the room. Only the Captain stays but Jim shoos her out as well. Victor explains it would be easier if Jim just came without fuss since he's been instructed to bring him alive, noting that a man without hands is still technically alive. Jim isn't playing. A firefight between the Falcone trio and Jim ensues in the precinct house. Victor lands one shot in Jim's gut and he runs. He hides behind cars in the parking lot. A cop who didn't know what was going on comes out and draws her gun and Victor shoots her. Jim makes a break for it but Victor shoots him again. Just then Montoya and Allen screech up and save the day whisking Jim away. Victor goes and finishes off the female cop and carves the, shudder, 28th kill hashtag in his arm.

Fish tries to play nice but Maroni refuses and wonders why Penguin is so important. She says he isn't, and that this is about respect. Maroni, instead, has Penguin just offer a sincere apology. He does. Fish is not satisfied and says this means war. As she gets up to leave Penguin addresses her as Fish and she slaps him hard and grabs his face digging her nails into it and says only her friends are allowed to cal her Fish.

Jim wakes up in a make-shift hospital at the university dissection lab. His ""doctor,"" a friend of Montoya and Allen's extracted the two bullets and says he was lucky no major arteries were hit. She says he needs to rest for a week but he's raring to go. Allen comes in and says before he heads out Jim might want to put some clothes on.

Falcone's guys abduct some nuns, chain them together, and then string them out across a bridge just as Maron's men are making a gun delivery. The driver stops just before crashing into the nuns. Butch tells Maroni's men that none of his deliveries will get across the bridge until they get Penguin back and then he shoots Maroni's men in the legs to send a message that they're serious.

Maroni is angry that Falcone found out about the gun truck. Even though Maroni's right hand man is clearly skeptical about Penguin, Maroni thinks that if Fish wants him so bad he must be a golden goose. Penguin honks. Maroni wants to hit them where it hurts. Penguin says he knows where to hit Falcone next. The right hand man is unhappy.

Montoya, in the driver's seat, and Jim in the back seat have a heart to heart in the car in the woods. Montoya apologizes to Jim for misjudging him and they shake. He assures Montoya that Barbara is safe. Suddenly Montoya's face appears at Jim's window with Alfred with a knife to his neck. Jim vouches for him and Alfred apologizes and they shake. Jim, Montoya, and Allen come to Bruce and Alfred in the library. Jim explains he's in a tight spot with some powerful people and he may not be able to keep his promise about finding his parent's killers. Bruce is upset and asks him not to speak to him like a child since he's clearly expecting to die and Bruce wants to know why. Jim explains a little bit and that it's connected to his parents murders and if anything happens to him Montoya and Allen will keep his promise and he trusts them completely. Alfred offers to help but Jim says he has to go it alone now. He offers Bruce his hand and Bruce hugs him.

Penguin leads Maroni's men to a clandesting meeting of Falcone's men in a warehouse. Maroni's right handman puts a bomb on the door and they walk in firing. Penguin enters to see the massacre--which includes Niko-- and says he told 'em and there must be a million dollars there. Right hand man says he's clever. Penguin says he thinks he's being sarcastic. Right hand man says he is and that Penguin is a snitch and roughs him up and says he may have Maroni may be fooled but he's not and that he could kill him now and blame it on someone else. Penguin says that is clever but he is even cleverer. He notes that Right Hand Man's greatest passion is money and so his problem is he's a cheapskate. Suddenly Maroni's other men seize him and Penguin points out there is no loyalty among thieves and stabs him and says a simple offer of substantial payment was all it took to sway these men to Penguin's side and he finishes Right Hand Man off. He strokes his head and then kisses it.

Maroni and Falcone have a meeting across the river. They embrace. Falcone says he wants the violence to stop and that they have both lost precious family members. Fish glowers at Penguin over Maroni's shoulder. Falcone says business is good for both of them and why risk a war over trifles. He says they will let him have Penguin unharmed as a gift, he asks for a gift in return. Penguin whispers in his ear, and Maroni says he'll give him Indian Hill. Fish says it's a toxic waste dump on an Indian burial ground and is worthless. Falcone says nothing is worthless and they'll take it. Maroni asks about Jim. Falcone says they're working on it. Maroni wishes him luck since there's nothing more dangerous than an honest man.

Jim is at home gearing up the arsenal. A drunk Harvey shows up with a hooker. He says he's not going to kill him and that since Jim has the moral high ground and Harvey is doomed anyway he's going to back Jim's play. He asks what that is. He tells him about planning to arrest Falcone and the mayor for framing Mario Pepper for the Wayne murders. Harvey thinks this is crazy and they'll be dead in the street a few minutes later. Jim says at least the people will know the truth then. Harvey says he's in and goes off to have sex with his girl.

The next morning Jim joins the Mayor in his limo with a big gun and Harvey as the driver and arrests him.

The limo heads off next to Falcone's place. They enter as Falcone is having breakfast. Jim arrests him while Harvey takes care of some minions. Falcone says they won't make it to the end of the driveway. Falcone says it must be nice to have nothing to lose. But, he says, he does have something to lose: Barbara came back to plead for Jim's life and he has a knife to Barbara's throat right now. Jim doesn't believe him. Falcone is pretty persuasive and wants Jim to believe him. Harvey sees him wavering and says Falcone is lying. Falcone says he is many things but not a liar. They bring Barbara out to the living room where Jim has folded his play. Falcone wondes what he's going to do with Jim and says by rights he needs to die. The mayor excuses himself. Falcone says it's a shame since Gotham needs men like them, morally right men, because Gotham's worst fear isn't the system but anarchy. He says Jim believing him is a step in the right direction and decides to let all three of them go. Jim asks him what the catch is. Falcone says the catch is Jim has to think about what he said about anarchy and that one day he will agree he is right.

At home Barbara apologizes and says she was trying to help and she loves him so much. They kiss.

Back at Falcone's he eats some muffins his ""girl"" has made for them and declares them delicious. He goes to see feed the chickens. Penguin approaches and Falcone calls him friend and they embrace. Falcone says he was just thinking about the night they met.

We flash back to the pilot and Jim and Harvey strung up. Falcone went to meet the snitching Penguin and said dead men tend to be honest and asked if he had anything to tell him before he killed him. Penguin said he had a great secret to tell and a final request. He asked to have Jim Gordon assigned the job of killing him because he knew he couldn't go through with it. He said he would come back to Gotham under another name, work his way into the Maroni family, and become Falcone's snitch. Falcone liked this plan and said it was a deal. The secret? He told him that Fish and Niko were lovers and that Fish was pushing to have Niko take Falcone's place only to push him out for herself. We flash back to the chicken coop. Falcone says he's amazed that everything that played out just like the Penguin said but he's troubled by the plan to let Gordon live. Penguin thanks him for the favor of sparing Jim and says he knows that, one way or the other, Jim will ""see the light."""

For reasons that will become clear later, a man is roaming an abandoned and trashed office space. He encounters another man and the pair fight, ultimately to the death, using various office supplies as weapons. The victor raises his hands towards a camera in the ceiling where someone is watching on a screen.

The next morning the dead man is found far from the scene. They notice ink and paint on the man's clothes, which peg the guy as probably working in finance. They decide to canvas the area and Nygma asks if he should run prints. He asks if he wants to run them all, including the thumb he finds in the dead man's mouth.

The Penguin encounters a wealthy woman on the street and steals her brooch, saying a friend he has would love it.

The Penguin presents the brooch to Fish when they have a sitdown. He hopes they can be friends. Maroni wants to clarify terms and he sent Penguin which burns Fish up. She says he has his businesses- drugs, the unions-- will continue to pay tariffs on the ports, Arkham is still split 50/50 and if he needs favors from the mayor or the cops he has to ask Falcone. Penguin says there is to be no blood spilled, not a drop. Fish says, maybe a drop. She tells her right hand man Timothy that Penguin used to have his job. Penguin says things change. She opens his gift, extracts the letter opener from the brooch and promptly stabs Penguin in the hand with it. She tells him he betrayed her and when she orders people dead, she wants them to stay dead. She tells him to watch his back, since things do in fact change, and that he should pray for Falcone's good health. Penguin says he does.

At the precinct Jim speaks to the victim's mother, who said he worked in a coffee shop but was trying to break into finance.

While Gordon talks to her, Harvey and the captain talk about how angry Gordon is since all the cops ran out on him, and how they treat him like crap now because seeing him makes them know what cowards they are. The Captain says Gordon is lucky to have Harvey.

Penguin re-gifts the brooch to his bat-guano crazy mother, who notices his hurt hand. He says his enemies are jealous. She tells a story of a mean girl in school who she ratted out to the secret police. She notes that everyone has secrets. This gives the Penguin an idea.

Gordon and Bullock go to see a black market doctor who specializes in helping criminals. He admits a guy who had his thumb chomped off did come to see him that morning, and he dropped a business card of a financial firm that fell out of the guy's pocket. Gordon brings in the doctor over Harvey's objections.

When they bring him in, other cops voice their objections since this doctor is a good confidential informant for them. Harvey tries to persuade Jim to let him go, noting he was there for him with Falcone and he has to go along to get along, and that Harvey is on his side. Jim still says no, and the doctor stays locked up. Jim reiterates his dedication to cleaning up the city and the department at all costs.

Jim comes home to a drunk Barbara wielding his gun. She is clearly on edge since the run in with Victor Zaz and Falcone. He admonishes her for handling a gun while drunk and tries to reassure her that things will be okay.

A man in a mask at the abandoned office space approaches three men in cages. One asks when they will get out. The man says that is up to them.

The next morning Barbara apologizes to Jim about last night as he is taking his extra gun. She says it was just nerves and to leave the gun. He puts it back in the box and locks it up, and gives her the key. He says he wishes it wasn't like this. ""Do you really?"" she asks, and then immediately takes it back and tells him to go and catch some bad guys.

Nygma is conducting his own unauthorized autopsy on the dead guy. He seems to have hit on something when the coroner enters and angrily shoos him out. It's clearly not the first time he's done this.

Liza meets Fish at confession and says she hasn't learned anything interesting from Falcone. She cooks, cleans, and sings for him and they go on walks. Fish instructs her to drug Falcone and get a copy of the last two pages of a ledger in his office drawer. She wonders if the drug will kill him. Fish says no, but is worried Liza has caught feelings for Falcone. She says she hasn't. Fish says she doesn't want to kill him yet, just siphon his power. Liza wonders what happens if one of Falcone's men catches her. Fish notes she will probably be dead then.

Gordon and Harvey go to the office on the card and see that many of the workers are bruised and injured. They meet the boss, Richard Sionis, whose office is littered with swords, masks, and other artifacts of war. Jim can tell he's responsible for what's going on. Richard tells him to prove it. They ask about the memorabilia. Sionis says business is war. Gordon says no, war is war. Sionis can tell that Gordon was in a war and really killed people, and says he must miss the battlefield. They don't have anything on him so they have to leave. As they do, Jim notices a trail of blood going into the bathroom and bumps into the one-thumbed guy. They tussle, the man is only knocked out when Bullock opens the door into the guy's head.

The Penguin kidnaps Fish's right hand man Timothy and squeezes him for Fish's secrets. He finally spills that he overheard that Fish has someone close to Falcone. He doesn't know who. Penguin has one of his guys kill him, telling him the body can't be found.

The guy flips on Sionis and says when people apply for a job at the firm the top three are brought to the abandoned office and told to fight and the last man standing gets the job. (He is clearly breaking the first rule of fight club.) Nygma says four more people were killed with office supplies in the last few years. Then the man's lawyer shows up before they can get him to sign a statement so they need to figure out where the fights are being staged.

The Captain is freaked out and wonders what has happened to Gotham. He says the turning point into chaos was the Wayne murder, since they represented something decent and hopeful. The Captain apologizes for not staying with Jim when Zaz showed up.

Harvey gets a list of properties owned by Sionis and they split the list to start looking. Harvey says Sionis has Jim's number, that there is a demon in him, that he likes to fight. Barbara calls to check in and Jim basically hangs up on her.

Liza makes the tea for Falcone and puts in the drug. She goes to Fish's and hands over the copied ledger pages while an older black woman sings onstage. Liza says she wants out. Fish says that's not possible. Liza wonders what Fish's beef is since she is rich and powerful. She wonders why she is bothering. Fish spins a yarn in which as a poor child she would often hear her prostitute mother entertain men on the other side of a curtain in their small apartment. One night, one of Falcone's men killed her. Fish stayed silent the whole night, two feet from her dead mother. She vowed to never let herself be powerless again or let any man be over her. Liza is duly moved by this story. Later, the older black woman comes to sit by Fish at the bar and says she overheard her ""telling stories."" Clearly, Fish was lying and this woman is her mother. Fish shrugs and says a lie with a heart of truth is a powerful thing.

Jim finds the office and is promptly tasered by Sionis. He wakes up to hear Sionis telling the three others that instead of killing each other, their task is to kill Gordon. Gordon tries to persuade them to stand down since he's a cop. Sionis throws in a million dollar signing bonus. Gordon knows his goose is cooked. Except, of course, it's not -- because he's Jim Gordon. He takes on all three men and more or less handily dispatches them, while a crowd of people in another location watch the brawl on camera.

When Harvey hasn't heard back from Jim, he starts to get worried. He asks the other cops to help him look into the addresses that were on Jim's half of the list since he might be in trouble. He gets no takers. Bullock makes an impassioned speech to the precinct house, saying he knows that Gordon can be an asshat but he is still a cop and not one of them stood up when he needed it the first time and he won't let that happen again. The captain steps up as do several others.

Not that it matters, because Jim has taken care of the three men by himself -- and Sionis to boot when he attacks him. Jim gets the upper hand and is poised above Sionis with his sword but simply drops it. The Captain shows up, gun drawn, and just as Sionis is about to attack from behind, Jim turns and decks him. She is impressed. He thanks her for showing up.

Meanwhile, while all of this has been going on, Alfred has forced Bruce to go back to school where he is promptly pitied by the cute girls and bullied by the awful boys. When one of the boys goes too far and makes a disrespectful comment about Bruce's mother, Bruce slaps him. The bully, Tommy Elliott, and his friends, retaliate. When Bruce emerges roughed up, Alfred isn't having it. He gives Bruce his father's watch and drives Bruce to the bully's house, where Bruce unleashes a can of whup ass on him, using the watch to serve as brass knuckles. The rich brat Tommy complains to Alfred that Bruce tried to kill him. Alfred agrees, adding that Tommy should take note that Alfred did not try to stop Bruce. Later, Bruce tells Alfred that he is just so angry all the time, and asks Alfred if he can teach him how to fight. Alfred says he sure can.

At the precinct house Jim thanks Harvey for having his back and says he's wrong, it's not that he loves fighting but he's not afraid to. And if they don't, who will? He says he won't stop until he has the mayor, Falcone, and all the dirty cops. As Jim is finally leaving for the day, the case closed, he calls Barbara and tells her he's coming home and he loves her. We see her ignore the call and wheel a suitcase out the door, and a note addressed to Jim on the table.

Jim finally heads home after the events of last week, with Selina in tow, who is impressed by Barbara's house. Barbara, however, is not there. Selina goes to get food while Jim reads Barbara's note who apologizes for being fearful of Zaz and Falcone and says she had to go away for awhile to get her head together. Selina reads the note. Selina thinks she gets to stay there but Jim says he has another place in mind: Wayne Manor. But first he wants her to describe the perp to a sketch artist.

A group of prison guards are preparing to transport a ""genius bomb maker"" and being very careful with him. Not so careful that he doesn't palm some matches.

Jim shows Bruce the sketch from Selina's memory at Wayne Manor. Bruce doesn't recognize the man's face, which she said she saw. Bruce asks if Jim believes her. Jim says he does. Alfred is concerned Jim wants a ""common street criminal"" to stay there and indefinitely. Alfred says no, saying she's a witness to a murder. Bruce understands she's the best chance of finding his parents murderer and says she can stay as long as it takes. Jim tries to assuage Alfred's worries saying he's meeting with a trustworthy ADA. Alfred scoffs at the concept but says they will try to be nice to her.

Meanwhile, she's busy manhandling expensive artifacts in the house, when Bruce happens upon her. He introduces himself and shakes her hand. She says people call her Cat. They appraise one another, seemingly approvingly.

The master bomb maker fiddles with the matches in his hand and the guard takes off his cuffs and graps them.The transport is hit by an SUV with four gun-toting thugs. They take the bomb maker, named Ian Hargrove, from the transport van after killing the guards. They sound like they might be Russian?

We meet ADA Harvey Dent as he is dressing down a young kid for making some kind of criminal screw-up. He tells him he deserves a chance. So he says he's going to flip a coin: heads or tails, if he loses he goes to jail. But there's a catch that he has to promise God right now if he wins he'll get his life straight. The kid promise and guesses heads, he wins. (It's a JFK dollar for what it's worth.) He tells the kid to walk away as Montoya, Allen, and Jim. Jim asks what if the kid guessed wrong? Dent says teenagers nearly always guess heads and shows him it's a two-headed coin.

They go to Dent's office and show him the sketch. He says the witness is safe. And even though she may be useless in a courtroom right now, the idea of her, says Dent could be powerful. Dent shows Jim a slide of a powerful businessman named Lovecraft who had dealings with Falcone, Maroni, and the Waynes and who has made a boatload since their deaths. He's willing to bet his career Lovecraft was involved. (There's a great moment in this scene where one half of Dent's face is shadowed in the dark room and one half is lit by light from the window. Obvious and corny? Maybe, but also kinda cool.) He wants to use Selina to connect Lovecraft, even though she has no connection. He just wants to leak it and rattle some cages. Jim thinks Dent likes to bet a lot and doesn't want to endanger Selina, who he hasn't named. Montoya and Allen beseech him to trust Dent, saying he's one of them, someone who wants to clean up Gotham.

Jim heads out to the precinct house and he and Harvey caught the case of the kidnapped bomber Hargrove. They bring in his brother John. Harvey says he doesn't want to know where Jim was then asks if it's girl trouble. Jim says yes. Harvey says high society dames mess with your head.

Selina happens on Alfred teaching Bruce to fight. She notes in Gotham people don't fight with gloves on. He asks her how her room is. She says it will do. She says she's hungry. Alfred notes she slept through breakfast and will have to wait for lunch. Bruce offers to have Alfred make her tea and he declines saying it's not a hotel. She says she'll figure it out and walks off and Alfred instructs the ""cheeky little minx"" to mind her manners as well. Bruce tells him to be nice. Alfred says he didn't realize Bruce fancied her. Bruce blushes and says he doesn't. Alfred says it's nothing to be embarrassed about but to be careful since Cat seems like trouble.

Penguin heads to an apartment somewhere that has a picture of Liza and Falcone on the bookshelf. He goes around smelling her clothes and perfume. He scoots out right before she comes home and she notices someone has rooted around in her bag and been in her place. Penguin hobbles off before getting caught.

Jim and Harvey interrogate Hargrove's brother who hasn't heard fro him in years. The brother says his brother isn't a killer, he only blew up buildings that were munitions factories that made guns and bullets. The last bombing was the one that accidentally killed some janitors and he essentially gave himself up. He says his brother is not bad, he's mentally ill.

This conversation is cross cut with images of Ian making some kind of bomb in a picnic basket. Another man comes and fills the basket with treats, like a gift basket. This basket is delivered to the Gotham Munitions Factory. The guards rifle through it and itblows up and kills a whole bunch of them in the guard house. Ian watches from a nearby car with his captors.

Bruce asks Selina about living on the street. She doesn't like this line of questioning and wonders why he isn't in school. He says he's creating his own curriculum so he can focus on topics he likes. She wonders why a billionaire needs to learn anything. He thinks that's a strange attitude. She eats a croissant and he asks after her parents and if they're alive. She says sure. He wonders where? She gets angry and says she's not an orphan and storms out and bumps into Alfred.

The captain asks Gordon and Bullock about the prison escapee and the explosion. The captors got away with some serious, special explosives.

Alfred calls Jim to complain about Selina, calling her a tough nut. Jim asks him to hold on and he will be out to check on her when he can.

At Fish's Butch says everything is ready. She asks if he's nervous. He says he's fine. The Penguin returns and says he's trying to be friendly and takes a whiff of Fish, who smells just like Liza's perfume and names it out loud and then leaves. Butch correctly assesses him as creepy. Fish says to forget him, that he's nothing.

Harvey and Jim look over some files and he tells him that Barbara left and he doesn't know where. Bullock says it's a ploy to get him to set a date for a wedding. Nygma arrives and found something in the shrapnel from the bombing, a nameplate from an abandoned metal factory. They go to check it out.

They arrive and Hargrove is at a table working on a bomb. He raises his hands and says they have to help him and says they kidnapped him and threatened to kill his brother if he didn't help. He says the plan is to build a bomb aimed at Falcone. The Russian return and a shoot out ensues. The Russians grab Hargrove and abscond with him.

Back at Wayne Manor Selina tries to leave and Bruce says if she wants to go somewhere they can call her a taxi. She notes that he moves quietly, as does she. He asks if she's leaving. She says she's thinking about it. He apologizes for asking about her family. She says she wasn't upset. She looks at a picture of his mom and says she looks nice. Bruce asks about the night of the murder. He admits to feeling bad that he didn't do anything. She says he couldn't have done anything. She says her mom is in show business, sings and dances and does magic trick and makes millions but that's just a cover because she's actually a secret agent on a secret mission and when she's done she's coming back to get Selina. She asks if he's ever kissed a girl. He says no and asks why she asks. She says she's just curious. Alfred enters and says it's time for Bruce's studies and Selina is welcome to join. Selina passes.

The mayor comes to complain about Hargrove. Jim blames the mayor essentially for having a mentally ill man in a prison without facilities. The Mayor leaves. The Captain puts Hargrove's brother in protective custody.

Dent, flipping his coin, brings Lovecraft in and leaks the information about the eyewitness to the Wayne murder and he knows he's involved. Lovecraft says it's absurd. Dent tells him to think about his options because it's going to get ugly. Lovecraft says he has no idea who he is dealing with. Harvey freaks and grabs him by the lapel and screams he will rip him apart. He instantly becomes calm and says it was good to see Lovecraft.

With Hargrove gone they wonder who is planning this bombing to hurt Falcone. We cut to Fish talking with one the Russians, who used to work with her lover Niko. She says the best way to get back at Falcone for Niko's death is to hit him where it hurts, his money.

Bruce practices holding his breath in the pool. For some reason he does this fully clothed. Selina calls him the weirdest kid she's ever met. He says he's training. He says he's developing self-discipline and willpower. She says none of this will work on the streets of Gotham, strong isn't enough, he has to be mean and ruthless. She says he isn't and five minutes on the streets he will be mincemeat.

Nygma listens to a radio quiz show and works on some kind of bomb in the lab, which goes off and seems to make him happy. He takes his findings to Jim and Harvey. He says the stuff is for one use only, to penetrate iron. They figure the vaults at the Gotham Armory.

We cut to the basement of the Gotham Armory where the Russians have taken out Falcone's men and affixed a bomb to the iron door. Hargrove sets it off and the door falls open. Behind it is a wall of cash. Hargrove makes them promise no one else will get hurt.The head Russian Gregor says he promises.

Bullock, Gordon and a host of cops show up and surround the Russians and tell Hargrove his brother is safe. Hargrove walks toward Jim and Harvey. Suddenly a ringtone goes off and Jim realizes there's a bomb attached to the truck with the money. He tells everyone to get away and the bomb goes off, sending millions of flaming dollars flying. From a distance, a crouching Butch, putting away a phone sees this and walks away.

Later, Bruce and Selina eat and chat. She throws a bagel at him. She says she bets he can't hit her. He says he can. She says if he does, she'll let him kiss her. He tries valiantly to hit her. Whether they kiss or not they're having fun throwing food all around the library. At first Alfred is upset but sees Bruce is smiling and laughing and lets it go on. Jim calls and apologizes for not getting out there. Alfred now thinks Selina is a breath of fresh air.

Liza returns home and the Penguin is waiting for her. She says Falcone would kill him if he knew he was there. He says he wonders what Falcone would do if he knew Liza was spying on him for Fish. She says he has no proof. He says planting a seed of suspicion would be enough. Liza says he cares about her. Penguin goes to call him and she stops him. He rubs her arm and says her secret is safe with him because she's now going to turn double agent on Fish or she will die.

Dent goes to the precinct and says Lovecraft is scared and someone will start talking. Jim says they need to work together on it.

Bullock says Hargrove is on his way to Arkham, mayor is sending all the criminally ill patients to Arkham now, which, Jim points out, is in itself crazy. Hargrove also told Harvey that the bomb that blew up the truck wasn't his and they don't know whose it was.

Butch goes to see Fish who reports that the cops were everywhere and that all the Russians are dead. Fish is glad. She says she can't stand loose strings. He notes it's a helluva lot of money they just lost. She says the point wasn't to still the money but hurt Falcone. Butch says she did.

The Mayor gives a press conference about sending the criminally insane to the ancient Arkham Asylum.

Jim calls Barbara and says he got her letter and that she needed time away but he wants her to come back, he needs her and he has nothing without her and he loves her. We see her lying on a bed somewhere, presumably having listened to the message. Suddenly, we see Montoya rise up next to her in bed, and give her a kiss."

We open outside Wayne Manor and a garderner is telling a woman dressed all in black that she must be lost. She says she's right where she needs to be, then jumps and chokes him. Two men dressed similarly arrive and she instructs one to ""open him."" He slices him and she smears the gardener's blood on her head.

Meanwhile Selina and Bruce are practicing their balancing skills on a bannister. She offers to take him to a bridge in the city and try it there. She also tells him he needs to get over the murder of his parents. She offers to kiss him, but he declines, reasoning that he is not a suitable romantic partner, thus she must have an ulterior motive. She tells him, correctly, that he thinks too much and that she's trying to be nice. Bruce says he doesn't mean to offend but she doesn't strike him as nice. ""Screw you orphan,"" she says, telling him to climb the bridge on his own.

The bloody woman arrives pretending she was in a car accident. Bruce and Selina come down, see her true intent and Alfred tells them to run while he fends off all three attackers. The kids run into a closet. The woman opens it and they are not there, it led to a secret passage. Alfred continues to fight off the men as Bruce and Selina run. He wants to help Alfred but Selina urges him on. The assailants give chase, Alfred shoots ones and also takes a hit himself in the arm. He yells ""Bruce!!!""

Gordon and the cops show up and Alfred explains. Bullock shows up and finds Selina's mug shot in one of the potential abductor's pockets. Alfred realizes Gordon didn't tell his partner. Gordon fills him on Selina being a witness and Dent trying to draw out Lovecraft. Bullock calls this plan foolishness and points out that it did not work. He and Alfred, still bleeding, are livid with Jim. Bullock reminds him that the Wayne case is closed. They bicker. Alfred tells them to shut up and go find Bruce. Jim says they probably went back to Gotham where Selina feels safe. Jim is going to find Dent and talk Lovecraft. Bullock is going to look for the kids and Alfred says he's coming. Bullock says Alfred is pretty handy for a valet. Alfred notes he's a butler.

Bruce is nervous as they approach the city, he's worried about Alfred. He says she should be worried since people were trying to kill her. She notes it was his house so they were more likely trying to kill him. She says when they're safe in the city she'll find him a phone. He thanks her. She snarks she's just trying to be nice.

At the Falcone mansion Cobblepot has been brought to see the boss. Falcone wants to know how Maroni knew where his money was. Cobblepot says the robbery at the armory wasn't Maroni. Falcone wants to know when Cobblepot turned on him. Cobblepot says he is a mole. Liza enters and is startled to see Cobblepot. He says it's Fish. Falcone knows Cobblepot hates her though. He says Fish makes a lot of money for him and asks him how to find the mole. Cobblepot says the mole will be found and will belong to Fish.

One of Falcone's other thugs, Gabriel, asks Cobblepot why he didn't rat out Liza since they know she's the mole. Cobblepot says timing is everything and to watch and learn.

Jim confronts Dent who tries to claim this as a win since Lovecraft is panicking. Jim hardly sees a win in two kids being pursued by contract killers. Dent says they can get Lovecraft to call them off. Jim is trying to figure out how anyone found out. Dent says for deep background he leaked Jim's name to a couple of sources. That's how someone found out. Dent gives Jim some addresses to look for the kids. Jim says if they're hurt it's on Dent.

Bullock and Alfred interrogate a friend of Selina's to find where she hangs. In Alfred's case, this means bribery. The friend says to ask Fish Mooney since she knows all the people Selina might've fenced her stolen goods to.

Falcone has a meeting with his lieutenants and ruthlessly shoots one during dinner saying he was the one who was supposed to guard the armory and possibly betrayed him. The others now look very nervous, not wanting to end up face down in their pasta. He says whoever else was involved will hope they die fast like that guy just did. Falcone tells them that they're tariffs will now all go up 25% until they can build up the reserves. While some balk he asks Fish her opinion and she says the family sinks or swims together.

Bruce and Selina find a phone and she wonders why he cares so much about a butler. Bruce says Alfred is his family. Selina tries to ditch Bruce and says those killers were after her and he should go home and she only told him they were after him so he would hang out with her longer. He finds her reasoning convoluted. She shrugs this office and shimmies up the fire escape. Bruce gives chase across a rooftop until she jumps to the other side. Stubbornly he decides to follow. She tries to tell him to stop but he jumps and makes it barely to the other side and she hauls him over. He asks her not run off again. She assents but says now that they're in her domain they play by her rules. He agrees.

They head into a big old squat house, she calls it like a mall for street kids. They are surrounded by all kinds of homeless kids.

Fish and Butch talk about Falcone's suspicions. She tells him to stick to the plan and to go get the captains angry about their tariff being raised to come over to her side to want to overthrow Falcone. Bullock arrives with Selina's mugshot. Butch doesn't recognize her so Bullock presses for Fish. Butch says she's busy. Alfred takes him to the floor. Fish materializes. Bullock shows Fish Cat's picture. Fish asks if she's the Lovecraft witness. Fish knows the story of her witnessing the Wayne murder. Fish laughs in his face at the idea of helping find Cat. Alfred points out that Bruce is with him and beseeches her for her help. She says helping them would work against her own interests. He appeals to her sense of honor and compassion. She says she'll make somecalls but he needs to remember this kindess.

Cat gets Bruce some grungy street clothes and she says he looks badass. She runs into Mario Pepper's daughter and Bruce introduces himself. She gets agitated and angry. Cat tells her to stay cool. She tries to. Cat asks if she's seen her fence Clyde. She has and Cat hustles Bruce away from the creepy, justifiably angry, little gir.

Jim busts into one of Lovecraft's safe house and he's there. They draw down on each other and he arrests him with conspiracy to commit the murder of Selina Kyle. Lovecraft claims he didn't do it, the people after Selina came and attacked him first. Lovecraft thinks it's ridiculous that Jim thinks he is ""somebody"" because the people that really run the city know he's small time, like Jim and they are laughing at him running around the city on his crusade to clean it up. Lovecraft offers to give him files in his briefcase, something to do with a run on Wayne stock right before their murders as if people knew something bad would happen to them.He's about to show Jim some incriminating files when the two remaining assassins show up.Jim takes care of the guy but the woman chokes him out while Lovecraft takes off running.

Jim wakes up to an empty apartment when his phone rings. Bullock has a lead on Clyde the fence Cat uses, he and Alfred head out.

Jim searches the apartment and finds Lovecraft dead in a tub, shot in the head, his service revolver on the ground. The assassins framed him.

Cat goes to see Clyde and offers him some trinkets, mostly stolen from Wayne Manor. She asks for $1,000. The guy offers $50. Bruce is offended knowing how much the stuff is worth. Clyde says they can make a deal and Cat changes her mind and she grabs the stuff but Clyde's henchmen grab them both. He sold them out to he assassins.

The henchmen throw Bruce and Cat in a locked room in a warehouse. She eyes the skylight. They build a makeshift ladder from some shelving and file cabinets.

The assassins pay Clyde. Cat makes it to the skylight as they approach the room. She gets it to open and she and Bruce hide. The asassin sees he open window, they smack him and run out another way. Alfred and Bullock arrive and the firefight begins. The female assassin spots Bruce and he runs while Cat stays put. There is shooting, running, crouching, and hiding. Jim arrives and joins in on all of his. Bruce confronts the female assassins by throwing pipes at her from above. Jim shoots the male assassin. The female holds a gun on Bruce and asks where his girlfriend is. He says he doesn't know. She asks him again saying she doesn't want to hurt him since he's not on the contract. Cat slips away. Bruce says she's gone. The woman stands down and tells Bruce to not mistake bravery for good sense. Alfred gets the drop on her but lets her go when he sees Bruce. They reunite. They both try to put on a brave face. Alfred notes that no one employs butlers anymore and so he can't die. They hug.

Alfred brings Bruce out to Jim who thanks god when he sees him.

Dent and Jim are dragged before the mayor who is mad about their secret plan and he's angry that Lovecraft is dead. The mayor wants to call it suicide, period and since it was Jim's gun he should shut up about it. Jim is lippy but Dent caves like a kiss ass. The mayor says he needs a scapegoat and it will be Jim since Dent is a kiss ass. Jim tells the mayor to kiss his ass. This gets him reassigned to duty at Arkham Asylum. Bullock wonders if he'll take it. Jim says it's that or quit. Bullock tells him to quit. Jim says he can't. Ed Nygma is upset Jim is disgraced and offers to write a complaint to the boss and gives him a big awkward hug. Jim assures Harvey that whoever his next partner is will be less of a pain in the ass. Harvey offers to buy him a drink. Jim says sometime and throws his belongings in a box and leaves.

Cat returns to Wayne Manor and brings the stuff she nicked. He offers to let her keep it since she needs it more than he does. She says she wants to keep things honest. She says she will keep one little special box. Then she gives him a big kiss and when they hear Alfred approach she slips away. He takes the bag of stuff from Bruce and notes the house seems quiet without her. Bruce agrees.

Jim enters the gates at Arkham."

In the station, they're searching for any history on Gruber. James Gordon interrupts the captain's briefing, but Captain Essen and Harvey Bullock try to hustle him out before the commissioner can arrive and blame Gordon for everything. The commissioner arrives and hauls Gordon and Bullock into his office.

Meanwhile, at the warehouse, after retrieving his machine, Gruber gets to work lobotomizing an employee.

In with the commissioner, Gordon rails against the Arkham experiment and promises he'll bring in Gruber and Danzig, after the commissioner reinstates him. They get 24 hours.

Carmine Falcone listens to a man beg for his life, and even though they're family, he's unmoved.

Later, he offers to set his housekeeper Liza up with a business so she can meet a nice man and get married. She tells him she prefers to stay with him, he makes her feel safe.

At the station, Ed brings Gordon and Bullock news that Jack Gruber is really Jack Bukinsky, and he wanted to be transferred to Arkham. Ed rushes off to follow up on the ""riddle"" he left for Miss Kringle -- a cupcake with a bullet in it. She found it ""menacing and weird and inedible"", she is un-charmed.

Bukinsky pulled four successful bank robberies, killing six people. He never named his accomplices.

They get called to the scene of the abandoned Arkham prisoner transport van. They notice Irwin's Electronics nearby. They find an electrocuted employee by the door. The lobotomized employee is mindlessly writing the same thing over and over on the wall like Bart Simpson: ""I will not betray my friends.""

Liza is grabbed off the street by masked men. She's relieved when she's brought to see Fish Mooney, who tells her she's ready to make her move against Falcone.

At home, Falcone gets a ransom call for Liza.

Back at the station, the newspaper has dubbed Gruber/Bukinsky ""The Electrocutioner."" Ed suggests Bullock and Gordon wear their department-issued rubber boots, just in case.

Dr. Leslie Thompkins drops by with a voodoo doll. The inmates make them and give them to a pagan sorceress on her wing. Gruber made ""Mr. M."" They both think it looks like Maroni.

Meanwhile, Oswald Cobblepot gets a call from Falcone's disappearance. He excuses himself from lunch with Maroni. The Irwin Electronics van sits outside. Oswald makes it to the door but is blown back off his feet by an electrified door handle. A light bomb is thrown into the restaurant.

Later, Maroni and most of the other men have survived. Gordon explains to Maroni who's after him and asks to take him into protective custody. Charred Oswald manages to sit up in the back of the ambulance and say he needs to leave for urgent business with Falcone.

Cut to Maroni and a goon carrying Oswald into the station.

Barbara Kean drops by her parents' mansion unannounced, hoping to stay a few days. She tells her prim mother that she's very happy with Gordon.

At the station, Maroni holds court while Gordon waits for Gruber to make his move. Oswald wakes up and tries to leave, but Maroni asks him about his business with Falcone.

Fish calls Falcone, saying she's acting as an intermediary. But he doesn't buy it for a minute, saying she was always the smart one. She tells him to leave town and she'll let him take Liza with him. Liza is prepared to go along with it, saying Falcone's always been good to her. Fish remind her she can never tell him the truth.

At home, Falcone seriously thinks about leaving town, over Victor's objections.

Ed tells Miss Kringle the answer to his riddle: ""The cupcake is sweet, the bullet is deadly: a beautiful woman's a dangerous thing."" She's touched for half a second, then goes back to being creeped out. Detective Arnold Flass interrupts, bullying Ed away.

Ed hears a power surge as he leaves, then hears Kringle tell Flass: ""He is so weird.""

Outside, Buckinsky drills into the station walls and hooks up his machine to its steel structure.

Inside, Oswald swears he has no business with Falcone and is about to leave when electricity starts flying through the air. The lights go out and everyone in the station drops.

Inside, Bukinsky is disappointed that everyone is only stunned, not dead. Gordon sneaks up on Bukinsky with a gun, saved by his rubber boots. But Bukinsky uses a weblike machine to latch onto Gordon's gun and super heat it. Danzig attacks Gordon, who somehow gets the upperhand against the giant. Bukinsky accuses Gordon of not caring about the law, just hating to lose.

Bukinsky charges his machine and prepares to lash out at Gordon. Gordon fights back in the simplest way possible: he tosses a cup of water on Bukinsky's circuits and fries them.

Later, Commissioner Loeb holds a splashy press conference and gives Gordon his badge back. Gordon whispers to him: ""The next man who tries to take away my shield, one way or another, I'm going to make him eat it.""

Gordon announces to Bullock that he's done being careful. Bullock scoffs at the idea that Gordon has been careful so far.

Oswald finally makes it to Falcone's house and relays what he knows: that Liza was planted by Fish from the beginning. Fish found a girl who looked just like Falcone's mother and taught her how to act. Falcone doesn't want to believe it.

Fish calls Falcone to meet in an hour. He arrives alone. Fish wants him to sign papers relinquishing control of the family, but he insists on seeing Liza first.

When Liza is brought out, he asks how long she's known Fish. Liza protests, but Falcone isn't convinced, noting a little bird told him what Fish put Liza up to. He reminds Fish how they used to talk about his mother. Falcone's armed muscle and Victor arrive, drawing on Fish.

Falcone sweetly strokes Liza's face and tells her he's sorry she got mixed up in everything. Then he chokes her to death with his bare hands.

He orders Fish kept alive for the moment. Above all, he's upset she used the memory of his dear mother against him. Falcone calls for Oswald, who relishes having the upper and against Fish.

At the station, Lee Thompkins drops in on Gordon. She feels dumb for coming when he doesn't immediately seem to understand why she's there. But he stops her from leaving and kisses her. They're interrupted by news of a shoot out at Fish's place."

We open on top of a roof. A man is tied to a chair. Another man hoists the chair up and hands the man over the edge of the building. He wakes the man in the chair up and he understandably freaks out. The hoister checks the man's heart beat with a stethoscope. He then ties a noose around his neck and releases him over the side of the building.

Maroni and Penguin toast Fish's likely demise with champagne at his restaurant. And then suddenly Maroni gets a call at the table from Fish herself. She tells him that Penguin is a snitch and that he and Falcone both played her and Maroni. Maroni says it's hard to believe. Fish says she knows he's had doubts about Penguin. She tells him to put his house in order and remember who put him wise. Maroni hangs up and says he needs to go upstate to talk to a guy and asks Penguin to go with him to talk about opportunities.

The GCPD investigate the dead guy, who has been hoisted back to the roof. The captain wonders why the killer hauled the victim back up. Nygma tells Harvey and the captain that the man has an incision in his abdomen. Harvey says Gordon is dealing with personal stuff and will be in soon. She notes they should all be careful in the wake of Flask's arrest.

Cat is chowing down on snacks at Jim's house when he arrives home yelling for Barbara. He notices his place in disarray and the cereal box on his desk. Cat sneaks around while he looks around. He grabs her and asks her how long she's been here. She says a few times since Barbara left and since he has been watching Arkham. He says he'll take her someplace safe since she's his only witness to the Wayne murders. She claims now that she lied about seeing anything, and that she told Bruce, offers condolences about his break-up with Barbara, and takes off.

Jim goes to see Bruce. He offers his hand and Bruce is reluctant to take it. Bruce was in Switzerland for awhile. Jim says Cat may be lying now because she's scared. Bruce says she doesn't scare easily and he believes she lied. Jim says someone sent assassins after her and only a guilty person does this. Bruce releases Jim from his promise to find his parents' killer and says he'll take it into his own hands and leaves. Jim tells Alfred it's too dangerous for Bruce to do on his own. Alfred says he'll look after him and shows Jim the door.

Maroni takes Penguin to a cabin in the woods, festooned with animal heads on the walls. They share coffee and oatmeal and Maroni says it's good to get out of the city sometimes in the fresh air and have a chance to reflect with a good friend. Penguin asks about ""the guy"" they are supposed to meet. Maroni tells him not to worry about it. He muses with Penguin about various matters that Penguin whispered in his ear. Maroni says they all have their talents, like he is deceptively quick for a big guy. He tells Penguin he is going to get some air.

Harvey meets with a Miss Mullens about the dead man. She was his sponsor in a support group. He breaks the news to her. The group was for people suffering from phobias. He scoffs at first and she tells him not to be an ass. The dead man's phobia was heights. He thinks it's possible someone from the group killed him. Harvey is clearly besotted by her and basically asks her to dinner after the next support group that night. He promises he will find who did this.

Jim arrives with a thin lead about the office chair the guy was tied to and they head off.

The hoister/killer from the open approaches an older man as he leaves his home. He has another man taser him and they throw him into the back of a van.

Nygma works on the dead man in the morgue feeling around to see what the killer was after. The captain and the M.E. come in and catch him with his hand in the corpse. He has already promised several times to stay out of the M.E.'s way. The captain suspends Nygma to appease the M.E. Nygma tries to say he found something but they're gone.

As they look through the office warehouse, Harvey asks about Barbara and Jim says it's definitely over and now he's seeing Dr. Lee Thompkins. They hear some screaming from the back of the warehouse. A tall man in a pig mask and a butcher's apron is swinging around an axe near the man who was just thrown in the back of the van, who is now and gagged and bound to a chair. A couple of pigs are also randomly roaming around. It is downright bizarre. Jim shoots the guy in the pig mask. Harvey thinks the led was not so thin after all.

Fish is on a tanker steaming away from Gotham. She has finely appointed accommodations.

Jim and Harvey report to the captain that the new almost victim was also part of the phobia support group. Harvey and the captain think the guy in the pig mask is their guy but Jim is not sure. He wants Nygma to look into it. She says he can't. She warns him again to be careful in the week of the Flask thing.

Nygma goes to see Ms.Kringle to tell her he's been suspended. She is crying and she thinks it's because Flask was arrested. He returns a pencil he borrowed from her that he wore down to almost nothing. She says she's sorry he was suspended even though he is odd.

While Maroni is out getting wood, Penguin grabs a gun. Maroni returns and says they need to talk. Maroni says they should have real trust with each other, no secrets. Maroni admits there is no ""guy with a thing."" He tells Penguin to tell him a secret. Penguin claims he has none. He admits he doesn't like oatmeal. Maroni then shares that Fish is alive. Penguin now admits that he doesn't like coffee. Maroni says that Fish says he and Falcone are playing him. Penguin asks him if he believed her. Maroni says he is troubled. He asks Penguin for a good secret this time. Penguin says he took his gun and says he knew he might believe her but that doesn't mean it's true. He asks if Penguin has been playing him. Penguin doesn't admit it and asks for another secret. Maroni says the gun is loaded with blanks. Penguin calls him a liar and shoots. Maroni wasn't lying. Penguin shoots and nothing. Maroni throws him to the ground.

Gordon meets with Lee for dinner and she thinks it's a date and he is there to talk about his case. She is disappointed since she put on lipstick and he wants forensic advice. He says he doesn't mean to be and the case was a pretext to see her. She says he doesn't need it. He tries to put it away but she says she's interested. He then gets a call and he has to go. He leaves her with the case file and a kiss.

Gordon leaves a message with Harvey saying the second almost victim woke up and says there were two men who abducted him so another perp is still out there.

Harvey goes to the phobia group to chat with them about the case and he talks more with Ms. Mullens about phobias adn that everyone has one even him. He admits, whether truthfully or to get in her pants, that he is scared all the time and would share it with the group if she thought it would be helpful. She says it would. Before they go in he grabs a coffee and the evil man who is his perp gets coffee beside him and asks if it's his first time. Harvey says it is and returns the question and the man says he's been coming a long time.

Maroni takes Penguin to a dump where he tells him he is going to put him in a car and the car is going into the crusher and he is sending what's left of Penguin to Falcone. Penguin begs for his life and says he can give him more information. Maroni says it's personal since Frankie was a friend and he is disgusted that he ever fell for Penguin's crap. Maroni puts him in the car.

Nygma sneaks back into the precinct locker room and grabs some M.E. tools.

Harvey explains to the group how he is afraid everyday of getting killed by a perp and bleeding out in a gutter alone. He says he wants to die in a warm cozy bed in the arms of a beautiful woman. The man Harvey met earlier says his name is ""Todd"" and he has a horrible phobia of failure,of any kind, and he inherited from his father and is afraid he's passing it on to his son. Todd is very emotional and walks out. Ms. Mullens chases after him.

Penguin calls Maroni from inside the crusher and begs him to listen to him. He says whoever controls Arkham will control Gotham. Maroni tells him to take it like a man. Penguin calls the guy operating the crusher and says that he works for Don Falcone and that his men are on the way to kill him if he crushes Penguin. The guy stops the crusher and runs off. Maroni sees this, gives chase, shoots after the guy and then turns to see Penguin has escaped the car. He is not happy.

Harvey asks the support group if it seems like ""Todd"" and Ms. Mullens have been gone a long time. He goes out just as ""Todd"" has thrown her in the back of his van and drives off.

The M.E., who hates Nygma, goes into the locker room and opens his locker and finds a bunch of dismembered limbs. Some other cops walk in and the M.E., holding a bunch of arms, says this is not what it looks like.

Jim and Harvey explain what happened at the support group meeting to the captain. Mullens phobia was drowning in a pool, they go to the pool where she almost drowned as a child assuming that's where he took her.

""Todd"" is with Mullens at the edge of the pool and says he's going to drown her. Suddenly his son enters and says the parking meter ran out. He looks at the bound and gagged Mullens uneasily. ""Todd"" says it's for greater humanity and gives him money to feed the meter. ""Todd"" drops her in the pool. She sinks to the bottom. Jim and enter guns drawn. Jim gives chase while Harvey dives in to save Mullens.

Jim and ""Todd"" have a gun fight and ""Todd"" gets away. Harvey revives Mullens.

Penguin is awakened on the side of the road, where he apparently slept, by an elderly black woman and her church group. They ask what happened to him. He quotes Bible verses to them and they are impressed and invite him on their little school bus for a ride back to Gotham. They sing gospel songs as they ride.

Lee brings the case file back to Jim at the precinct and she tells him the killer removed his adrenal gland, what is essentially the fear gland. He takes it when they are at the height of their fear meaning it has a massive amount of cortisol in it. She calls him one weird dude. She figures he's a doctor or a nurse given the clean cuts. Jim says it's clear that she is into this stuff and it turns out that the M.E. job is now open and she should apply and asks her to dinner to discuss it. They joke about his crude dating skills. He says he has a powerful urge to kiss her. She asks why he doesn't. He says he has a image to keep up and people are watching. She gives him three seconds to kiss her or no dinner. He does, and everyone watches.

Nygma tells Ms. Kringle he's been reinstated in the wake of the M.E. being fired for stealing body parts. Sh tells him he owes her a new pencil.

Fish is awakened from her slumber on the ship to a firefight outside her a room. A large man busts into her room and they charge at each other."

The hunt continues for Crane.

An older man comes home during a dark and stormy night and is accosted by a hooded figure. He runs to the door and sees another. They are both men and have creepy zombie-like faces.

Fish wakes up in an industrial warehouse-type place full of men fighting. She asks a regular looking guy if she is dreaming. He says he hopes so. Two thugs stand menacingly, appraising Fish. Presumably with bad intent. She tells them the first man to come at her will die fast and the second will die slow. She asks whose first and they walk off. Regular-looking guy is impressed.

Jim and Lee are coming home from their third date and he wonders if he'll be getting an invite to her apartment. She says yes but not tonight since she starts a new job in the morning. She's coming to work at the GCPD as the new medical examiner. He claims it's good. She says they'll see. They share a goodnight kiss and she steps into a cab.

Gordon meets Harvey at the crime scene of the guy from the opening. He has the same surgical incisions as past victims of Crane and is missing his adrenal glands. Gordon wonders what he's doing with them. We cut to Crane grinding them up and then creating some kind of liquid and filling a syringe with it. He creeps down a hallway and then injects himself with the liquid. His eyes become quite green and he falls to the floor. He sees a woman walking down the steps and she bursts into flames and asks why he won't help her.

Bruce is packing and Alfred offers to come with him, wherever he is going. Bruce demurs and says it wouldn't be right. Bruce assures him that he will be fine and will be back before dark. He says his father would've approved of carrying on this tradition they had together. (Apparently, they took an overnight trip and watched the sunrise together.)

Penguin is explaining to Falcone about what happened to him almost getting killed as they walk through Fish's ruined club. Penguin is worried that Maroni is planning to retaliate against him. Falcone asks him to clean the place up. He also wants him to redesign to get rid of the Fish-y feeling. Penguin is pleading with him for protection but Falcone seems more concerned about rebuilding the nightclub. Falcone says he wants to reopen the club and have Penguin run it and his days of sneaking around and spying are over. He's earned that. He says they are now together publicly so he wants him to spruce up the place and leave Maroni to Falcone.

Lee shows up for her first day of work and Gordon pretends to the captain that he only knows her from Arkham. She plays along. It is stiff. Harvey welcomes her aboard and tells Jim that office romance always ends in tears and he knows from experience. They find Crane in a yearbook, he's a high school biology teacher. They head back to school.

Fish introduces herself to regular looking guy who is named Kelly. He tells her this place is considered a prison by some. He quickly stops her when ""breakfast"" arrives in the form of slop buckets thrown threw the bars. They have to let he ""Boss"" eat first, he is named Mace. He is a fearsome bearded man.

Bruce walks through the woods and picks up a rock from a pile, he goes back to the pile and takes another.

Jim and Harvey go to the school where Crane hasn't shown up for weeks. The principal tells them that he was a good teacher and father and lost his wife to a car accident years ago. They ask if he ever talked about fear or phobias. She asks if someone is killing ""phobics"" and if they were missing their adrenal glands. She shows them an academic paper he wrote a few months back on how fear was an evolutionary flaw. She says he was trying to cure himself of fear and that's what the syringes are about. He's killing the phobics while they are afraid spiking their fear and then harvesting adrenal glands to cure himself. They discover there is another test subject and wonder who it is.

We cut back to Crane in the hallway of crazy looking at the burning woman. She disappears and we see his son approach from behind wondering if he's okay. Crane says he's glorious and that it's working. He says it's almost Jonathan's turn to be cured of fear and asks if he's ready.

Maroni and Falcone go for a stroll outside on the grounds at Falcone's. They agree that they are ""friends."" Maroni says a sandwich and a stroll won't keep him from killing Penguin. Falcone says ""So be it.""

Meanwhile Penguin is furiously overseeing the remake of the club, now called Oswald's. He is excited to send out the invites for the opening. He will deliver one in person.

Fish approaches the ""Boss"" Mace. She says she just wants a word. She asks why he is the boss. He says he has the only knife in he whole place. She says she wants to make a deal and says she might have skills useful to him. She kneels down before him and says ""all kinds"" of skills and if he protects her from the others she will show him. He asks ""You think you're worth protecting?"" She says he has no idea.

Oswald delivers his in person invite to Jim Gordon but he's not there. He is eyed and trailed by Nygma. Penguin turns to him and asks what he wants. He offers a riddle. Penguin doesn't like riddles. He says he knows who he is. He offers up odd Penguin facts. Penguin says it was nice to meet him and tells him to keep moving. Jim and Harvey emerge and Penguin delivers his party invite. Jim declines. He offers his help on his case if it's tricky since they've worked well in the past. Jim tells him he shouldn't be there. Penguin says one day soon Jim will need his help and asks him to reconsider his invitation. Jim junks the invite.

Crane shoots up his son with his adrenal juice, telling him he loves him and wouldn't harm him. Jonathan's eyes go big and green and freaks out and Crane says to look in his eyes. Jonathan screams.

Bruce continues his walk through the woods. He comes upon another artful pile of stones. He takes the ones he took earlier and places one on a pile with his initials and one marked by his father's initials. He looks sad. He takes his father's initialed stone in hand and throws it into the woods. He then throws more and kicks the piles over in anger. He sinks down and cries. He grabs his bag and stalks off. Suddenly, he falls and tumbles down a steep grade, hitting several fallen logs along the way. He realizes he is injured and stranded with a rain storm approaching. His ankle is severely banged up.

Lee and Jim chat at the office. She says her first day is busy. She gives him a quick smooch. He asks her not to do that in the office since it's not professional. She says she should hope not. Bullock approaches.

Falcone offers Maroni a cigar. Maroni wonders why Falcone wants to keep Penguin alive. Falcone says he's a clever and clever enough to know that he'll never be the boss and he likes to keep clever people around. Falcone offers money at first but Maroni says that won't do. Falcone instead offers to whack a judge that Maroni hates. Maroni says his head and 200k will buy Penguin. Falcone says he can do better than his head. He opens a curtain to reveal the judge behind glass. He is bound and gagged and crying as a woman whips him and a young man lays dead near by. Falcone caught him with the young man and is now offering to share in torturing him with Maroni. Maroni likes the view.

Gordon and Bullock go over the case and Bullock asks if Jim will asks Penguin for his help. Jim says no he wants to get inside Crane's head instead, find out why he was obsessed with fear. They look up the wife's car crash and it turns out she died in a house fire. Crane was in the house when his wife died and he didn't save her because he was afraid of the fire and now he's ashamed. We cut to Crane in the house having the vision of his wife on fire. He calls out to his son who has taken off running outside. Crane says they need to stick with the protocol but Jonathan pleads that he is not afraid in the same way his father is. Crane says all people on the planet are paralyzed by fear. He tells Jonathan he just wants to help him and mankind and tells him to be brave. He says it will be over before he knows it. They have this conversation in front of a creepy, decrepit scarecrow.

Alfred looks out at the darkening sky and checks his watch, clearly worried. Bruce tries to get moving in the woods. He drags himself to a stick, breaks it and ties it to his leg like a brace with a belt. He grabs his backpack and begins to climb up the embankment down which he fell.

Fish goes to see Mace. She kinda, sorta flirts with him. He calls her a firecracker and she says he's looking at the 4th of July. He asks her not to talk too much and calls her baby. She says not to call her baby and stabs him with his own knife in the neck. He falls to the ground. She holds the knife up to the group and announces that she is in charge now.

Harvey and Jim arrive at the house and Jonathan wants to run. Crane says they have to finish the protocol. Jim and Harvey enter the house, guns drawn. Crane and Jonathan run outside and he plunges a huge dosage of adrenal glands into him over his protests. Jonathan looks up at the scarecrow and begins screaming and howling. Harvey and Jim draw on Crane. He says he has no fear and shoots at them. He should have some because they shoot him back,dead. Jim goes to the writhing, spasming Jonathan and yells to Harvey to call an ambulance.

Bruce continues to scrabble up the hill. Winded. He comes upon Alfred at the top. He has built a fire. Bruce asks how long he's been there. He says an hour. Bruce sarcastically thanks him for his help. Alfred notes he didn't get him down there. He helps Bruce to his feet. Bruce says he's cold, tired, and his ankle is sprained and wants to go home. Alfred asks if he'd rather stay and watch the sunrise like he did with his dad. Bruce says they can stay if Alfred can handle it. Alfred says it's cushy compared to some of the places he's been.

We cut to opening night at Oswald's. His nenn sign is an umbrella. It's pretty quiet except for a noisy band onstage and Maroni and his gang. He compliments Penguin on the club and how far he's risen. He says he chatted with Falcone and all is kosher with them as long as Penguin doesn't give Falcone any of Maroni's secrets.Maroni pours champagne and says Penguin better hope Falcone lives a long life because the second he's gone, so is Penguin.

Alfred rouses Bruce for sunrise.

Lee is working in her lab when Jim arrives. She apologizes, hearing his suspect was killed at the scene. She asks him to let her know how the son does. Jim asks if she thinks she'll like it. She says she does so far. She invites him to the circus. He says yes. He reiterates no kissing on the job. She agrees but still mocks him for being afraid to be seen as unprofessional to show his feelings. She says she'll be discreet and gives him a peck.

Fish addresses her new minions and says that up until now there's been no order in this place and with her in charge, things are going to change. A new prisoner is brought in and thrown to the ground she crawls in on her knees moaning that they took her eyes. And indeed her sockets are a bloody, scary mess.

At the hospital the doctor explains to Jim that Jonathan was shot up with an odd combination of stuff including the adrenal gland tissue as well as another element they can't put their finger on. He says it nearly killed him but he will live. They ran a CT scan and notes the effects of the hormones have worn off but his brain activity shows that he's in a constant state of intense terror and they don't know if it ever will. He asks him to imagine the thing he fears the most and that it is all you see every waking hour. Jonathan writhes in pain on the bed as a vision of the creepy scarecrow climbs over and attacks him."

We open on a sleeping Bruce Wayne. It is a dark and stormy night. He has a notebook on his lap filled with questions.

We cut to Oswald's club where he is beaming at his mom as she performs on stage. The other patrons roll their eyes.

Down in the weird prison, Fish awakes and wakes everyone else with a clap. People line up to drink water from a faucet.

Barbara returns home drunk to find Cat and a friend squatting in her apartment. She asks where Jim is. Cat tells her that he dropped off his keys last week. Barbara says screw him anyway. She asks who the girls are.

Jim and Dr. Leslie enjoy the feats of the circus, watching the men on the flying trapeze and canoodling. A clown car arrives and the clowns start assaulting the circus performers. Jim holds up his badge and tells everyone to freeze.

Back in the club Mama Cobblepot finishes to no applause until Penguin starts some. A man comes in booing calling her an old bag. Penguin kills him.

Jim interviews the clowns who began attacking people. None of them seem to know why. Leslie tends to circus performer wounds. There is apparently a family feud among the circus folk, the Graysons versus the Lloyds.

One of them says it's ""Lila's fault"" and another shushes her. Leslie tells Jim this was the best date ever and tells him the leads she got about Lila, a snake dancer. He offers to have her driven home. She wants to come with him to meet Lila. Jim asks the Ringmaster after Lila and he takes them to the performer trailer park. Her son Jerome answers, he hasn't seen her since this morning. She left without her hat, coat, and purse. The ringmaster says Lila is a ""party girl."" Jim wants to let her snake out thinking it will lead them to Lila. The four of them- Leslie, Jim. the Ringmaster, and Jerome-- follow. The snake leads them to a truck where Lila is dead under the back of a tarp. Jerome collapses in despair. Jim says the Ringmaster knew she was there. He says she was like that when they found her.

Back in crazy tunnel prison, Fish addresses the inmates while standing atop the back of a man on all fours. She says the wardens are keeping them as transplant donors and they need to do something about it and she has a plan and they must do what she says. She says some of them will make it out alive and some will die, and they will die with dignity and a purpose and next to family, since they are all they have. She urges them to fight. They seem to want to follow her.

Back at the circus the Ringmaster leads them to where they found Lila's body and they were going to give her a proper burial. The heads of the circus families figured if it was an outsider it was an act of god and if it was a circus person they have their ways of rooting them out. Jim says the GCPD has its ways too. He arrests all the circus people and brings them back to the precinct to the amusement of Harvey.

Jim interviews Jerome who says his mother was perfect except for being a bad cook. She has lots of FWBs but no actual boyfriends. Jerome says his mother's love life didn't bother him and says sex is a healthy human activity and without his mother's love life he wouldn't be there. He says he has no other family other than the circus.

Jim interviews one of the men that was sleeping with Lila who attacked another man sleeping with Lila who he thought she was going to pick. Both men think the other man killed her. They have centuries old grudges against each other.

Back in the prison, Fish leads the revolt on the guards. She starts by trying to negotiate with them for water and blankets and...magazines. They say they want their prisoner. She instructs her thugs to kill the guy. She notes that the prisoners have value only alive and they will kill each other if need be. The lead guard is freaked and says she needs to see the boss. She invites him down. The guard says she has to come with them. She says she will as long as he's willing to stay down here while she does. Thinking better of that, he says he will be back with the boss. She says to deliver the items on her list in the meantime. The prisoners cheer and then remember the dead guy. Fish goes and kisses his forehead.

The captain is impressed, amused, and annoyed by Jim's snake following trick and the precinct full of circus folk. Harvey calls it a doozy. Nygma and Leslie present info about Lila's death, knife/hatchet wounds. Jim sends the non-suspect circus people home and tells them to stop their feud.

Leslie is impressed when he acts all tough. She wants to finish their date. She offers to cook him dinner at her place. She asks if he had to guess who would he think killed Lila. He says he doesn't like to guess. A blind man, led by a small boy, walks in and claims he's a psychic and he knows who Jim and Leslie are. His name is Cicero and he says Lila sent him a message from the other side. Lila told him that a servant of the devil lies in the garden of the iron sisters. Leslie is intrigued, Jim is sarcastic. Cicero says to make of the message what he will. Leslie chides Jim for not being open-minded. They bicker a bit, she is clearly a potential believer, he is not.

Alfred tells Bruce his meeting with the board of Wayne Enterprises has been confirmed. He tells Bruce he thinks it's a bad idea, reckless and dangerous. Bruce says his mind is made up. Alfred says ifthey're both found dead in a ditch not to blame him.

Back at Oswald's he plays ""Heart and Soul"" on the piano onstage, while some of his thugs play poker at a table.

A sassy Barbara models a cute, mini-skirt outfit to get Jim back. Cat and her friend say they have to dress like she's not trying. Apparently, they've all become fast friends.

Jim goes to have dinner at Leslie's. He cuts into her food and praises it highly. Leslie thinks she's decoded the psychic message, she thinks it references the women in the iron gates of Arkham. He dismisses. She calls him arrogant in his certainty and this could be a clue. He says he'll check it out. She says she'll go with and wants to go now since it's only half a mile away.

They head to the bridge near the gates and a park underneath. He says they shouldn't make a habit of this since it's no place for a lady. She busts him saying that he says he wants a strong woman to keep up with his crazy life but when push comes to shove he wants her home baking cookies. He says he'd prefer pie. They find a hatchet engraved with the initials of Satanic cult that was thought inactive. There is blood on the handle. Jim calls it in.

Jim and Lee head back to the precinct and he has two people in separate rooms. They bicker again about him being right about something and he notes that he is and she was the one that wanted to find Satanist hatchets and she knew what he wanted to do.She agrees and says she gets overly enthusiastic about things. She is about to quote her mother when she realizes he doesn't care about what her mother said and tells him to let her know how it turns out and leaves, in a small huff. He calls her back. He admits she was right about being a hypocrite and invites her into the interrogation. She gloats a bit.

They talk to Mr. Cicero again and talk about the hatchet. Jim says Cicero is an accessory to the murder and he invented the message and planted the hatchet for them to find so the police think that Satanist's were responsible and that he is protecting someone. Jerome arrives. Jim accuses Jerome of killing his mother and being in cahoots with Cicero to plant the evidence. He thinks Cicero is his dad and that is why he helped protect Jerome. Cicero crumbles and confesses. Jerome is confused and sad and starts to cry and then he starts laughing and says ""My mother was a cold-hearted whore who never loved anyone"" including crummy old man Cicero. His whole demeanor has changed and he begins to smile and giggle and confesses to killing his mother.

Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have met the Joker.

Lee is saddened by this turn of events. Jim goes to check on her in the locker room. She says she's good and that it was ugly but it was also kind of thrilling, like looking down a deep,dark tunnel and thanks him for letting her be there and kisses. He calls her an unusual woman. She says he just doesn't know many women. She asks if they can go home now. They kiss., passionately, just as Barbara walks in and is not happy with what she sees.

A woman plays the violin onstage at Oswald's. Victor Zsaz arrives and tells him that Don Falcone thinks he's messing up the club financially. Victor is with Butch and Oswald gasps and reels back at the sight of Fish's former right hand man. Zsaz giggles and says Butch is harmless. Falcone didn't want to ""throw him away"" so Victor ""worked on him"" in his basement and he seems oddly docile and agreeable and Victor says he knows the club business and will do exactly what Oswald says. Penguin asks him to dance and Butch begins to hoof it up.

Bruce meets with the Wayne Enterprises Board. He opens his notebook and starts asking questions about underworld involvement in Arkham and chemical weapons manufacturing.

The circus folk thank Jim for his help. Harvey wonders why Jim is so happy and realizes he had sex. Jim grins.

Bruce lays down his concerns. The board says these are shocking stories and rumors and that they will look into it. He says he hopes they will because he'll be raising these issues at the shareholders meeting. They are outwardly calm but obviously concerned.

The guard returns and says she has a deal with the manager: she'll go up and see him and Schmidt the guard will stay down there in the prison. She asks his name: Thomas Schmidt. She takes his baton and says her family will show him a good time. She walks out under guard."

Well this was gruesome.

We have five separate storylines tonight.

Back at the scary prison-cum-spare parts factory Fish is taken to see the manager. Along the way she peers into rooms she passes and sees people with missing limbs and eyes. After she learns that the man she is speaking to just manages the place--- they sell their spare parts all over the world and the in house doctor does ""experiments""-- and doesn't own it she demands to speak to him, a Dr. Dolemacher. The manager tries to talk with her and says that perhaps a shower and a set of fresh clothes will make her more amenabble. Unfortunately for Fish when she returns all clean and in nice white clothes he tells her that she has two options, he takes her eyes from her right now-- he notes she has remarkable ones that will fetch a high price and two men are ready behind her to put her in a straitjacket-- or he can kill everyone in the basement which would be inconvenient. She notes that he forgot the third option and grabs a spoon and digs out her own left eye, flings it on the floor, and stomps on it. Um, ew. She then promptly collapses.

Meanwhile, over at Barbara's Cat seems to feel guilty about the mess she and her friend have made of the place. She goes to thank Barbara for letting them stay and says she was just about to leave. Barbara is already swigging booze in what appears to be the morning since she is clearly still upset from seeing Jim making out with Leslie.. She looks at Cat and says she's turning into a beautiful woman. Cat disagrees. Later, Barbara lays out a bunch of her fancy clothes and tells the girls to take whatever they like. She holds one sparkly dress up in front of Cat in a mirror and tells her her beauty can be a weapon as powerful and deadly as any knife or gun. Disgusted, Cat asks Barbara exactly what he beauty has done for her and walks out.

Penguin is having problems of his own. He can't seem to book anyone good at his club-- we watch a terrible comic get booed offstage-- and he's run out of booze because Maroni controls Gotham's liquor supply and if he can't kill Penguin he's going to squeeze his business. Butch tells Penguin he needs to do something post-haste and that he put his blood and sweat into the club when Fish owned it and he doesn't want to see it fail. Penguin hatches a plan to rob a liquor shipment but Butch is one step ahead and has some fake cops commandeer the shipment instead. Either way, free booze! Back at the club they toast to no longer being sidekicks. When Penguin tries to toast Fish-- whom he says he oddly misses and muses that our enemies define us even more than our friends--Butch won't drink with him saying Fish got what she deserved.

Harvey and Jim are running down the ""Red Hood"" Gang, a group of bank robbers whose seeming leader wears a red hood.

They are a quintet of idiots but they cased the first bank the first time and timed the response time. They pull off the first heist but just as they're about to get busted, the original guy wearing the red hood gets the smart idea to throw some of the money in the air to cause gridlock with the people on the street so the police can't get through.

When they are counting their money, Red Hood man proclaims that the security guard in the bank couldn't hit him with a single bullet because the hood was magical. This is, of course, hogwash, but an older, greedier member of the team gets sick of him and shoots him and takes the hood. In the next heist he is the man, except that a local restaurant owner sees him take the hood off and IDs him in a line-up. Harvey and Jim follow him back to his apartment where yet another member of the gang believes the hood has power-- in this case, the robberies are in the paper of the ""red hood"" gang throwing money out to the people and he thinks showing his girlfriend the hood will keep her from leaving him. So he shoots the old guy. Harvey and Jim enter and save his life and notice that the man has three loan rejectiong from banks. He wanted to open a bakery but had no collateral so they were revenge robberies. They now know where the next robbery will take place and roll up before it can go down. The guy in the hood thinks he can't be shot, and he's wrong as the police take him down. Later, a young boy grabs the discarded hood, puts it over his head, makes finger guns and shoots at the police.

And finally, Alfred is paid a visit from an old buddy named Reginald Payne. They served in the British Special Air Service together. (From their descriptions of covert missions and killings to Bruce it sounds like the equivalent of SEALs/Special Forces). Reggie has been down on his luck--lost his house, his wife, and his sobriety-- so Alfred and Bruce offer to take him in for a few days. Alfred cleans him up. Reggie spars with Bruce a bit, encouraging the boy to really hit him and starts to show him special tactics when Alfred stops him. Later, when they're regaling Bruce with tales of their exploits -- and Reggie and Alfred enjoy some wine-- Reggie notes that he and Alfred killed a lot of men. Alfred sends Bruce to bed but he overhears Reggie asking him why he doesn't show Bruce who he really is. Later still, Alfred catches Reggie in the study stealing from the Manor. Reggie says he's in real trouble. Alfred offers to help and when this is turned down he says it's time for Reggie to leave. Instead, Reggie stabs him and leaves him for dead. Bruce finds him and calls for an ambulance. Later, Jim shows up at the hospital to find a distraught Bruce saying that he can't lose Alfred since he is all he has left. Jim comforts him.

We cut to Reggie in the boardroom of Wayne Enterprises showing them the photos that he took of Bruce's various files and evidence wall. He says Bruce has a lot of theories and questions but no real evidence of anything. He says Alfred will either die or be in the hospital for several weeks so now is the time to ""take care"" of Bruce. They hand him an envelope with a bunch of money for his spy services and thank him. He lamely tries to beseech them that Bruce is a good kid. They dismiss him."

We open on Alfred in the hospital with Bruce at his side and Jim checking in on him. Alfred complains about the food. Apparently, it's the next day. Jim asks who did it. Bruce is about to say until Alfred clearly tries to cover up for his ""friend"" Reggie who stabbed him. Jim gets a call from the captain and leaves and Bruce asks why not tell him the truth. Alfred says he's no snitch and he will sort Reggie out himself. And he's eager to do it, ripping out his IV and getting out of bed even though he is clearly too weak to do so. Bruce orders him back in bed.

A woozy, one-eyed Fish wakes up in the prison/hospital and meets the famous Dr. Francis Dulmacher, the founder of the facility. He says it's a pleasure to meet her. She says she has gone to great lengths to meet him. He agrees and is clearly impressed with her. She offers to be his right-hand man. He doesn't know Falcone is so he's not impressed but she points out it's better to have her as his friend than his enemy. She applauds her panache and tells her to eat. And also informs her that he's given her a new eye but couldn't match her original color. She goes to a mirror, takes off her bandage and sees a bright blue eye.

Harvey Dent arrives at the precinct with the newspaper saying the charges against Flask has been dropped even though they had Flask's prints on the gun. Dent says it's all political and Commissioner Loeb is going to give Flask a promotion in the GCPD. Jim is disgusted and storms out of the captain's office, right into Flask, who invites him to his promotion party. Jim demurs. Flask says Gordon can't take him down because he's like a rising Phoenix.

Jim goes to confront Loeb who isn't interested in the fact that Flask is a murder and Loeb is bad cop. Loeb does not care. He shows him video of Harvey ""confessing"" that he presented false evidence against Flask. And that right there is Loeb's trump card.

Jim confronts Harvey who says he did what he had to do, what Loeb told him to do, what he needed to do that keep himself out of prison. He notes that Jim isn't the only one with a skeleton in his closet and that, as the title implies, everyone has a Cobblepot. Harvey killed a mobster. He tells Jim all the cops have something like this and it's what Loeb does. He says Jim needs to fall in line. Jim says the day he does that is the day he quits being a cop.

Edward Nygma goes to Ms. Kringle and tells her fun facts about bodily fluids in an awkward way to get information from her about Flask, whom she dated. She says she now knows there are far better men in the world than Flask implying strongly that Nygma is one of them.

Jim goes to Dent to explain how Loeb uses dirt on cops, businessmen, and politicians to exert influence. Dent says he has nothing on him. Jim wants to find Loeb's cache of video evidence and destroy it and thus destroy his influence. They try to figure out how to find it. Jim claims he doesn't know what Loeb has on Harvey. Dent gets a lightbulb.

They head back to the precinct and interrogate Loeb's former partner Griggs in the locker room. He claims that Loeb was with him when his wife died-- an old rumor has it that Loeb killed his wife-- and that he knows nothing about any secret files but Jim and Dent both know he's lying. The guy says they are out of their depth and should swim back to shore. Jim realizes that Loeb has something on this guy too. He sweats Griggs about what it is. He says he doesn't know what they are talking about but that Loeb always said that to keep something safe to give it to this Chinese bookie he knows, Shi Lu.

Fish tells Dulmacher that she likes her new eye. She reminds him the people in the basement trust her and she will continue the flow of healthy organs to him. He shows her into his office and talks about how he is fascinated by replacing parts until the person becomes something new. She asks if they have a deal. He says conditionally: she will return to the basement, give back his guard, and keep the organs coming. She asks what happens if she fails. He takes her to a room and says that people who fail him still have their uses and shows her the man who used to be his ""office manager,"" the one that Fish first met. Dulmacher has replaced most of his body parts to make him a woman. The man is, understandably, upset. He has a kicking red manicure though.

Bruce reads to Alfred at his bedside. Cat comes to visit and mocks what he is reading as depressing. She tells him that Ivy spotted him and asks if he's okay. She hugs him and says she's sorry. He smiles. He tells her what happened. He says he thinks Reggie was there because of him, astutely assessing the board sent someone Alfred would trust to spy on him. He says he's going to track him down. Cat scoffs but then offers to help. He doesn't want anyone else to get hurt. She says he knows how to find her.

Jim and Dent go see Shi Lu who works underneath a Chinese restaurant. He claims to not know Loeb. Dent tries to squeeze him. Lu gets a call on his cell phone. He then somehow knows their names. He tells them to wait right there, and suddenly all the men sitting around the table counting big wads of cash draw a myriad of weapons. Dent and Jim run but they are cornered in an alley. Harvey busts through a fence with a car and rescues them.

Dent wants to go back. Harvey says it will be too late. He says he will get the information. His methods are, unorthodox. He takes Griggs and holds his head out the door near the pavement while Jim drives and Griggs admits that Loeb is in cahoots with Falcone and they are crazy to go after them. After they let him go, Harvey is inclined to agree with Griggs and says who would talk? Jim has an idea.

They go to see the Penguin at the club. He claims to be happy to see them and asks what he can do for them. They present their case and Penguin notes that if he found out where the video/evidence cache is tells them it could cost him his life and asks what's in it for him. Jim says he will owe the Penguin a favor. Harvey knows this is a bad idea. Penguin points out a valuable bottle of wine on the table and that it is Maroni's favorite and says this information could prove useful. His deal? If he helps Harvey and Jim find the secret files he wants 10 minutes alone with the files and is allowed to take what he wants. Harvey again notes this is a bad idea. But Jim says he gives him five minutes and he doesn't touch anything that has to do with cops. That plus a favor from Jim Gordon and Penguin is in.

Fish goes back to the basement to rally the troops. She says they will get their demands met when, in a show of good faith, they return the guard they are holding hostage. She then snaps her fingers and men come and take away two people, including her buddy Kelly. One of the prisoners complains that Fish is working for ""them"" now. She reminds them that she told them not everyone would live and that these deaths will ensure survival for the many so she kept her promise.

Jim, Harvey, and Penguin go to an old big house in the country where Penguin thinks the files are. He wants to stay in the car to avoid being seen. Jim and Harvey are having none of that. Suddenly an older man knocks on the car window. Penguin makes up a story that Loeb sent them. The old man invites him inside where he and his wife serve them coffee and cake and they claim that Loeb was worried about security and sent them to inspect the place. The old man tells his wife to get the ""keys"" and she returns with a shotgun and she and the old man open fire. Harvey shoots the man. Penguin crawls away but is confronted by the older woman, Jim shoots her and she falls and knocks her head. Neither is dead, however, so Jim hands a grateful Penguin her shotgun and tells him to watch them while they look around. Jim and Harvey head up to the locked attic and, shockingly, find a thirtysomething woman dancing around and singing to herself. She is clearly touched and, it turns out, Loeb's daughter, Miriam.

Back at the precinct a suit clad Nygma gives Ms. Kringle flowers and asks her out to dinner for that night. Sh demurs because she is dating a beat cop. He seems kind of crass but nice, and very handsome and offers Nygma a riddle that he solves easily. (What has hands but can't clap? A clock.) The beat cop calls Nygma ""riddle man"" and says he will stump him next time. Nygma dumps his flowers in the trash.

Jim, Miriam, and Harvey sit and chat. She explains she has always lived in the attic and her father comes to visit on Sundays, they play checkers and he lets her win. Jim, who is much nicer than Harvey, says his dad did that too. Jim asks what happened to her mother. Miriam says she died. She goes off to get something and Jim theorizes that Miriam saw Loeb kill her mother or maybe even killed her and that is why she is locked up, she is, in essence, Loeb's own Cobblepot. She returns and shows them the ""jewelry"" she makes in her spare time.

It is made of dead starling bones. They land on her windowsill and ""you can catch them if you're really silent and still."" And she notes she can be very silent. She says she crushes the back of their heads. Jim asks about her mother's death. She says sometimes people make mistakes or at least that's what her father said. He asks if she made a mistake with her mother, like with the birds. She says not like with the birds, she had to use a candlestick on her mother. Her mother wouldn't stop singing. Apparently, there was a party for her when she was a teen and was supposed to sing at the party but her mother wouldn't stop, so she killed her with a candlestick, as you do. Her dad covered it up.

The older couple overpowers Penguin and escape. He apologizes to Jim and asks if what Loeb is hiding is there. Jim says it is. Penguin says they had a deal and he wants a look. And just then Miriam comes out. She notes that Penguin looks just like a bird. Then she says, ""I love birds."" (Creepy! Run Penguin!)

Jim goes to see Loeb, armed with this new information. He drops one of Miriam's ""necklaces"" on his desk. Loeb says Miriam is sick and didn't mean to hurt her mother but she just has these urges. He says to go ahead and expose him, he can weather the scandal. Jim says he knows why he has had her locked away, he loves her sincerely and wants to keep her out of Arkham. Jim says he'll keep doing it. Loeb says Jim is colder than he thought. Jim agrees it would appear that way. Loeb says he will step down if he keeps Miriam out of it. Jim doesn't want him to resign since he will likely be replaced by another Falcone lapdog. He wants Loeb to stay in place and basically black mail him, to get Flask prosecuted, and he can send all his evidence on the cops to Harvey for safekeeping, and they'll decide who to prosecute. Loeb says he loves his daughter but he loves living even more and if he does that he'll be a dead man. He says no, Jim can have Harvey's file and that's it. He asks if that's all. Jim says there's one more thing.

We cut to a press conference and Loeb endorsing Jim to be head of the policemen's union, the job that was supposed to go to the dirty cop Flask. Jim gives Harvey his file. Harvey looks at it and says to Jim, ""You know you tell yourself, I'll do this one bad thing and all the good things I'll do will make up for it, but they don't."" He notes that Penguin is going to come asking for his favor and tells Jim to be careful.

We cut to Penguin drinking from the famous bottle. He is with the older couple at the club. He tricked Jim and Harvey. He let them ""escape"" with the promise of hiding them away in Arizona to keep Loeb from killing them. He tells them that he only has one ticket though so only one can go. The old man says they've been together 20 years and won't split up. Penguin says it's the only choice. She asks how he's going to decide which one gets the ticket. Penguin says he's leaving it up to them, she promptly turns on her husband and beats him to death. She turns to Penguin and asks when the train is. He says there isn't one, he just needed their help. He pulls out the shotgun and notes he was down to one shell, and shoots her.

Fish goes to Dulmacher who says he's been thinking about having a salsa night at the facility for the guests-- the people who come to buy the black market organs. He is proud she has completed her task and the lines of supply of bodies are on track again. He welcomes her to upper management and says the view is better here than in the basement. He pulls back a curtain and tells her she can see why he's not worried about her betraying him and escaping: She looks out the window to see they are on an island in the middle of what looks like the ocean. She agrees, yes, she can see there is little danger of her escaping."

Thanks to the break we get a long ""previously on"" to get everyone back up to speed.

We open on Fish peering out the window first at a helicopter and further away a boat. She walks through the hospital greeting patients warmly. She goes to a locked door and breaks the lock and calmly steps outside. She appears in no hurry.

Suddenly, a truck full of armed men pull up. The leader asks Fish what she's doing. She explains she is Dulmacher's new assistant and was just taking a stroll. He says she can do what she wants inside but can't come outside and he is the man who catches the poor souls who try to escape. She asks if there are many. He says the water does most of the work but he handles the rest. She says she didn't realize she couldn't go outside. He tells her if she makes that mistake again she will pay with her life. So, Fish was testing the security system.

She heads down to the basement and tells her old right hand man Kelly that she is hatching an escape plan and they are going to get off the island or die trying.

Fish goes to a group of the biggest, baddest dudes in the basement and explains she wants to bust out with her help. They wonder why them and not the others she has been friendlier with. She says things might go sideways out there and she needs stone cold killers at her side. She tells them about the boat. They wonder why not the helicopter? She asks if any of them can fly it. Silence. Her either, that's why the boat geniuses. Fish goes to steal the keys from the Dollmaker's office and he catches her almost red-handed. Behind her back she picks up a letter opener and claims she wasn't trying to escape. He says he will shoot her until she tells the truth. She shows him the letter opener but claims she wasn't going to kill him, she was going to kill herself to stop the nightmares from coming about what he might do to her. He says if she lies to him again he will turn her into an unthinkable creature and will bring her back from the dead if he has to.

She goes to her big guys and says it's time to go. She sends them out to the gate and goes back to get Kelly. Dollmaker says he knows she lied and is about to capture her when her original gang of friends from the basement attack him and put him down. Fish tricked the big guys into going to the gate and pulling the security team away from the chopper, which it turns out she can fly after all. The security team dispatches with the knuckleheads at the gate and get off one shot at the chopper before Fish flies away and hit her on the side but she manages to suck it up and keep flying.

Meanwhile, Cobblepot is on a mission of his own. He is trying to buy into what very much looks like a dump of an Italian restaurant owned by a battle axe named Lydia. Lydia does not want to sell at any price. He says everyone wants something. She says her granddaughter Antonia has hooked up with a devil: a musician. She wants her back. Oswald says she'll be back by Sunday Mass. He and his henchman Gabe make quick work of it, cutting off his fingers and sending Antonia back to grandma. She agrees to let Cobblepot be her silent partner. Gabe is confused as to why Oswald wants the place. He says it is where he is going to kill Don Maroni.

Jim goes to have lunch with Bruce. They make small talk in the library over comically large sandwiches that Bruce has made. Jim asks why he and Alfred lied about who attacked him. Bruce says he can't help him. Jim says he knows that Alfred has some kind of vigilante plan and that is dangerous for them both. Bruce tells him he understands but continues to stonewall him. He does look like he feels bad about it though.

Alfred is back up and about and clearly ready to go after Reggie. He wants to catch him in a bar with his pants down before he flees town. Bruce says he will go too. Alfred isn't having that but then he suddenly clutches his side. Someone should not be out of bed yet because when he puts his hand under his shirt it comes back bloody from him pulling his stitches.

As Alfred lies on the couch dozing, Bruce makes a list of gun ranges in the city and slips out. After visiting them all and not turning anything up, he hunts down Selina. She is confused why Alfred thought Reggie would be staying a few days at a gun range. Bruce doesnt know he just said ""shooting gallery."" Selina laughs at his naivete knowing that Alfred meant drugs and that Bruce needs to get out more often.

Selina and Bruce find Reggie in a flop house. They take his drugs to make him talk. He claims he didn't mean any harm he was just supposed to take some documents. He asks who sent him, he gives him two names including a woman named Mathis and a man named Bunderslough. He said he wanted to know what Bruce knew and was scared but that he should let Alfred deal with it. They are still holding his drugs on the window ledge. He tells Bruce not to judge him for his vices and says Bunderslough will come after him and there's nothing he can do to stop them, and they are just silly little children and threatens to tell on them. He leans out the window to grab his drugs. Bruce clearly wants to push him out the window but can't so Selina is the one who does it, killing him.

At the precinct Jim is approached by a uniform cop about a cold case, a brutal murder of a woman named Grace Fairchild. He says he and some of the other younger guys have been watching him and know he is serious about cleaning up the GCPD and want to help and he thinks this case will be a good one.

Jim goes to pick up Lee for dinner and she looks at the case file. Grace was killed in her neighborhood and there are no leads. Lee points out that there are several speakeasies in that part of town that are easy to miss unless you're in the know. Jim says he will check it out. The photos are awful and she says she is glad he is looking into it. Jim appeals to Harvey for help who, of course, complains a bunch, mostly that Jim is doing this for ambition not justice, and then gives in and helps. Nygma gives them a list of speakeasies and at the last one they find a bartender who remembers waiting on Grace, mostly because her date was hot.

We flash to Grace on the date sitting where Harvey and Jim are standing. The guy is attractiveplayed by Milo Ventimigliaand he's got a good line. She asks why someone so attractive is single and replies that what he wants scares women away. She asks what he wants. He says it's cheesy but what he really craves is unconditional, intense, real love. She totally falls for it and goes back to his amazing loft apartment with him. What she doesnt notice while she is looking around is he has some kind of dungeon in a room whose door he quickly shuts. She is impressed with the place and he claims he hasn't brought many women back there lately and she calls herself lucky and says she'd be willing to stay for the night.

We flash back to the present and Harvey and Jim know this was the place she disappeared and both now seem determined to find her.

Nygma turns up with a photocopy of a missing piece of evidence from the crime scene. It is a picture of a broken heart and Bullock freaks out. He pulls Jim aside and says it is the calling card of a serial killer they gave up hunting long ago because whenever they would investigate, someone close to the cop investigating would have a loved one murdered which is why no one has been stupid enough to investigate. They call him the Ogre and he has killed at least a dozen women and his profile is wealthy and educated. Harvey calls it the GCPDs little secret. Harvey wonders who the cop was who gave him the file but Jim doesnt see him.

In another flash to Grace's captivity we learn that all of this is true. His name is Jason and he kept her shackled in his house, but one night when she overcooked dinner, he killed her. But first he took her picture and put it with at least 12 other women. He tells her not to worry because he knows he will one day find true love. Yikes! He wasnt kidding about being intense.

Back in the present they find the cop and he confesses that Loeb put him up to it, to appeal to Jim's ambition and get him to take the case. Loeb clearly wants the Ogre to kill someone close to Gordon. If he keeps investigating Lee could be in danger but he tells Harvey he has to keep investigating. He calls her and leaves a message to call him right away. He confronts Loeb in the precinct and tells him once he gets Ogre behind bars hes going after Loeb. He tells him hes done."

The noose is tightening all over Gotham, both literally and figuratively.

Nygma

Good old Ed Nygma gets his own storyline tonight. He goes to profess his feelings for sweet Kris Kringle only to discover her making out with odious Officer Doherty. The cop is apologizing and she is forgiving him. He derisively greets Nygma as ""Riddle Man"" on his way out of the records room, where Nygma has come to get old murder files related to the Ogre. He sees bruises on Kristin's arm and realizes that Doherty is hurting her. She tells him it's none of his business.

Undeterred he goes to Doherty in the squad room and threatens him, saying he must not hurt Kristin. Doherty of course thinks this is an empty threat. (We also learn that poor Ed is a virgin.)

The threat was not empty, however. Nygma stakes out Kristin's house and when Doherty arrives he confronts him in the street. Doherty punches him in the gut bringing him to his knees, Nygma responds by stabbing him. A lot. Like, many, many times. He then looks at the knife and mutters ""Oh dear! Oh dear!""

Cobblepot

Things aren't improving in terms of patronage at the nightclub but Gertrude Cobblepot is enjoying herself.

Penguin excuses himself from his mom to meet with a man about a thing. That thing is killing Maroni. The would be hitman balks that Falcone would never approve of this. Penguin says he thinks he can make him see the light and they set up the deal.

Unfortunately, Maroni himself shows up later and starts sweet-talking mom Gertrude. They sit and talk and drink much to Penguin's consternation. Until finally Maroni asks if this is all an act or if Gertrude is really this stupid. He says her son is not just a nightclub owner he's a cold-blooded psychopath who has killed people. She freaks. He grabs her head and asks when she realized she gave birth to a monster. Penguin is incensed and says Maroni will pay. Maroni, throwing a wad of cash on the table, says maybe he will or maybe Penguin will end up in the bottom of the river.

Later he tries to comfort his mom at home by saying Maroni has a strange sense of humor. She says she's no bumpkin and if he lies to her now he will break his heart. He lies and says he's a nightclub owner. She takes to her bed in tears.

A flower delivery guy shows up with roses for Gertrude from Sal. Penguin freaks and tells him to tell Maroni that this is over, the killing room is waiting and he is a dead man and smashes the flowers and vase to the floor. He then thinks better of this and tells the guy he'll tell him himself and then kills the delivery guy with a shard of glass from the vase. Gertrude calls out about the noise. Penguin says it's a neighbor who needs help taking out the trash and he drags the body away.

Bruce and Selina

The episode opens just after Reggie's murder by Selina and Bruce is freaking out asking why she did that after they got the information they needed. She said he was going to go to his boss and knew he wanted to do it but didn't have the guts. She tells him to man up, essentially and asks what's next. He says they need to get close to the Wayne Enterprises employee Reggie told them about Sid Bunderslaw. They agree to go to an upcoming Wayne charity ball where he will be and Selina will lift his keys so they can open his office safe and, hopefully, find incriminating evidence.

When Bruce tells Alfred he's going to the ball with Selina, Alfred assumes that puberty is finally kicking in. Bruce lets him think this since he can't tell the truth. But he does ask Alfred about how he had to kill people in the army. Alfred says he did and that it was necessary. He also cautions Bruce to careful at the ball. Bruce has Alfred have dress shops send over gowns and shoes to Barbara Kean's house for Selina to wear.

They arrive and Barbara is amazed, grabbing the bags saying they have a lot of work to do. It turns out quite nicely because when Bruce shows up in his tux, she looks beautiful.

They head to the ball and everyone is staring at him and Selina is confused.""Well, I am Bruce Wayne,"" he says. They talk about Reggie's death more and says that there's a line, and he will never cross it. She says she would do it again and it wouldn't bother her.

They spy Bunderslaw and as Bruce distracts him. Selina pockets the key. Mission accomplished.

Gordon and Bullock

Gordon goes to Lee and explains the whole story about the Ogre and says he wants her to get out of Gotham because he's not giving up his investigation. Lee says she's not going anywhere and will help him fight. She also wryly notes it took a serial killer for him to say he loved her.

Jim and Harvey go to the first detective who investigated the Ogre-- his wife was killed and he worries for his daughter-- and they guilt him into giving up some of his original investigative info.

This takes them to a plastic surgery practice where the first woman was killed. They figure he must've been a patient and this was his first stab, so to speak. The doctor won't give up any info and so they head off to get a warrant. But as they leave they notice a car that was also outside the precinct, the Ogre has been tailing them. He nearly runs them down in an alley.

Later he calls Jim and tells him not to believe his own press about how he's a rising star in the GCPD and this is his only warning to call off his investigation.

Not only does he not do this, he calls a press conference-- kissing Lee out in public beforehand--and announces his investigation to the world. The Ogre doesn't like this.

They get the warrant and learn that the dead girl came to the clinic by way of an old, monied Gotham family.

They go to the woman's house but a man is there in the midst of hanging himself. (It's Niles from ""The Nanny""). Harvey goes upstairs and finds the rich old woman very, very dead in her bed for quite some time.

The question the suicidal man and it turns out that he was the old woman's butler. He had a son who was severely disfigured -- such that his wife, the boy's mother left them when he was a baby. The boy grew up in this rich old lady's house and began thinking that he was her secret son. She indulged this fantasy until one day he went to her and demanded to be acknowledged and put in her will. She then revealed that she had just been playing along, that it was all a joke and certainly no one could love someone who looked like him. So...he killed her. His father, the butler, helped cover up the killing-- leaving the dead woman in her bed for over a decade-- and using her money to bankroll his son. He said his son made one mistake and cannot believe Gordon and Bullock's claim that he seduced and killed a dozen women and then shows them a picture: the plastic surgeon did a very good job because the Ogre was indeed very disfigured.

They take the pictures back to the plastic surgeon who admits he did the work and gives them a name but the Ogre is not using either one of his possible names. The surgeon did give them a sketch, however.

As Harvey, Jim, and the Captain brainstorm Jim has a realization. When the Ogre said the thing about him being a ""rising star"" he was quoting a newspaper article that had an accompanying picture of him and Barbara.

He rushes to her place but Selina says she is not there, she saw her leaving the ball with some guy. He shows her the sketch of the Ogre and she confirms it was him.

Barbara and the Ogre

Barbara is making all kinds of bad decisions. First she meets the Ogre at a bar and is sufficiently charmed enough to take him back to her place. He tells her that she isn't what he thought she would be. He don't know the half of it.

While her back is turned he unfurls his knife but when she tells him that she doesn't have a boyfriend he puts it away and leaves, rather abruptly. (He wants to hurt someone close to Jim and she no longer is.) Which is no shock to Barbara because she has literally just finished telling him that when most people get to know her they run screaming away.

He decides however, that he is intrigued by this duality in her and after Jim makes his big investigation announcement he seeks her out at the Wayne ball. As they dance he tells her that he, like her, is one person on the inside and another on the outside. He gets very intense and she tries to pull away but he won't let her. He tells her he has transformed himself and he wants to transform her and asks if she's tired of playing games and hiding. She says yes. He whispers in her ear.

He takes her back to his place and she asks about the closed door. He tells her to see for herself. She walks into his gleaming killing room. He walks up behind her and caresses her shoulder.

(Alas, no update on Fish.)"

Jason/The Ogre and Barbara

We open on the pair the morning after what sounds like an eventful night. He has breakfast plans, she wants to leave. He said they had fun and he asks her to stay. She tells him he doesn't have to do this and they shouldn't pretend it's more than it is. He says he's not pretending and wants her to stay. She says no and he stops her. He says he was pretending but not in the way she thinks. He says the night they met he was going to kill her. She says this isn't funny. He says then he saw the real her and he realized she was the woman he'd been searching for. She says he's lying. He commands her to stay and have breakfast. She knocks him off and runs for the door but it is locked. He throws a hood over her head and says he will do it the hard way.

As she hangs from the ceiling of his torture room, in cuffs and gagged, he explains about his first kill and how he thinks she may be his soul mate but he'll need her help figuring it out.

He removes her gag and she spits on him. He asks her questions and says he wants their relationship to work but she is uncooperative and slaps him. She says Jim will find her and he slaps her and says not to mention his name again. He hands her a drink, claiming it's water. She chugs it. He tells her he loves her like no one ever has and tells her to not try to escape and come take a look at something. He shows her his Polaroids of all his victims noting he had to ""kiss a lot of frogs."" She asks if he killed them all here in this room. He says yes. She faints. He tells her not to worry, he will set her free and that she is ""the one.""

He wakes Barbara up on the couch. She cries as he holds her in his lap. He tells her there's no need to cry. She says he's going to kill her. He asks her if she wants him to. She says no. So he asks her to tell him who to kill. She's confused. He says he sees her truth and wants to set her free. She says that making him murder someone is insane. He says she'll learn and to tell him who to kill or he will kill her right now. She says she can't. He holds a knife to her throat and repeats the question. She shakes her head yes and whispers in her ear.

Jim and Harvey

Lee checks in with Jim at the precinct. He thinks she may be still alive since her body hasn't been found. Lee tries to convince it's not his fault. He says he knowingly put Lee in danger but feels bad that he didn't even think of Barbara and whatever happens to her is on him.

Harvey brings in a kid who claims he doesn't know anything but has been bragging he does. They show him the sketch and the kid says he never saw him before. But then tries to bargain in the theory that maybe he does know something. Jim threatens to beat the kid up and he gives up wear Jason/the Ogre worked, an underground sex club called the Fox Glove that moves around. Jim says he has no choice but to talk to Penguin to find it.

He shakes Penguin down, offers him another big favor, and gets the info and invitation.

He heads back to the precinct and gives Harvey the invite in order to get in and bust them and then Jim will head in and they can squeeze the owner.

Harvey heads into the party at the club. It's an ""Eyes Wide Shut"" kinda deal with people in masks and bondage gear and costumes. He looks around for clues I guess. A woman onstage announces the night's main attraction, some kind animal act that we don't see. Harvey pulls out his badge and announces himself telling no one to move.

Jim talks to a hooker named Sally working the party who had a run in with the Ogre 9 years previously that left her with a huge facial scar. She doesn't know why he let her go but it was before he started killing so they venture he was working up the nerve. She gives them a lead on a location and asks them to kill him, not arrest him. Jim says he will.

Harvey and Jim find the Ogre's apartment and his kill room. He and Barbara are not there. Jim can still smell her perfume in the room. The phone rings in the room, it is, of course, the Ogre. He tells him Barbara is safe, safer than she was with Jim and he'll see him around. They deduce from background noise that he is headed upstate to her parents' mansion. He kills her parents and says he's doing it for her.

Jim and Harvey arrive and they are already dead. Barbara walks into the living room in bloody clothes as her parents dead bodies sit together on the couch. She is in shock and wonders what he is doing there. The Ogre knocks out Harvey who falls down the stairs. He attacks Jim from behind and they fight as the Ogre tries to stab him. He gets up and holds the knife to Barbara's throat. Jim trains his gun on him and tells Barbara she will be okay. The Ogre says he will slit her throat. Barbara asks him to leave them alone. Harvey approaches from behind and distracts him and shoots him in the head. Barbara is good and freaked out, asking if he is dead. Jim says he is and it's going to be okay.

He gets applause back at the precinct house where he apologizes to Lee, who tells him his sense of mission is part of why she loves him. She admits she was scared Barbara would get hurt and that he would blame himself and that their love would die, she says her concern was selfish. He says if he had to do it again he would protect Lee first. They kiss.

Nygma

Nygma awkwardly rolls two trunks through the precinct into the morgue. Inside are Doherty's body parts. He looks at it and says ""no body, no crime.""

He is about to dissolve the body when Kristin Kringle knocks on the door looking for a file. She walks in and sees the body parts and is aghast. He says the man died in a factory accident. She wonders how he can do this job. He says it's key to have a sense of humor. She asks if he's seen Doherty. He says he hasn't and shows her out.

Nygma speaks to Doherty's skull, ""alas, poor Yorick""-style trying to figure out what to tell Kristin about where he went. He considers a goodbye letter and then pounds the skull to dust.

Kristin Kringle reads the letter ""from Doherty."" She wonders why she keeps picking creeps. Nygma pushes the letter into a file where you can only see the first letter of every line and it reads ""Nygma."" He giggles.

Bruce and Alfred

In the study Alfred hands Bruce a letter that came by messenger. Bruce thanks him. Alfred is off to ID Reggie's body. Bruce asks if he wants him to come. He says no and is confused why he would off himself. Bruce says he heard he fell out a window. Alfred doesn't believe it and says he wants to give him a proper send off and leaves.

Bruce opens the letter and it has the key from Selina with a note saying she hopes what he find what he seeks and to be careful.

Bruce heads to Wayne Enterprises and while on a tour he asks to use the restroom. He pulls the fire alarm on the way. He sneaks into Bunderslaw's office and opens the safe. It is empty.

Bunderslaw walks in and says he's been expecting him ever since his ""friend"" borrowed his key. Bunderslaw closes the safe. Bruce simply states that Bunderslaw hired Reggie to kill Alfred. The man counters that he hired him to look into what Bruce knew and didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.

He sits at his desk and smiles and says he told the board that Bruce was a special boy and would need the ""talk."" He admits that Wayne Enterprises is a multinational corporation that maximizes the bottom line at all costs and that Bruce's father-- like his father before him--agreed with this sometime unscrupulous approach and that Bruce will eventually get on board too and live the life his parents wanted him to. Bruce does not believe this.

Bunderslaw approaches him, threateningly, and says he begs him to reconsider. Lucious Fox-- our first meeting-- enters and says there is a PR rep looking for Bruce. Bunderslaw says to reunite him. At the elevator Lucious tells him to keep his face neutral since there are cameras-- that he installed-- everywhere. He tells Bruce that his father was a good man, a stoic, who kept his best self hidden and that the company did not know who he really was. So now, Bruce has an ally. Lucious wishes him good luck.

Back in the study Bruce confesses about Reggie and Selina and Bunderslaw and his empty safe and his encounters at Wayne Enterprises and what he said about his father and grandfather. He is clearly wrestling with this. Alfred says his father was a good man. Bruce says even good men have secrets.

Bruce cuts a picture of his father's head out and places it on his evidence wall.

Penguin

Penguin has Butch place a pistol and machine gun under the bar at the place he just bought from the old Italian lady. She is hosting a party for Maroni that night and that is when he plans to have him killed. He is excited the day has finally come.

Penguin's contract killer checks in to make sure everything is set for the Maroni hit. Penguin instructs him to say something special to Maroni before the kill. The killer notes he never understands the whole final words before the killing thing but he'll do it.

We cut to Maroni meeting an old mob pal who just got of the joint and they are celebrating at Penguin's new place.

The killer shows up with a ""gift"" from Falcone and a message from Falcone that it's just business. Then the guys pull out the guns planted in the bar but they are empty/jammed. Maroni can't believe Falcone would do this and plans to send a message of his own back and kills them both.

This news gets back to Penguin at the club through Butch. He doesn't seem nervous. Butch realizes he knew, he set him up. He took the firing pins out of the guns. Butch says he could've had Maroni dead. Penguin says he'd still be under Falcone's thumb, this way he will be free since Maroni is out for blood.

Falcone receives a box with the severed head of his lieutenant-- the one Penguin had try to ""kill"" Maroni. Moments later Maroni's men open up on three separate Falcone businesses. The mob war is on.

We cut to the Penguin giggling gleefully."

Cat is warming her hands over a trash can fire with some others when she sees a boat approaching the shore with Fish Mooney standing at the bow. She comes ashore and warms her hands and says ""Good morning, child"" to Cat. Cat notes they ain't children and it ain't morning. Fish says it will be soon, a brand new day.

We cut to two weeks later. Bruce is pacing the study and looking at a photo of his dad. He smashes the frame. There is nothing in it. Alfred wonders if Bruce is still searching for secrets. Bruce says he is. Alfred says if his dad had a secret life then he would know about it. He says he worked hard right in this room. Bruce says he remembers he wasn't allowed to come in, and the door was always locked. Bruce asks why. He starts getting agitated and he says he knows his father's secret is in this room.

Falcone shows up to the docks in a limo. He opens a nearby chicken cage and takes out the chicken, and he greets Fish and says he likes her style. A motorcycle roars up and a man with a shoulder RPG blows up Falcone's limo.

Back at the precinct, the jail cell in the center of the room is filling up. A uniform salutes Jim as he walks by. Jim tells him that he's the walking dead here and will soon be fired after the shooting dies down so he shouldn't salute since it makes him look like a rube.

Jim goes to see Lee and Barbara in the morgue. She looks better and says she is. Jim calls Lee, Dr. Thompkins and she calls him ""Detective."" Lee says she's healthy. Barbara says she didn't want to leave without saying thank you. Lee says she needs to do trauma counseling. Barbara wants Lee to do it since she likes her and can talk to her. After some reluctance Lee agrees. This makes Jim uncomfortable.

Harvey reports that Falcone's car got blown up and he's in the hospital and he will be dead soon, and that people inside political circles are switching allegiances to Maroni. Jim is incredulous at this.

Across town, Falcone wakes up in the hospital. He's cuffed to his bed. Penguin and Butch arrive with flowers and a great big machine gun. He's happy to see Penguin and thinks he will help him get out, since Maroni's men will be there soon. Penguin says he knows and he came to say goodbye. He admits it was him that started the war. He pulls a scalpel from a drawer. Falcone asks why. Penguin says it's nothing personal, since Falcone has been a wise mentor and friend, but business must come first and he is going to take his place and be the king of Gotham. Falcone is incredulous at that and says Penguin will burn in hell. Penguin says ""You first"" -- and is about to slit his throat when Jim shows up and arrests them for attempted murder. Jim cuffs Penguin to the radiator.

Penguin asks to be released and to be on the winning side. Falcone says if he dies now, Gotham will fall apart. Jim asks if he can pull Gotham back together. Falcone says he can, he just needs to two days in his safe house. Penguin says Maroni's men are on the way and they don't like Penguin either, so he needs to uncuff him. Jim calls Harvey and floats the plan of getting Falcone out of there and asks for help. He says Falcone is the best bad man they've got. Harvey says he's not thinking straight because of Barbara. Jim says he's done in this town anyway so what does he have to lose. Harvey says ""Your life."" Jim hangs up.

A big thug arrives and wonders why Jim is there since he thought the fix was in with the cops. Jim tells Falcone he's doing this for the city and if he didn't think he's going to take back control he'd let him die. Falcone understands. Penguin reminds Jim he owes him a favor.

The thugs arrive and Loeb is with them. Falcone pulls out a switchblade, Jim says not to kill Penguin and Butch. Jim tells Loeb he is a disgrace and he hopes to see him behind bars or dead soon. Loeb says hope is for losers and leaves. The shooting starts and Jim is severely outgunned but he still makes it happen, double-fisting a pair of pistols. Harvey shows up and Jim says they have to take Penguin and Butch too since he arrested them. They hop in an ambulance and take off with Maroni and his men shooting at them. Maroni is not happy.

Bruce and Alfred have systematically torn up the library and have found nothing. Alfred wonders what exactly he's looking for. Bruce says when he finds it, he'll know.

Jim and Harvey and the criminals show up at a warehouse that is a safe house for Falcone. Falcone claims they will be safe there and suddenly, Cat and Fish and her army show up. Fish has a bejeweled mohawk. Fish sees the look on their faces and admits that sometimes she even astonishes herself.

At Barbara's apartment, Lee and Barbara talk about her parents' death, and her nightmares that the Ogre is coming for her.

Fish pulls Butch to the side, so happy to see him. He is not quite himself and she can tell. She gets a call from Maroni and reports she is alive and well and that they need to talk since she has something he wants.

Penguin, Jim, and Falcone are tied and Cat watches over them. Falcone tells Jim he still has his knife in his sock. Jim asks what she's doing there. She says just chilling. He notes he's kind of jammed up. She has no intention of helping them because they kinda, sorta know each other, since this is the coolest gig she's had.

Fish addresses the three of them and Butch is free, looking nervous and guilty. Fish says Maroni just told her she could have all her territories back if she gave him the head of Falcone. Butch tells her he needs to go to lie down. Fish asks Penguin what he did to Butch. He tries to speak and she says they will all die a painful death except Harvey, with whom she's still cool. Cat asks how she's going to kill them and Fish hugs her and says she loves this girl.

Barbara and Lee continue what appears to be an epic session, night into day. Barbara notes how the Ogre saw through her and how it was scary but thrilling. She says she was way more scared of Jim the first time they went out, saying he was so stern but turned out to be sweet and never laid a finger on her. Barbara asks if Jim ever hits her. Lee wonders why she thinks he would ever hit a woman. Barbara says she heard they were dating. Lee says it's just been a few dates and is sorry if that makes her uncomfortable. She says no, he's one of the good guys. Lee can tell something weird is up. Barbara asks if Lee is hungry and goes to make her food.

Maroni shows up and hugs Fish, and is delighted to see Penguin and Falcone strung up. Penguin begins to plead to them not for his life but Falcone's, because if Maroni kills Falcone he will kill Fish and he says he still loves Fish. Maroni says he wouldn't do that. Penguin asks what need he would have for a rival. Maroni notes Fish isn't a rival because she's not a boss, but an underboss. Fish bristles and notes an underboss takes orders and she does not. He tells her to relax and calls her ""babes."" Then she really starts to smolder and tells him not to call her that. They start to fight. (God, Penguin is good, real good.) He asks her to tell him what she is. She says ""What we are Sal, are partners."" He says fine, ""I'm partner number one, and you're number two."" She agrees to this, reluctantly. HE calls her babes again and says it will be the last time. Maroni addresses his men and Fish's, and says when Falcone dies a new day begins, and they will rule Gotham and whip the town like a rented mule. Then he says to Fish, ""right babes?"" She shoots him right in the head. She then says, ""I am relaxed."" Everyone is freaked out and suddenly the shooting and fighting starts. Harvey cuts Jim, Penguin and Falcone free and they take off with Butch.

Wow, Lee and Barbara's session is still going and it's night again. They are now having cake and coffee. Lee tries to get her to open up about what actually happened to her with the Ogre. Barbara says Lee is a nice lady so she's not sure she wants to go there with her. Barbara asks if Jim has told her that she loves her, and Lee lies that he hasn't. Barbara says she knows Lee can feel it coming and asks if Lee loves him. Lee tries to get her back on track.

Jim, Falcone, and Harvey are on the run and Jim says they need to get to 7th Avenue and can be safe. Jim notes Maroni's death was a lucky break of sorts. Falcone, however, has had a change of heart. Although they were previous in agreement that he was the best worst option, Falcone now says he wants to leave the business and has a place down south where he can hide. He apologizes to a once again incredulous Jim. He says he knows he is letting Jim and the city down but he's got to go. They make a run for it and get themselves inside a truck. Harvey asks if Falcone has any work for some beat up old cops at his beach house. Falcone says he does. Then Cat and a bunch of Fish's men discover them and bring them back to Fish.

Harvey compliments her on stopping the show. She says Maroni vexed her. She says she knows it was crazy but the battlefield is in flux and he could be looking at the new queen of Gotham. Falcone says he's out. She wonders if this means she doesn't have to kill him and wonders if he planned to go down south and retire, and he admits that was his thought. She says ""nice thought."" Then Penguin shows up with a machine gun and opens fire, killing lots of people. Fish gets away up some stairs and Harvey, Jim, and Falcone peel out in a car as Penguin chases Fish.

Barbara finishes telling Lee her story with the Ogre, getting to the part about her parents and how he told her to talk to them about her childhood issues and how they never nurtured her self-esteem and they chipped away at her soul trying to make her disappear. She said they had no clue who she is. She says even when she was killing them they didn't understand. Lee says Jason killed them. Barbara says nope, she killed them, stabbing them several times and then slitting their throats.. She is obviously still disturbed. And then she pulls a knife on Lee who takes off running. She locks herself in the bathroom and tries to call Jim as Barbara bust through the door like Jack Nicholson in the Shining. Lee breaks the mirror to have a weapon with a glass shard. This doesn't work and they have a crazy, amazing, hilarious fight that ends with Barbara choking and banging her head against the floor until she's dead just as Jim, Harvey, and Falcone walk in.

Meanwhile, on the roof of Falcone's warehouse, Penguin and Fish get into a battle of their own. Butch shows up but he doesn't know who to shoot and they both ask him to shoot the other. He shoots them both. Butch immediately apologizes to Fish but Penguin rises up and throws Fish over the side of the building in to the water as Butch looks on. Penguin looks at the city lights and begins shouting ""I'm the king of Gotham!!""

Kristin Kringle goes to see Nygma with the ""note"" from Doherty. She sees something strange in it, that the first letter of every line spells out his last name. He claims it's a coincidence. She is not convinced. He smiles as she walks away. And then when she is gone, he giggles. And then he starts talking and arguing with himself, mad that he had to leave a clue and tries to convince himself he has a chance. It is freaky, as we see him clearly having some kind of psychotic break.

Jim chats with Falcone on Barbara's balcony. They survey the scene. Falcone says he will miss Gotham. Jim asks if he will change his mind since Gotham needs him. Falcone says no, what Gotham needs is a powerful lawman who will grab the city by the neck and shake it and he knows in his bones that that man is Jim. He pulls out his switchblade and tells him that his father gave it to him. Jim is surprised they were that close. Falcone says, at one time. He says Jim's father was the most honest man he ever met, but he carried a knife. Falcone walks out.

Back in the library Bruce and Alfred have found nothing. Alfred says his father was a good man and he had no secret life. Alfred quotes Marcus Aurelius and Bruce realizes that's it, Aurelius was a stoic which is what Lucious called his dad. He grabs a copy of a book about Marcus Aurelius and finds a little device with a button on it. Alfred tells him not to press the button. Bruce does. At first they think it's just the stereo turning on his dad's beloved classical music. But then suddenly the fireplace moves backward from the wall. Bruce and Alfred peer at the opening and see a stairway built into the wall leading down.

And that's a wrap on season one!

With a note promising a handsome reward for taking care of the children. Eda and King take on the task, and send Luz off to the library to return Eda's overdue books.

At first in awe of the magical place, Luz is more shocked when she finds Amity Blight happily reading a story to some children! Though Luz attempts to use this opportunity to patch things up between her and Amity, things don't go so well. However, a few moments later she runs into Amity's twin siblings, Emira and Edric, who recall Luz from the recent Covention.

The two get Luz to join them in playing pranks around the library, before they are caught and ejected. The twins then ask Luz to come back and join them after-hours, with word that a celestial occurrence called ""The Wailing Star"" is supposed to affect the library in some way. Luz eagerly accepts, feeling confident that if she befriends the twins, eventually she can win over Amity. Unseen by Luz, Amity overheard what was being said.

Later that evening, Luz and the twins return after The Wailing Star passes overhead. This ends up allowing the books in the library to come to life when opened. As the three explore the library, Luz finds the book Amity had been reading, about a bookmaker named Otabin who longed for a friend.

As she looks through it, the twins mention how if one alters the pictures in a book, it'll affect what comes to life. The twins try to get Luz to deface the Otabin book, but she refuses, leading to them doing it for her.

The two then lead Luz to the romance section of the library, where they reveal a secret room, which is where Amity goes for privacy. The twins claim they intend to steal their sister's diary and post pages around the Hexside school to get back at Amity for tattling on them.

Luz isn't so sure she should he helping them, but grows excited when she finds that Amity also is a fan of the ""Good Witch Azura"" series! It is then she accidentally finds the diary...just as Amity comes across them! While Amity chastises her siblings, she claims that Luz seems to be a bully, and takes off.

Separating from Edric and Emira, Luz tries to change Amity's mind, when the altered form of Otabin appears, and attempts to sew Amity into a book. Luz attempts to fight back, but is accosted by the creature.

Amity and Luz manage to escape briefly, before Amoty breaks free of her bindings, and takes down Otabin. Conjuring up an eraser, Amity gives it to Luz, who erases the defacing in the book, returning the character to normal.

As the sun rises, the two finish cleaning up the mess, and Luz loans Amity her copy of book #5 in the ""Azura"" series, to make up for looking in her diary.

Luz then returns to the Owl House, where she finds that Eda and King are sleeping quietly with the Batqueen's babies. It is then that the Batqueen shows up, retrieving her children, and leaving a reward behind."

Mama's son, Vinton Harper (Ken Berry), shows up with his two teenage kids, Vinton Harper, Jr. aka Buzz (Eric Brown) and Sonja (Karin Argoud). Vinton tells Mama that he and his friend, Claude are in the business of raising chinchillas. He goes on to explain that they have ""hit a rough patch"". When she asks ""how rough"", Buzz chimes in and says ""pretty rough, we got kicked out of our house. Mama ends up agreeing to let them move in. Vinton can sleep in the basement, Buzz can sleep in the attic (after they clean it out) but Sonja will have to sleep on the couch. Vinton had already promised her Eunice and Ellen's old room, which is now Fran's writing studio. Thelma's second child and youngest daughter, Ellen, (Betty White) comes over and helps go through the items in the attic. She asks Mama how Fran feels about losing her studio and Mama admits that she hasn't told her yet. Ellen suggests that Mama just be honest and say ""Fran I've shafted you"". Just then Mama's next door neighbor Naomi Oates (Dorothy Lyman) is heard at the back door. She is upset because Mama's tree, which extends over her property and driveway, has once again dropped sap all over her car. Naomi comes in and her and Vinton immediately start flirting with each other. Naomi is very excited to find out that Vint (as she calls him) is moving in. Vinton admits he has had a crush on Naomi since high school. Naomi suggests they go out and leaves. As they are getting moved in Fran returns home and asks what is going on. Thelma tells Fran that it is her house and she can take in whomever she wants. Sonja comes downstairs with a file folder and asks Mama ""what should I do with this junk"". Fran had her back to them at this point. Sonja starts reading from the folder and Fran realizes she has the book she has been writing. Mama is shocked to hear that the portion Sonja is reading from is, in her words, ""smut"". Fran says she can't stay there because she would have no privacy. Mama tells her to do whatever she thinks is right. Fran begins to leave when Mama tells her she can't find an apartment at night. Fran agrees to stay the night and have dinner. She says she will leave tomorrow but then tomorrow won't work either. She ends up deciding to stay."

As King George VI's health worsens, Winston Churchill becomes Prime Minister for the second time. With King George too ill to travel, Elizabeth and Phillip embark on a four-continent Commonwealth tour. Party leaders attempt to undermine Churchill. With Elizabeth in a new role, Phillip tries to assert some power. Churchill wants to delay the coronation. King George's disgraced brother arrives. When dense fog cripples London for days and creates a serious health hazard, Churchill's inaction leaves him vulnerable to his political enemies.

Elizabeth rejects protocol by appointing Phillip to coordinate her coronation, but his ideas create conflict. The Duke of Windsor returns to London. Margaret and Peter come to Elizabeth with a request. With a royal scandal about to break in the newspapers, the Queen Mother intervenes. As the Soviets test the H-bomb, both Churchill and Eden have major health crises. Angry about her inadequate education, Elizabeth hires a tutor. Elizabeth and Phillip go on an exhausting world journey. Margaret takes over some of her sister's official duties and tries to liven things up.

As tensions with Phillip increase, Elizabeth spends time with her old friend Porchey. Churchill's portrait is painted for his 80th birthday. Margaret and Peter are reunited, but another obstacle stands in their way. Elizabeth is torn between her duty as Queen and her love for her sister. As Philip leaves for a long tour, Elizabeth makes an upsetting discovery. Prime Minister Eden wants to strike back after Egypt seizes the Suez Canal. Elizabeth feels disconnected from Philip. Eden copes with international pressure and ill health. An interview stirs up harrowing memories for Philip.

Palace insiders try to prevent a scandal that could reflect poorly on Philip. Eden faces censure from his cabinet and the press. When Elizabeth and Philip throw a grand party for their 10th anniversary, both Margaret and the new Prime Minister experience romantic tribulations. After Elizabeth makes a tone-deaf speech at a Jaguar factory, she and the monarchy come under public attack by an outspoken lord. A secret World War II document opens Elizabeth's eyes to grim realities about a family member. The Duke of Windsor campaigns to re-enter public life.

A letter from Peter Townsend spurs Margaret to make a bold proposal. Elizabeth has good news that causes complications for Margaret. Inspired by Jackie Kennedy and against her government's wishes, Elizabeth takes an unconventional approach to resolving an issue in Ghana. Philip insists that Prince Charles attend his Alma mater in Scotland and reminisces about the life-changing difficulties he experienced there. A salacious government scandal hits close to home for Elizabeth and Philip. Elizabeth retreats to Scotland for the rest of a difficult pregnancy.

A salacious government scandal hits close to home for Elizabeth and Philip. Elizabeth retreats to Scotland for the rest of a difficult pregnancy. While Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon visit the USA, the queen, at the bidding of Harold Wilson, asks them to make a side trip to Washington, D.C. to ask President Johnson for financial assistance for the United Kingdom. A horrible disaster in the Welsh town of Aberfan leaves scores of children dead, but when the Queen takes a week to decide to visit the town to offer solace to its people, she must confront her reasons for postponing the trip.

Left without a home by a political coup in Athens, Philip's eccentric mother, Princess Alice of Greece, is invited to live in Buckingham Palace by the Queen. While the Queen travels abroad to learn about horse training, unhappiness among the British elite with the devaluation of the pound involves Lord Mountbatten in a plan to oust Harold Wilson. Prince Charles is sent to Aberystwyth to learn Welsh from an ardent nationalist in preparation for the ceremony for his investiture as Prince of Wales. The 1969 moon landing occasions a mid-life crisis in Prince Philip, who thinks of the adventures he has missed as the Queen's consort.

Charles visits the exiled Duke of Windsor in his Paris chateau, only to find him very ill. But will the Queen make peace with her uncle before he dies? While Princess Anne dates her elder brother's polo rival Andrew Parker Bowles, Prince Charles falls deeply in love with Camilla Shand causing the Queen Mother and Lord Mountbatten to interfere. As her marriage falls apart, Princess Margaret finds solace in the arms of a much younger landscape gardener. The Queen and the nation celebrate Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. As Elizabeth welcomes Britain's first woman prime minister and Charles meets a young Diana Spencer, an IRA attack brings tragedy to the royal family.

Margaret Thatcher visits Balmoral but has trouble fitting in with the royal family, while Charles finds himself torn between his heart and family duty. After Charles proposes, Diana moves into Buckingham Palace and finds her life filled with princess training, loneliness and Camilla Parker Bowles. While Margaret Thatcher struggles with the disappearance of her favorite child, Elizabeth reexamines her relationships with her four children. As Thatcher's policies create rising unemployment, a desperate man breaks into the palace, where he finds Elizabeth's bedroom and awakens her for a talk.

On a tour of Australia, Diana struggles to balance motherhood with her royal duties while both she and Charles cope with their marriage difficulties. Grappling with mental health issues, Margaret seeks help and discovers an appalling secret about estranged relatives of the royal family. As many nations condemn apartheid in South Africa, tensions mounts between Thatcher and Elizabeth about their clashing opinions on applying sanctions. Charles is caught in a deadly avalanche, prompting both him and Diana to reevaluate their commitment to their troubled marriage. Amid a growing challenge to her power, Thatcher fights for her position. Charles grows more determined to separate from Diana as their marriage unravels."

An ""item"" for several years now, their possible nuptials is all anyone can talk about, and capturing it in photos is every media outlets' dream, which is why Erica and Tommy have gone to such great lengths to keep it secret.

We open on Erica and Tommy, in dark glasses and hats, being whisked away to their hotel suite. Once inside, the relieved couple quickly sheds their disguise to make love, discussing their impending wedding plans.

The next day, a worried Anthony shows up at THE Concierge with a photo in his hand. Someone got a shot of the celebrity couple during their love session. Erica and Tommy are upset, and Anthony is worried his hotel can't protect them from the press. He begs Angelica to help. If they can pull this off, anything she wants is hers. Angelica accepts.

While Sasha is hard at work researching the workings of the paparazzi, Angelica and Matthew make some additional security changes. But no sooner do they make the switch when Erica gets a call from her publicist saying an anonymous source has leaked that they're getting married in a few days.

Only Matthew and a few of his handpicked men now work security for the couple. In the hotel's spa, Angelica arrives to tell Erica about the additional changes that have been made. But Erica is starting to get nervous, not about the wedding, but about it being ruined by the press.

Later that night, Tommy is having his bachelor party at a hidden location. The party is in full swing, with beautiful strippers entertaining the male guests. While this is going on, he slips away to call Erica, who is having her bachelorette party at another secret place.

But the next day, Angelica is summoned to their suite, where she finds the couple distressed. Someone leaked pictures of Erica's wedding gown and the wedding cake to a tabloid, now confirming that they are indeed getting married. To make matters worse, some of Tommy's bachelor party was secretly taped and leaked onto the Internet. Although there's nothing very incriminating on it about Tommy, it still fuels the rumors that have been circulating for years about his playboy lifestyle. The couple is about ready to call the whole thing off and Angelica is starting to feel like a failure. But, to everyone's surprise, Sasha calmly suggests that they use all of this to their advantage.

Hours later, another video is leaked to the press that shows Tommy (we never see his face) making love with another woman in the shower of his suite. Upset, Erica storms out of the hotel for the airport, the paparazzi hot on her tail. Moments later, Tommy also leaves, jumping into his sports car. The press unwittingly chases the two decoys. Later that night, Tommy and Erica exchange vows in front of a small group of close friends in the privacy of Angelica's penthouse."

Kara is a divorced mother of two who gave up her dancing career to have a family, always wondering what might have been. Her girlfriend Sam strong-arms her into a girls weekend in Vegas, insisting that Kara needs a break from her routine. Kara drops her children off with her ex, then drives through the desert. Along the way, Sam calls to tell Kara her flight has been cancelled and she cant get there until the next day.

Actually, Sams been detained by a hottie whos waiting for her in bed. She shrugs off her guilt and hops back in the sack with him, saying that her girls weekend will keep.

Kara decides to make the most of her situation. Alone in Vegas, with no one looking over her shoulder, the possibilities begin to excite her. She goes to see THE Concierge. With Angelicas help, she gets an audition with a show, and in the course of becoming a chorus girl rediscovers her sexuality. While doing barre stretches with another female dancer, Kara and the woman exchange glances. Later in the dressing room, they relieve each other of their leotards and get to know one another.

Feeling guilty about Kara alone in the desert, Sam calls her. Kara insists shes having a good time, but lies to her friend, saying shes been reading by the pool and playing nickel slots. Sam cant bear it. She tells lover boy shes got to go to her friends rescueshe cant let Kara spend the whole weekend glommed onto the slot machines like some old retiree - so she takes off for the airport.

Meanwhile, Kara has her stage debut. Afterward, the dancer Kara was with earlier leaves with her date, a distinguished older gentleman. The handsome producer of the show sees that Kara is at loose ends, so he invites her out on the town. The two of them hit it off. They go all over town reenacting famous movie scenes. Kara dances in the fountain as in la Dolce Vita. She and the producer dance down the old strip in a recreation from a scene in Copollas One From the Heart. With the Mirage volcano going off behind them, Kara and the producer make love, hidden away in a dark alley.

The producer walks Kara back to her room and when she steps out of the elevatorhair wild, clothes askew, makeup blurred from all the sexual activityshe runs into the dancer, waiting outside her hotel room door. The producer is persuaded to come inside, and the three of them end up in the shower.

Then comes a knock at the door and Sam walks in. She sees the three people in towels and says, Whats this? You met these people playing nickel slots? The group breaks up laughing, and even Sam realizes that shed completely underestimated her friend.

Angelica watches Kara get into her taxi with Sam the next day, completely transformed. Radiant, Kara waves up to Angelica on the balcony, who returns the wave with a knowing smile. Angelica reflects on how a little adventure can resurrect a beautiful flower that was withering on the vine.
