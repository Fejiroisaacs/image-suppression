His old team-mates have been busy while he's been inside: Ash doing the flop, Stacie the dip, and Albert's just continued being Albert - but Mickey wants them back together. This will be Mickey's last score before he retires, so it's important he has the right team.



Danny Blue is a short-con artist, playing the cards, Find the Lady, Poker, anything to improve his skill. But he's desperate to do a long con. Whilst hanging out at London's renowned con artists' bar, Eddie's, he learns that Mickey 'Bricks' Stone is out. Keen to learn from the master, Danny sets off in search of the man behind the legend. However, despite his ability to talk the talk, Danny can't blag his way into Mickey's hotel room. He'll need a better in, if he's going to join this team.

""This crew is not about conning little old ladies out of their pension - they're strictly major league.""

Back at the hotel, Albert's got a mark. Peter Williams is a greedy businessman, keen on making money in shares. The con's a go. Albert ropes him, brings him in, introduces him to the insideman (Mickey) and it's all going to plan - until a knock at the door. It's Danny Blue.



Stacie and Albert are unsure. They're at a crucial stage in the scam; Williams has gone for the convincer and they can't risk losing him now, but Mickey lets Danny have his say. Turns out Danny's good - he's worked out they're doing 'the rag' and joins in, backing up Mickey's story. If he wasn't before, Williams is now convinced - he wants in. Danny's also in - he's made it in to Mickey Bricks' gang.



However, Danny comes down to earth with a bump when he's picked up by two police officers, who are investigating the team. Mickey and his hustlers are going down, there's nothing he can do about that, but the question is - does he go down with them? Danny's offered a deal; tell them everything he knows, or suffer like the rest of them. It's not the easiest of choice.



At the hotel, the culmination of all their work - Williams has arrived with a briefcase full of £50s. Danny arrives, tries to say something to Mickey but they're interrupted by armed police running in. Thing is, will Danny remember the advice Mickey gave him?

""First rule, Danny. Look after number one. If you don't, no-one else will...""

The perpetrator: one Frank Gorley (played by guest star Robert Pugh), a renowned thug, who happens to own a top London casino. Albert picked the wrong man to cheat at cards with. Gorley's a loner with no real vices. It'll be difficult wreaking revenge, but Mickey's not to be deterred. He sends Ash off to find an 'in'. ""No-one puts their hands on Albert.""

As Ash discovers, it seems their only way 'in' to Gorley is via his laptop. Danny, desperate to prove himself, following his monumental cock-up in an earlier pigeon con, determines to work something out. Using a deft combination of eye drops, sparkling water and car alarms(!), Ash and Danny not only access Gorley's computer, but download its memory too. It's only a couple more short moves before they discover that Gorley is a film fanatic.

""Showtime!""

Ash calls in several grifters - and favours, Stacie recreates herself as the new Audrey Hepburn and Danny asks Mickey for his promised chance to be the 'Insideman'. Once everything's in place, Mickey gives Danny his final words of wisdom: ""Eyes are the window to the soul Danny. Look in his eyes, think like he thinks""

Then, posing as American film producer, Jason Elliott, Danny tips up at Gorley's hotel in a flashy car, 'borrowed' in Mickey's own inimitable way. An intrigued Gorley can hardly wait to meet his movie hotshot guest, and invites Danny along for a drink that very night. He's soon introduced to Danny's fellow 'producers', Mickey and Ash, and between them they convince Gorley to invest in a quick scam, involving extras agencies. Having already read up about Jennifer Cole 'the new Hepburn of the movie world', Gorley's very excited to meet her on the set of her latest film. Of course - to any of us - Jennifer looks remarkably like Stacie in an elaborate costume, but Gorley's none the wiser...The deal goes ahead and Gorley makes £10,000 profit in half an hour.

It's not long before they pull him in for the big con - investing £200,000 in Jennifer Cole's big movie deal in Asia. Gorley's not keen at first but a quick 'reminder' from Danny of James Cagney's vaudeville training and Gorley's convinced.

The deal goes ahead and Gorley hands over a banker's draft for £200,000 - just leaving the team to 'blow him off'. As Danny prepares for his first 'shoot-out', everyone's nervous, but no-one has guessed quite how far Gorley's prepared to go to impersonate his screen idol, Cagney, and it lands one of the team in hospital with Albert.

However, revenge is ultimately sweet - but what is Albert's special surprise?"

His grifting instincts are right - Meredith's an ideal mark. She's unscrupulous, greedy and selfish, and a huge fan of artist Pier Mondrian, having just bought one of his paintings for £250,000. Mondrian famously went from picture-postcard paintings to abstracts some time after Picasso. As Danny explains to the team, IF a Mondrian painting were discovered in the Abstract style pre-dating Picasso, it would turn the art world on it's head.

""We fake the right painting, and all we gotta tell her is how many noughts we want on the cheque.""

It's an interesting proposition, but Mickey has other things on his mind. While he was in prison, Ash and Albert roped a mark and conned him out of £50,000. Only thing is, the mark was broke and now his factory's about to go into receivership. They're jinxed and - according to grifter lore - the jinx will only be lifted if they put things right. They need to find £50,000 NOW. Mickey decides not to tell Danny, and goes along with the art con for a while - to see if it has legs.

Certain his scam's a winner, Danny introduces Mickey to art journalist, Bea Watson, as someone with an interesting art 'discovery'. Mickey tells her there's no story, but this just intrigues Bea more.

""She wasn't interested until she thought I wasn't interested. Now she's intrigued.""

Art forger, Tip Jones, is a renowned conman, known for his inimitable forgeries but, disappointingly, Mickey, Albert and Danny find him in a vegetative state following an operation gone wrong. Ever-astute Albert isn't so quick to believe and whispers in Tip's ear he's got a job needs doing. It'll pay £100,000. Suddenly Tip's alert. He agrees to paint a new Mondrian pre-1902, but he's going to need an original work, if they want it done properly. Using a combination of flirting, good timing, glue and toilets, Mickey and Stacie manage to steal a Mondrian without anyone even realising it's missing. Tip begins work on the 'new find'.

Meredith Gates (played by Orla Brady) still needs to be hooked. Thinking he's a fellow art collector, she meets Danny at his 'import/export warehouse'. Gates agrees to match his £250,000 if the new Mondrian painting's proven to be genuine in initial tests.

It all goes to the wire, and there are a few surprises along the way. They just have to lift the jinx, and preferably without Danny realising.

""He hasn't sussed that we're just following a different set of rules to everyone else.""

What will he do when he does suss though?"

Maher 'has something' on Danny, which he'll hand over to the police unless Mickey helps him catch the bank robber who's been plaguing the bank for which he is now head of security.

""When the chance comes to lock horns with the great Mickey Bricks, it's too good an opportunity to miss.""""

Maher wants Mickey to befriend the robber, Sam Richards (played by Richard Harrington), then help catch him as he breaks into the London branch. Albert advises Mickey not to get involved - ""You can't outsmart him or out manoeuvre him, he knows every trick we do and more besides"". But Mickey agrees to the deal.

He thinks it best to tell the team it's just another job, not revealing exactly what's at stake, but asks Stacie to keep Danny out of the way for a while. Albert ropes Sam in, just like any other con and tells him how he knows a dodgy alarms man. Sam's hooked and before long, Albert arranges a meet - with Mickey.

Ash plays the alarms expert and, before long, Sam is telling them how he plans to break into the bank. He explains how his father died while he was just a child, something that rings true for Mickey. Moores Bank robbed his father blind in his hour of need and Sam wants to recover the money his father was owed, together with his priceless diamond.

""I know it sounds stupid, but this isn't about the money.""

There's a problem though: Moores' security system needs two people to override it - Mickey agrees to go in with Sam. The second problem: there'll be no way out.

Albert counsels Mickey that, in order to beat Maher, Mickey must tell the rest of the team what's at stake. He does. Danny can't believe that the job is all to save his skin. The team go at the bank job with a new vigour - they want to beat Maher (played by David Calder), save Danny and help Sam Richards, but can they do all three?

The night of the break-in: Mickey and Sam are in the bank and Albert arrives to collect the tape of Danny. Once Sam and Mickey make it into the vault, Maher rushes down to catch them both. But when he gets there - there's nobody in the vault, and no sign of a break-in.

Maher spots a CCTV camera and, finally, he begins to think about the possibilities. Has he actually taken on something - or someone - bigger than he is? Is it possible that Mickey and his team have achieved the impossible and conned him right under his nose?

Later, after Mickey and Sam have said their fond goodbyes, Mickey has one last surprise for Maher, the griftbuster..."

Katherine is perfect bait for the 'Congreve', an old con which targets bitter, rich women. Albert goes off to do his stuff, and rope her at an art class.

""When he was younger, Albert was the doyen of the 'Congreve'. He could sniff out a vengeful woman like a pig with a truffle.""

The team's desperate for a lucrative con, particularly Ash. Mickey's shocked to discover that Ash's ex-wife, fellow con artist June, recently suffered brain damage, whilst doing 'the flop' . Ash has been paying for her care bills in a nursing home, but his money is about to run out. Mickey tells Ash they'll all help to pay - after all, ""she's family"".

It doesn't go well at the art class. Katherine is rude, cold, and refuses to fall for Albert's charms. It's time for plan B - blatant sex appeal. Danny's obviously keen to give it a try(!) but the con requires experience, so it's up to Mickey to reel Katherine in. She's terrified of lifts, so Ash orchestrates the ideal situation: Mickey and Katherine in a lift, when it suddenly breaks down. The lift is out of action long enough for Mickey to break down Katherine's barriers and by the time they reach ground level, she's offering to take him out for dinner.

Over dinner, Mickey tells her the tale: he's setting up a spa business, to rival her ex-husband's. Katherine wants to help - she knows how spas work, what makes them special, and she also wants to impress Mickey. There's a real spark between them.

Meanwhile, the rest of the team go about setting things up - Danny's meeting architecture students, Stacie's arranging business space and Ash is designing a website. Katherine finally agrees to invest £100,000 in the new spa business but, when Mickey brings her the contract, she's changed her mind.

In the heat of the moment, when both are feeling vulnerable, Mickey breaks all the rules and makes love to Katherine. When Mickey goes to leave, he tells her he's a con man, there was never any spa for her to invest in. ""You were rich, bitter, angry, obsessed. You were ripe to be plucked."" Shocked, Katherine offers Mickey £250,000 to destroy her ex-husband instead - ""a rat to catch a rat"".

The team agrees that, if Stephen Winterborn (played by Ben Miles) is as bad as Mickey says he is, it's morally OK for them to go ahead. After all, they need the money. But how can they destroy Stephen? An embarrassed Danny has the answer. He's 'discovered' that prostitutes work at the spa. If this information were made public, it would destroy him, his business and his stock market flotation.

Stacie orchestrates a meeting with Stephen, then introduces him to her 'PR associate' - brilliantly played by Ash. Stephen's presentation is consequently doctored and it's just a case of waiting, then watching his very public downfall.

But during the launch party, alarm bells start ringing for the team. Slowly they realise that Katherine has conned Mickey into thinking that Stephen is the bad person, when it's really her! Katherine has been pulling the strings all along; not Mickey. Could it be that, on this occasion, the con man has been conned...?"

Fairground owner, Arthur Bond (played by Philip Jackson), is chuffed with his new star attraction, a bargain at a few thousand quid! Mickey and Danny are happy too - it's another easy con, another job done.

Onto their next mark: Anthony Reeves (played by David Haig), a greedy fat cat who's just got the cream with a golden handshake worth £½ million. A secret gambler and a weakness for prostitutes: the team have their 'in'. Reeves is the perfect bait for 'the wire'. But ...

""No-one's worked the wire in a hundred years"".

However, not a team to turn down a challenge, Ash sets up a fake gambling club ('the big store') where the races are delayed by a vital couple of minutes so they see the results before the punter. Fill the club with grifters posing as customers and who'd spot the difference?

Albert's already befriended Reeves through his gentleman's club, so it's just a case of offering him the bait. Enter Danny, as a rogue nephew with insider racing knowledge. A winning tip impresses Reeves and Stacie's killer charm as girlfriend 'Yvonne' soon has him chomping at the bit.

Time to reel him in. When Danny 'confides' that Yvonne, actually a high class escort, can provide names of the winning horse before a race is even run, Reeves wants in. Danny offers to show him his private gambling club, where the bets have no limits.

At the club, the team are all in place: Mickey's the Manager, Ash the man behind the counter, while Albert and Stacie keep tabs in the back office. The plan goes sweetly with Reeves winning £72,000 on a race. Danny and Stacie help him celebrate, but Reeves is cautious - he wants to try another race before betting big.

The team are forced to block him out. Danny takes Reeves back to the club, Stacie calls with the winner's name, but they run the race just as Reeves tries to place the bet. He's too late. Watching the horse romp home he can't believe he's missed out. Next day and it's time for the big one.

""It's a once in a lifetime opportunity, sir. It's now or never.""

Stacie makes the call to Reeves who bets £1/2 a million on the horse to win. When the horse only comes third she claims she told Reeves to place the bet not to win. He's distraught but it's too late to get his money back.

To add salt to his wounds, he's besieged by 'journalists' interrogating him about his golden handshake and gambling habit. Reeves makes a hasty retreat, a beaten (and broken) man.

As the team celebrate, gunshots are heard. It's Arthur Bond, demanding the London Eye money he was scammed. It's simple: pay up or get killed. They look from one to the other: any bright ideas?"

Continuing on, Herbert takes his dog into the nearby park and finds blood splattered on a tree. The dog sniffs at it and then runs off, and Herbert chases after it. It stops by the corpse of a young boy underneath a railroad overpass, and Herbert stares in shock

That night, detective Ralph Anderson drives to the crime scene where other police officers have already arrived. An officer, Tamika Collins, is questioning Herbert, and Ralph explains that he got held up in court. Tamika takes Ralph to the corpse, explains that it was Frankie Peterson, Joy and Fred's younger son. He tells her to have someone take Herbert home, and stares at the bloody corpse in horror. Yunis Sablo with GBI introduces himself and offers whatever help his department can provide. Yunis says that there are human teeth impressions on the wounds.

Later, Ralph questions Herbert, who says that he didn't see anyone going to the park. He describes the van but didn't see much. Herbert confirms that he didn't touch the corpse to see if it was still alive.

A few days later at home, Terry Maitland is making breakfast for his wife Glory and daughters Maya and Jessa. Terry talks about the Little League he's coaching and they all agree that his team the Dragons will win. Jessa tells Terry privately that it was brave of the families wanting to play, and Terry notes that it's been a few days since the murder and people want to see if they can push through.

Jeannie tells her husband Ralph that she has to work at the shelter. Ralph is lying on his bed, staring up at the ceiling in shock, He talks about how they trust their son Derek with the killer for two years, and Jeannie points out that Derek died of cancer and Ralph should focus on arresting the killer for what he has done. Ralph goes and says that hopes the killer resists.

The Dragons are at the baseball field playing, and Terry is coaching from the first base line.

Ralph gets an arrest warrant at the courthouse and leaves. Ralph remembers he and Tamika going to the Peterson house and Joy coming to the door. She stares at them and realizes something is wrong, that something happened to Frankie, she screams.

-----

Ralph meets with teacher Mary Moore. He questions Mary, who describes how she was leaving the grocery store at 3 pm and saw Frankie walking his bike past, his wheel chain broken. She tells Ralph that Terry pulled up in a white van and gave Frankie a lift. All Mary remembers about the van plate is that it was out of state, but insists Terry was driving.

As Ralph goes, he calls Tamika to get a copy of Terry's prints from the Board of Education.

-----

Ralph and his officers arrive at the baseball field and Ralph tells them to go in and read Terry's his rights so that everyone can hear, and then make sure everyone sees them cuff him. When one officer warns that it's against protocol, Ralph insists and to not use guns. Ralph then calls Tamiko, who is waiting at the Maitland house with more officers. Yunis arrives with a search warrant for the house .

-----

Ralph talks to Juney Moore, Mary's daughter, She tells him that that she was walking near the park and saw the white van. Terry walked out of the woods, his mouth covered in blood, and looked at Juney. When she asked about the blood, Terry claimed that he got hit by a branch. The girl is sure Terry was making it up because he had blood all over. Terry got in the van, waved to Juney, and drove off.

-----

Terry sends Trevor in to bat even though he hasn't got a hit all season, insisting that everyone plays. Glory stands up in the stands, and the two officers come over and arrest Terry for Frankie's murder. Terry apparently has no idea what they're talking about, and they cuff him and read him his rights. Everyone watches and some of them take photos on their cameras.

-----

The police find the van and take DNA and blood samples. They remove a flyer from under the windshield wiper. Meanwhile, Ralph meets with Claude Bolton, a strip bar bouncer at the Peach Crease and AA member. Claude says that Terry came into the bar at 8 on the night of the murder and asked to use the men's room to clean up the blood on his face. He asks Claude if there is a ""doc in a box"" in the area to get his nose cauterized, and Terry asks him to call him a cab. Terry confirms that he parked his van in the back and Claude assures him it will be okay there for a while.

Claude tells Ralph that Terry came out of the rest room wearing fresh clothing and describes them, including a belt with a horsehead buckle on. He hesitates and then says that Terry had more blood on the back of his jacket and it didn't jibe with him saying he had a nosebleed.

-----

The officers take Terry to Ralph's police car, and Glory runs after them and demands to know where they're taking her husband. Ralph tells Glory to let them take Terry away, and Terry calls to her to get their daughters and call their lawyer, Howard Saloman. The officers drive off with Terry and Glory goes back to the field.

Howie is practicing at a driving range when Glory calls him. She tells him that the police arrested Terry for Frankie's murder, and says that Terry wasn't in town the day of the murder. Howie figures the police have a search warrant for the Maitland house and tells Glory to drop the girls off at a friend's house. He then tells Glory not to let the police take anything but what's on the warrant, and to refuse to answer their questions on her lawyer's advice.

In the car, Terry tells Ralph that he was out of town when Frankie was killed. Ralph asks Terry if he ever touched Derek, and Terry is offended. Another officer, Don, asks him if there were other boys. Terry tells Ralph that he just ruined their lives and sits back.

-----

Ralph talks to a cab driver, who picked up Terry at the Peach Crease. Terry insists that she call her dispatcher and say that she picked him up, then has her take him to the Amtrak station to take the overnight to Dallas/Fort Worth. He didn't say anything else, and she didn't smell any alcohol off of him.

The surveillance cameras at the Peach Crease shows Terry talking to Claude and then him leaving later in fresh clothing. There's more footage of Terry at the Amtrak station, apparently making sure he was seen clearly by the cameras. Ralph and Yunis watch the footage, and Ralph figures that Terry is acting like he wants to be caught on tape. Yunis confirms there's no record of Terry buying a ticket, and Ralph wonders why Terry called a cab. He points out that everything Terry did after murdering Frankie was idiotic, and wonders what kind of criminal wants to get caught. Yunis suggests Terry wanted to be punished for what he did, but admits he doesn't buy it either. He asks if Ralph is going to cuff Terry at the game, and Ralph doesn't answer.

-----

Ralph watches Terry in the interrogation room through the one-way mirror. DA Kenneth Hayes comes in and tells Ralph that the DNA in the van matches Frankie and Terry has a rare blood type that was on the branch used to sodomize Frankie. Ralph wants Terry's DNA tying him to the murder, and Hayes and Ralph go in to meet with Terry. Terry refuses to talk without Howie present, and Kenneth asks him if he was out of town when Frankie was murdered. The suspect still refuses to talk, and Kenneth tells him that they can hold him for 48 hours without charging him and then they have to take him to the courthouse for arraignment.

Ralph suggests Terry help himself out by letting them take a DNA cheek swab. Terry still refuses to do anything without Howie present, and Ralph insists that he has a solid case. When Terry asks for his lawyer, Hayes and Ralph leave as Howie arrives. Howie goes with the two men, leaving Terry alone in the interrogation room.

Howie asks if it's a mistake or they've lost their minds, and Ralph insists that there no initial interview. The lawyer points out that Ralph arrested Terry in front of a hundred people without an initial interview or verifying his story, and Hayes says that the evidence they had was strong enough they didn't want to risk Terry running. Howie notes that they could have posted officers around the field and waited until the game was over, and asks Ralph why he did it. Ralph says that he had his officers arrest Terry because he couldn't have trust himself not to beat Terry. Ralph walks off and Hayes shows Howie the file on how Frankie was killed.

Glory drives home and Yunis shows her the warrant to search her home. She points out that there's nothing specific listed on the warrant, and Tamika says that it's at their discretion given the nature of the crime. The officers take her daughters' things away, and as Glory goes in, a man in a hoodie is among the bystanders, watching.

Howie, Hayes, and Ralph go back into the interrogation room and Howie tells them to lay out their case or he's going to the press and saying they ruined Terry's life without saying why. Hayes says that Terry's fingerprints were on Frankie, his bike, the branch, and the van. There were 70 prints in blood, several witnesses identified Terry, and the blood match. Terry says that it's a nightmare, and Hayes suggests that he end it by telling them why he did it. The suspect insists that he was in Cap City with two fellow teachers, at a conference for secondary school English teachers. Howie notes that Terry's alibi isn't convenient for Hayes, and Terry says that there were dozens of people who saw him. Howie warns that Ralph and Hayes are making a bad mistake by arresting Terry, but Hayes insists that there's no mistake and they'll have the DNA from the swabs to confirm Terry's guilt.

After four days have passed, Joy Peterson goes to the station and demands her son's body for burial. The officers lead Terry past, and Joy yells at him asking if he killed Frankie. Her other son Ollie holds her back. Terry is taken to prison and searched, and some of the prisoners recognize Terry as the child killer. Terry says nothing, and the guards lead him out.

After Frankie' service, the Peterson's hold a wake at their house. Ollie sits by himself while his parents Joy and Fred talk with the visitors.

A private detective working for Howie, Alec Pelley, calls the Babcock Hotel where Terry said he was staying and confirms Terry's alibi.

After processing, Terry refuses to go in a cell with the prisoners who recognized him earlier. The guard is unimpressed but his superior tells him to put Terry in a separate cell so they don't lose him. Once the guards leave, Terry moves out of sight of the other prisoners staring at him.

Hayes tells Ralph to question the two teachers Terry was with, and Ralph says that they've talked to one of them and he's confirmed everything Terry said. Ralph figures Howie already sent an investigator to the Babcock to get the security tape, and Hayes warns that what they have is inconclusive e.

At the Babcock security room, Alec goes over the security footage and spots Terry going into a gift shop. There's no surveillance camera in the shop, and the security chief says that there was a public-access camera crew covering the panel.

Joy, Fred, and Ollie clean up the food after the wake, and Joy looks at a photo of Frankie. She then takes Frankie's baseball bat and smashes the plates, screaming in fury and grief. Joy goes through the house, hitting everything in her path, while Fred and Ollie stay away from her. She finally drops the bat, sobbing, and collapses. She appears to go unconscious and Fred runs to the phone to call 911.

At 3 am, Glory wakes up and checks on her sleeping daughters. Jessa is sitting up on her bed, and Glory asks what the matter is. The girl is staring at her window, and yells that she will not when Glory interrupts her. Jessa tells Glory to tell ""him"" to get out of her room, and Glory says that no one is there and Jessa is dreaming. Her daughter says that ""he"" was saying bad things to her, and Maya comes in, hearing the noise. Glory assures her that her sister is having a bad dream and holds Jessa. Jessa insists that ""he"" was there and it wasn't a dream.

The next day, Alec calls Howie to say that he sent him a link, and tells him to look at it and tell Alec what he thinks. Howie looks at the video at the link and swears in astonishment. The video from the panel shows Terry asking a question, and Howie shows it to Hayes and Ralph. The time of the question is the same time that Frankie was murdered 70 miles away.

Later, Ralph tells Fred and Ollie that evidence clears Terry. Fred refuses to hear it, and Ralph sits with Ollie.

Hayes, Ralph, and Yunis discuss the case, and Hayes warns that juries rarely convict on fingerprint evidence. The witnesses won't stand up to cross-exam, and Hayes is starting to have his doubts about the DNA evidence. Ralph goes to the Babcock to find out for himself.

Howie and Glory meet Terry in prison and tells him that the charge was withdrawn. However, the lawyer warns that Terry will still be arraigned. However, Howie promises that by the time Terry reaches the courthouse, he'll make sure every reporter in the state has a copy of the video so Judge Landy won't deny Terry bail. Howie says that the video tape and witnesses clear Terry but he wants more physical forensic evidence from the Babcock proving Terry was there, even though it's unlikely given it was a hotel room. Terry suggests that there was something.

Ralph questions the bartender at the Babcock bar, but the man doesn't remember Terry drinking there. He goes over the security footage and sees Terry go into the gift shop, and talks to the owner. She was working during the conference and recognizes Terry. The owner points out an expensive photo book that Terry look at but didn't buy, and no one has touched it since Terry was there. Ralph buys the book and leaves with it, passing Alec. The two men know each other and casually greet the other. Alec knows about the photo book and Ralph admits that he has it, and Ralph admits that he hopes he doesn't find Terry's fingerprints on it.

Back at the station, Ralph lifts prints from the photo book and confirms they're Terry's. He and Yunis then shows them to Hayes at the DA's home and notes that they confirm Terry was at the gift shop. Hayes doesn't believe Terry was in two places at once, and Ralph admits that he had to log them into evidence. The DA says that Ralph sabotaged their own case, and Ralph tells him that if Terry is innocent then they're not done. He asks Hayes how badly he wants to win, and Hayes asks him how badly he wants to lose.

The next day, Ralph and Jeannie go to Derek's grave and wish him a happy birthday. Ralph says that he would do anything, and Jeannie understands that he can't get justice for Derek. His wife asks him if he really thinks Terry killed Frankie. Ralph admits that he doesn't know.

Back in his office, Ralph goes over the footage of Terry at the Amtrak station and compares it to the video from the panel. When the Terry at the station puts his hand on a wall, Ralph calls Tamika in. They realize that the Terry at station is giving them the finger,

Glory lays out the suit that Terry will wear to court.

Hayes goes over the case on his laptop.

Howie lies in bed and watches TV.

Ralph lies down in bed next to Jeannie.

A prisoner whispers to Terry, calling him a child killer and saying that blood cries for blood. He says that the next morning when Terry gets back from court, they'll be waiting for him. Terry lies awake, listening."

The guard refuses to remove Terry's manacles, and Ralph admits that he's there on his own. He tells Terry that the van with the New York plates is still bothering him, and Terry tells him that the last time he was In New York was 16 years ago for his honeymoon. Ralph explains that they back-checked Terry's movements over the last six months and couldn't find anything but a family vacation to Dayton that the Maitlands flew to and from.

The detective says that he's baffled by the conflicting evidence, and says that he has credible witnesses who saw Terry covered in Frankie's blood. Ralph figures that no one can explain it, and asks Terry if he had any physical or verbal contact with Frankie on the day of the murder. Terry says he didn't, and says that he didn't abduct or murder Frankie when Ralph asks. Ralph tells him that they're done for the night, and Terry says that when Ralph arrested him at the game, he asked him if he ever touched Derek. He tells Ralph that Derek was the best drag bunter he ever had, and had a lot of guts. The kids called Derek ""The Whiffer"", and Terry told them to stop. Terry taught him how to bunt and Derek never flinched. The other kids started calling Derek ""Push It', and Terry asks if Ralph noticed how confident his son was. Terry admits that he hoped he did touch Derek when he taught him the bunt. With that, Terry goes back to his cell.

The next day, mortician Craig Kohara shows Fred and Ollie two coffins, for Frankie and Joy. Kohara offers them a discount since they're buying two coffins.

Terry showers at the prison.

At the courthouse, a crowd gathers for Terry's high-profile quest.

Howie drives Glory to the courthouse.

A reporter questions Hayes and notes that he could be focusing so much on Terry that he's letting other suspects slip past. Hayes insists that Terry is guilty, and the reporter asks if he's running for governor. The DA insists that he only cares about bringing justice to Frankie's killer.

The prison guards bring Terry to the courthouse and lead him out. Many of the spectators boo, and Ralph takes Terry in as Howie and Glory arrive. A masked Ollie steps out, shoots two of the guards and hits Tamika in the leg, and Ralph shoots back, killing him in self-defense. Ollie's last shot hits Terry in the neck, and Ralph goes over and confirms Ollie is dead. Glory goes to Terry, who is bleeding out, and Howie yells for 911. Ralph comes over and checks Terry's wound, and has Glory put pressure on it. Terry whispers to Ralph that he didn't do it and it wasn't him, and a doctor arrives. Terry dies despite her efforts, and the man in the hoodie watches as the rest of the crowd scatters. After a moment, he walks away.

Later in the hospital, a doctor--Myron Lazar-- checks Ralph. Ralph says that he killed a boy, and the doctor makes sure Ralph is fine. Myron tells him to concentrate on his breathing and get it down, draws the curtain, turns off the lights, and leaves.

The police question Glory.

Jack Hoskins is out hunting when he gets a text saying he's needed back ASAP. Cursing, Jack loads up his truck and drives off.

Yunis visits Ralph, who is at home sitting in front of the fireplace. Ralph confirms that he's on administrative leave for two weeks and they've assigned him a trauma therapist. Yunis says that Tamika is laid up with a shattered bone from the shooting and worried about her unborn child, and Ralph wonders why he didn't keep her back. He wonders why he thought arresting Terry in front of spectators was the way to go, and Yunis tells him that he had his reasons. The GBI officer tells Ralph that they found out a boy had been stealing cars and ditching him, and the van was the first vehicle he took. The boy drove it from New York to Ohio, and Ralph remembers saying that the Maitlands vacationed in Ohio. All the boy remembers is that he left the van at a shopping mall parking lot.

At the Peach Crease, Jack tells a man at the bar, Ed Polk, about the vacation he gets and they called him back early. Polk doesn't care and Jack throws his drink on him. When Polk man comes at him, the drunken Jack kicks him in the kneecap, wedgies him, and punches him to the floor. The bouncers get Jack out, and the bartender buys Ed a drink.

Glory sits on her porch, and hears Jessa and Maya yelling at each other. Their mother goes to Jessa's bedroom and Jessa says that ""the man"" was there and then left. Glory calms Jessa down and gets her back into bed.

Ralph is up smoking, and Jeannie finds him. She remembers that it's been five years since he smoked, and Ralph describes a piece of blue paper he saw beneath the van's windshield wiper. Ralph says that he's going to go in the next day to check it out, and Jeannie reminds him that he's on leave and supposed to see a therapist. She asks him to lie next to him in bed, and Ralph lights up another cigarette.

The next day, Fred sits in his otherwise-empty house. He finally makes a rope out of torn sheets, ties one end to the bed, puts the other end around his noose, and tries to hang himself. A woman is jogging by and sees the bedroom window shatter as Fred kicks it in his death throes, and she yells for help. Down the street, the man in the hoodie watches and then leaves.

Ralph goes to the station and tells the clerk Mildred that he needs the keys to the evidence room. She lets him take them, and Ralph goes in and takes a photo of the blue paper from the van. When Ralph goes out, he sees Jack, who says that they called him back in after Ralph shot Ollie. Hayes calls Ralph to his office and says that at least one of them came out a hero. He then tells Ralph that he's not running for reelection after Terry's death, and he needs to move on. Hayes then tells Ralph that the DNA in the saliva on Frankie's body is a match to Terry's. Ralph wonders what different it makes, and Hayes points out that when Gloria sues them for negligence, it might keep her reward down. The detective wonders if Glory deserves every penny, and Hayes insists that they both thought they were prosecuting the right guy. As Ralph starts to go, Hayes talks about how strange things have happened throughout history. The DA admits that there are unanswered questions, and they have to learn to live with it and move on. Ralph says that it's hard for him and leaves.

That night, Ralph shows Jeannie the flyer and asks her what comes first thing to her head. He figures someone saw it, tore it off but left a corner, and got into the van. Jeannie uses Google to find the restaurant the logo belongs to, between New York and Ohio, and finds a Big Daddy's Hangry-Q in Dayton.

Glory finds Jessa sitting on her bed, and the girl says that she dreamed about the man again. There's a puddle of goo on Jessa's floor, and Glory goes to get Jessa some water.

Ralph and Jeannie visit Tamika in the hospital after she delivers her baby. Jack is sitting in the room, and Tamika's husband and mother are there. Tamika says that Yunis updated her on the case. Ralph finds Yunis looking at Fred, who survived his hanging but is in a coma after his brain lost oxygen for ten minutes. The agent says that the Peterson family is gone, and Ralph leaves with Yunis and says that he needs to know if the boy dumped the fan near the Hangry-Q. Yunis advises him to take some time for himself, and Ralph admits that he hasn't seen his therapist yet. He figures that if the boy dropped the van is Dayton when the Maitlands were there, they want to know if the killer crossed paths with the family. Yunis confirms that the boy is in foster care, and agrees to get Ralph with him if Ralph sees the therapist.

Later, Ralph meets with the therapist and refuses to discuss Derek. The detective says that he's sorrowful and angry, and isn't getting much sleep. The therapist asks him about his dreams, and Ralph says that he's having weird ones. He describes his dreams of what happened when Terry was killed, and claims that no details stuck with him. The therapist tells Ralph that it's good Ralph came in so soon, but warns that the injuries to Ralph's psyche could take weeks to manifest. Ralph suggests that he's fine even though he doesn't feel fine, and being there feels like a punishment. The therapist tells Ralph that he can walk out and he won't stop him, and Ralph tells him that when anyone says that they're there to help, things get worse for him.

Later, Yunis takes Ralph to the boy, Merlin, at the foster home. Ralph asks him if remembers the Hangry-Q in Dayton and when Merlin left the van off. Merlin says he never saw the restaurant before, but he remembers the parking lot. The boy remembers that it was ""three cars ago"", and Ralph tries to narrow it down to a date. Merlin finally remembers a woman with a smudge of ash on her head. Other people had it, and Ralph figures that it was Ash Wednesday. As they leave, Ralph confirms the date was March 6 and the Maitlands were in Dayton during that day even though they flew both ways.

Back home, Ralph approaches Glory at her house and says that he needs to talk to her. She refuses at first, and he suggests that if Terry didn't do it, someone deliberately framed him and it might happen again. Glory asks Ralph how she's supposed to explain to her daughters while she no longer has friends, and the thing will go with them no matter where they move. Ralph says that the only way Glory is going to get her life back is to clear Terry's name, and they need to find the real killer.

After a moment, Glory closes the door in Ralph's face. She sees Maya on the upstairs steps and sits down next to her, and holds her tight.

The next morning, Howie finds Ralph working on his lawn. The lawyer knows from Glory that Ralph visited her. Howie warns that talking to Glory won't stop him from filing a lawsuit, and Ralph tells him that he doesn't care about the lawsuit. The lawyers set up a meeting between Ralph and Glory at Glory's house with Alec looking on, and Ralph says the van used in Frankie's murder was dumped in Dayton when the Maitlands were there.

Glory figures Ralph is still trying to pin the murder on Terry and tells him to get out, but Ralph believes that Terry never saw the van as he claimed. He says that it's all strange and the van seemed to follow the Maitlands home. Ralph asks why the Maitlands went to Dayton, and Glory explains that Terry's father is at a senior center in Dayton, has dementia, and tends to be violent. She and the girls stayed in the hotel or went to a movie the entire time Terry was at the senior center. When Ralph asks about the Hangry-Q, Glory tells Howie that she wants the interview over. Ralph asks if anything out of the ordinary happened, and Glory insists that nothing happened.

Maya is listening from the stairs and says that Terry got a cut. When Ralph goes out to join them, Maya asks him if he's the man who killed her father. Ralph says that he didn't but he made some terrible mistakes, then asks Maya to tell him about the cut. She says that he saw it visiting his father, and she remembers it because Terry said he got it from a nurse but the nurse was a man. Terry said that he bumped into the nurse when he slipped on a wet floor, and when he got up he saw he had a cut on his wrist. Maya then reminds Glory that there was a ""pig restaurant"" near their hotel, even though they never went there. Glory doesn't remember, and she says that the cut was nothing and goes upstairs with Maya.

A teenager, Ethan Elman, drives his truck out to a barn that his family owns. He finds a pile of abandoned clothing on a hay bale, and sees that it's covered in goo. There's a horse-head belt buckle in the pants, and police sirens sound in the distance. Ethan looks nervously around, wondering if the clothing's owner is still there."

The GBI agent and his men bag the discarded goo-covered clothing.

At the cemetery, Ralph cleans up Derek's gravestone and wishes he could tell his dead son about the last week. Two gravediggers laugh as they walk by, and Ralph walks over to the Peterson graves they were digging. The detective looks at the family's four graves.

At the station, the officers welcome back Tamika, who is on crutches after her leg was broken by Ollie's shot. Jack is surprised to see her there, and Tamika says that she's there to pick up some things. Her superior says that he's going out to the barn because the State police found clothes that they think belong to Terry. Jack figures everything will be wrapped up by the time he gets there.

Ralph is going over his files when Jeannie comes in. Her husband says that he found out which senior center Terry's father was at, and that the father was arrested for aggravated assault in 1985. Jeannie reminds Ralph that he's on leave because of post-shooting protocol and suggests he take the time off. Ralph asks how her day was, and they both chuckle.

At the Peach Crease, Jack is drunkenly telling a stripper to dance to humpback whale music. He insults the dancer and she storms off. Claude asks Jack if he's working, and Jack says that he's taking his time getting there. When Jack tries to provoke Claude, Claude doesn't rise to the bait. Jack tosses money on the stage and leaves.

A bus arrives at the prison and the guards take a new inmate, to his cell. The man glances briefly at another prisoner as he goes past his cell.

Jack arrives at the barn that night and finds the place closed up. He urinates and then goes in, using his flashlight to see. Someone moves in the darkness, and Jack jumps and calls out that he's a police officer. Something stings Jack in the back of his neck and he curses.

Ralph watches news footage of Terry arriving at the courthouse, and remembers hooting ollie.

Jack finds a medical cabinet and bandages his neck. When he touches the reddish skin, he moans in pain.

The next day, Yunis meets Ralph at a diner and shots him photos of the clothing. The horsehead buckle is the same one they saw on Terry in the surveillance tape, and Terry's fingerprints were on it. Some of the fingerprints were solid, while the weaker prints were like an 80 or 90 year old. Yunis confirms that they all belonged to the same person, but the forensic account couldn't account for the discrepancy. The fingerprints matched the ones in the van,, but there was one set that the techs thought was too degraded to check.

Ralph wonders what's going on, and Yunis says that they first thought the substance on the clothing was semen. However, the liquid was in other parts of the barn, and nobody has been able to identify it. Ralph thinks they should let Howie and Alec know what's going and see if they have any ideas.

In prison, the newcomer watches the prisoner. The prisoner takes a lens out of his eyeglasses.

The school principal, Theresa Ogletree, calls Glory in and the other children and their parents have a growing hostility toward Jessa and Maya. Theresa says that she's going to have to release Glory's daughters. She offers to help Glory with home schooling, and says that it's outrageous when children have to pay for the sins of their parents. Glory insists that Terry was innocent and leaves.

Ralph and Yunis meet with Howie and Alec, and Ralph insists that they're just trying to get to the bottom of what happens. Ralph says that he's trying to get justice for Terry and Frankie, and isn't going to apologize for fucking up. Howie insists someone else had to drive the van, and Ralph wants to find the real killer because no one else will go through it and nothing less will do. Alec figures someone has to retrace Terry's steps to Dayton, and Howie suggests they send Holly Gibney. Ralph has heard of Holly and figures that she's... unique.

Holly is in her apartment identifying cars as they drive by, going by their engine sounds. Alec calls and asks her to retrace Terry' movements in Dayton. Holly wants to meet with Ralph in person but refuses to fly there because she's afraid of flying. She goes to the bar below her apartment and complains that one man is sitting in her seat. He irritably moves and Holly sits down, continuing her conversation with Alec on the phone. Alec agrees that she doesn't have to fly, and Holly hangs up and orders a drink.

The next day, Ralph meets with his therapist, Herb, and figures that Herb is outwaiting him so he'll go past his rehearsed answers. Ralph says that he's been gardening since their last meeting, and things are good with Jeannie. He talks about how things were rough when they lost Derek. Herb offers his condolences, and Ralph tells him that they're good. The therapist asks how things were for Ralph when they got rough, and Ralph remembers drinking and getting involved in bar fights. He then tells Herb that they should just focus on the courthouse shooting.

Jessa sits outside her house and stares off into the night.

Later, Alec takes Ralph to meet with Holly at a bar and they watch a baseball game on the TV. Holly pieces together the date and stats of a game Alec saw as a child going just by the date, Ralph gives her all of the information on Terry's vacation, and says that she needs to find out who was working in the center wing the days that Terry visited. Holly quotes Ralph her fee, assuring him that he'll get back anything she doesn't spend, and asks for half up front. Alec agrees and Holly offers a toast in Lithuanian.

In prison, the prisoner gets a letter with a drawing of a bloody child's face. The guard says that it must have slipped through the screening. Once he leaves, the child-killer sharpens the glass lens on the edge of his bunk.

Holly suggests that Terry had a doppelganger, a mythical creature that is a non-biological double of someone. She says that they're looking for a flesh-and-blood biped, and Ralph notes that she said ""if"" it's a myth. He admits that he has no tolerance for the unexplainable, and Holly says she's a savant. Her parents had her tested and studied by psychiatrists when her behavior first manifested. None of them could account for it, and Ralph is shocked her parents let them study her. Holly says that they were scared and though the psychiatrists could ""cure"" her of being herself. She says that she's good and goes upstairs to her apartment, and thanks Ralph for drinking to make her feel comfortable as she goes. She goes up to the stairs, gasping for breath. A man comes out and looks at her, and Holly calms down and continues to her apartment.

The newcomer pulls a razor from where it's buried in beneath the skin of his leg.

The child-killer lies on his bunk and looks thoughtfully at the sharpened lens.

Grace wakes up to find Jessa sitting by her bed. She says that her mother has to call Ralph because she has something to tell him. When Glory asks what it is, Jessa says that ""the man"" told her to only tell Ralph, and refuses to answer Glory's questions.

Later, Ralph takes Jeanie to the Maitland house. Howie is there with Glory, and Glory explains that Jessa thinks she has to tell Ralph something about her dream. She tells Ralph that he should ease Jessa's mind, and Ralph agrees. They go in and Jessa insists that it wasn't a dream. Glory and Maya point out that a man couldn't have gotten upstairs, and Glory interrupts when Ralph ask why Jessa though it was a dream. Jessa says that the man said he wouldn't come back if she gave Ralph the message, and tells him that the man said that Ralph should stop. If Ralph didn't stop, something bad would happen. When Ralph asks for details, Glory takes Jessa to her room and curses Ralph for not helping.

Jeannie talks to Glory privately, and Howie asks how Ralph found Holly. The lawyer admits that Holly is a loony but good at what she does.

Glory and Jeannie talk in the kitchen, and Jeannie says that Derek used to have nightmares and telling him he had bad dreams just agitated him. They took Derek's nightmares seriously and eventually he either got over his dreams or got bored with them questioning him. Jeanie advises Glory to let Ralph keep asking Jessa about her dream. Glory refuses, but says that Jeannie can talk to Jessa.

Jeannie talks to Jessa, who says that she's seen the man four times. The first time h looked like Terry, and she didn't mention it to Glory. Jessa explains that the man was mean and tried to make her cry. The second time his face was blurry like someone tried to erase it. The man said more mean stuff, and the last time the man wasn't blurry and was muscular with tattoos. Jessa says that she's tired and doesn't want to talk about it. Ralph is listening and tells Jessa to tell the man to give him the message. Jessa says that Ralph doesn't want the man to do it, and the man wants Ralph to be scared rather than her.

Holly goes to the hotel room where Glory and her daughter stayed, and recreates what happened in her mind. She then goes to the parking lot of the Hangry-Q where Merlin abandoned the van, notices a surveillance camera, and studies it. The head of mall security, Andy Katcavage, pulls up and says that he's shorthanded so he's working. Holly tells him that she's looking for the footage from six weeks ago, and Andy says that they erase them once a week. She explains that she's trying to find the man who took the van, and explains that he murdered a child. Holly says that she's a PI, and Andy exchanges business cards with her. He tells her to contact him if she needs help and she leaves.

Jack is at the Peach Crease, drinking, and the back of his neck is swollen. He falls off his stool, drunk, and when one man tries to help him up Jack screams in pain. Jack says that he'll do anything to make the pain stop, and it does.

Jeannie goes to the Maitland home and asks Glory how she and Jessa are doing. Glory confirms that Jessa slept through the night, and Jeannie assures her she just wanted to check on the family. Glory says that Maya saw a horror movie about leprechauns and Terry told her that leprechauns aren't allowed to leave Ireland. Maya accepted that, and Glory breaks into tears at the thought of Terry. She asks Jeannie how she lives with Derek's death, and Jeannie says that it's impossible.

Holly goes to the senior center and the receptionist, Angela, refuses to let her talk with Peter Maitland. She says that Peter wouldn't recognize Holly and he's been going downhill in the last month or so ago. Holly asks if something happened then, and Angela figures that Holly is a reporter like the ones who showed up a month ago when the police were there and orders her out. The receptionist isn't aware that Terry is dead, and calls a security guard. Holly leaves on her own and calls Ralph, and explains what happened. The police wanted to talk to Peter as part of the investigation, and she's going to look into it. Holly apologizes for calling prematurely but says that sometimes she likes to hear the voice of someone on her side.

That night at her apartment, Holly checks the newspaper from a month ago and finds an article about two young missing sisters. The killer is described as a ""monster"".

After lights out, a guard unlocks the newcomer's cell door. The newcomer goes to the child-killer's cell, and the killer hears him coming, takes out the lens, and puts his back to the wall. The newcomer comes in and the killer tells him he doesn't need to do it. The newcomer comes at him, the killer cuts his throat with the sharpened lens and collapses. Startled, the newcomer leaves.

Jack sits in his apartment, saying that he'll do whatever the creature needs him to do."

Holly calls Ralph and says that there were two similar murders of twin sisters, and the suspect killed himself in prison. Heath worked at the senior center where Terry's father Peter stayed, and the man was one of Heath's charges. Holly warns that she probably won't get back into the building after what happened the day before, and Ralph goes down his living room and looks at the articles Holly emailed him.

Outside the senior center, Holly waits for Angela to leave. Once she does, Holly follows her home. When Angela gets out of her car and walks to her apartment, Holly follows her and Angela sprays pepper spray in her face. Holly admits that she followed Angela from worker, and insists that she's a PI rather than a reporter. She directs Angela to her ID, and once she checks it Angela takes Holly inside and gives her a wet cloth.

Holly notes that the papers said Heath claimed he was on vacation the time of the murders, and Angela says that he told her he was going to his mother's place. She confirms that he came back to check on his charges from time to time, and doesn't figure Heath killed the girls. Holly says that there have been lots of cases of killers whose close ones never suspected them, and Angela says that when she did see ""Heath"" back at the senior center, he didn't say anything even though he's usually chatty. The PI writes down the date Angela saw ""Heath"", and Angela tells her that one of the janitors said he saw ""Heath"" come out of Peter's suite. The janitor saw ""Heath"" bump into Terry and scraped Terry's hand, drawing blood.

Angela notes that there were other witnesses who said that they saw Heath with his mother at the time of the murders, Heath's mother Ernestine said Heath never left her side the whole week. The police were interested in Peter after the girls' murders, and Angela tells Holly that she'd have to talk to them about why they were interested in Peter.

Jack goes hunting and kills a deer.

Glory interviews a home-school tutor, Florida, for her daughters. She that the envelopes with all of Florida's references are from different states but all postmarked Atlanta, she writes down an equation and asks Florida to solve it. Florida can't, and Glory figures that she's a tabloid reporter undercover. Florida says that she's trying to write a sympathetic article, and Glory orders her out. She throws Florida's purse out on the sidewalk and a recorder falls out of it. Florida picks up her things and drives off.

Jack loads the dead deer into the forest from his truck and winces at the painful spot on the back of his neck. He then gets into his truck and drives off.

Glory goes to a restaurant to eat with Howard, and people look at her and mutter Terry's name. One man tells Glory that she has a lot of brass showing her face in public, saying that might someone might want to even the score against her daughters. Howard tells the man to stop and the two of them start fighting. The owner tosses the man out, and Glory sits in silence.

Holly calls Ralph and tells her what she found out from Angela, and Ralph knows about ""Heath"" scratching Terry from what the Maitlands said afterward. Holly notes the discrepancy of ""Heath"" being there the day after the girls were found day. Ralph calls Yunis and says that he needs to take a look at the footage of Terry from the day of the murder. Yunis warns that it's a tricky request, and Ralph says that he figures something on one of the tapes is a game changer.

Holly pays a nurse to get her in the back entrance of the senior center.

Ralph goes over the tapes from the strip club with Yunis.

Holly goes to Peter's suite and discovers that Alzheimer's has scrambled his memories. He rambles on and Holly asks him if Heath said anything. Peter then says that it wasn't Heath, and figures that ""he"" fooled all of them.

Ralph goes over the tape and finally locates a shot of ""Terry"" scratching Claude's hand.

Jack goes to a hardware store and buys lamps of all sizes along with gas containers.

Holly meets with Andy and notes that Heath killed the two girls when Andy was still working homicide. She figures there's a connection between Heath and Terry, and Andy admits that he can talk to some people... if Holly goes out to dinner with him. Holly agrees to dinner, and Andy tells her that he has the strength of ten because his heart is pure. Amused at his joke, Holly chuckles.

Jack drives the lamps and gas containers out to the forest and places them near the dead and rotting deer.

Holly and Andy go to a restaurant for dinner and they talk about how Holly was raised in Pennsylvania. She says that she went to Chicago to start over because her mother died, and her mother was taking care of her. Holly brings up the subject of Peter, and Andy tells her that the police investigated every suite that Heath might have entered. A day later they got a DNA match on one of the girls. The police thought it might belong to Heath's younger brother Aaron, but the DNA didn't match and Aaron OD'd later. They found plenty of DNA evidence and one girl's bloody clothing, all connecting Heath to the murders.

Claude doesn't remember anything new from that night, and Ralph leaves.

Andy walks Holly back to her apartment, and she admits she has no idea how tall she is even though she can calculate anyone else's height. He invites her to have a nightcap at the bar beneath, and Holly says that she can't because she has to work. She impulsively kisses Andy and walks inside, goes to the bar, and looks over her notes. She tells the bartender what happened and the bartender wonders who gave the ""murder virus"" to Heath.

Holly gets a coffee to go, visits Angela, and asks if Heath took any trips out-of-state in the last year. Angela remembers that Heath went to New York City but doesn't remember where he went. She tells Holly that Heath sent her a postcard and shows it to Holly. Holly takes photos of it and gives it back to Angela, then back at her apartment does a Google search of crimes in NYC just before Heath visited. She finds a report of a midtown bartender, Maria Ceneles, arrested because of a child slaying. On the postcard Heath says that he met a girl.

The next morning, Holly calls Ralph and says that she has to go to NYC to investigate a child killer who crossed paths with Heath at the hotel he was staying at where she worked. Maria is alive on Riker's Island, awaiting trial, and the lawyer has always gotten permission for Holly to meet with Maria. Ralph agrees to talk to Howard who is covering expenses.

At the station, Tamika hands out invitations to her newborn's christening. Jack is staring at a blank arrest report. Tamika hobbles into Jack's office and asks if he's mad at her because he didn't look her way when she was talking about the christening. She points out that Jack hasn't done anything, and Jack promises that he'll be at the party.

Holly takes a taxi to Riker's and remembers being MRI'd as a child, and her mother being there to comfort her and putting a small fetish doll in her hand. The taxi arrives and Holly stays in the back, remembering, as long as she can. She then takes the bus to Rikers.

Maria finally remembers that she went out for breakfast with a guy who looked like Heath, but she's not into guys and blew him off the next morning.

-----

After breakfast, Heath and Maria have sex.

-----

Holly explains that Heath was arrested for torturing and murdering two girls in Ohio a month ago, and says that he was innocent like Maria was.

-----

Maria says that they wouldn't let her go to her father's funeral and insists that she was innocent, and Holly tells Maria that she knows. Maria realizes who framed her, but says that no one can help her because what the killer does can never be undone. Later, Holly discovers that one of the women in the reception area overheard her and left Holly a piece of paper with an address.

In Howard's office, Merlin meets with Ralph and says that he left the van in the parking lot. He didn't tell Ralph about the man who took it because Merlin was scared of the man.

-----

The man in the hoodie stares at Merlin from across the lot and says nothing.

-----

Ralph asks Merlin to try and draw the man he saw, and Merlin starts sketching.

Holly goes to the address and meets with the visitor, Idilys Castro, who says that she overheard what Maria told Holly. She asks if Holly believes in one devil or many, and explains that in Cuba she was told that El Coco would come for her and ate her if she misbehaved. Her grandmother was told the same when she was a child, and the legend of El Coco goes back many generations. A Russian woman once told Idilys that El Coco was Baba Yaga, the boogeyman, Idilys warns that El Coco can look like a person if it wants. She says that the creature is known as the Grief Eater because it stays behind and feeds on the pain and anguish of the families of victim and framed killer.

Merlin finishes his sketch and shows it to Ralph. The man's face is crude and unfinished.

Back in her hotel room, Holly sits in her bathtub, drinks, and looks up El Coco on the Internet. There are pictures of the inhuman monster in cultures and legends across history, always feeding on children. After a moment, Holly lays back and submerges her head beneath the water."

Three Days Earlier

Tracy sits in his home, with ""Child Killer"" scrawled on the walls outside, and smokes. He then sweeps up the dust, takes out his military uniform, and lays it on a bed.

In the woods, Jack pulls the dead deer over to the pile of lamps and gas containers that he's made. He argues with his unseen controller, insisting that one of the lamps is perfectly good, and asks why it doesn't like it. There's no answer, and Jack angrily asks what's happening to him. He says that he's ready to die, and collapses to the ground in agony.

At the clinic where she works, Jeannie calls Anjanue in to her office. She notices a man in a hoodie sitting in the waiting room as she goes inside.

Ralph tells Yunis, Howard, and Alex what Holly found out in NYC. She's learned that Maria's story is pretty much the same as Heath's, and admits Holly hasn't found out anything except there are other child-killers in the U.S. Holly is heading back to Dayton, and Ralph suggests that she's coming back because she's waiting for everything to gel. He suggests that they have faith in Holly's investigation and see where she takes them next.

Jeannie talks to Anjanue and assures her that she's doing everything she should be doing to stay clean and then the judge will downgrade her sentence. Anjanue says that she didn't go to her parenting workshop because her baby got sick, and the instructor didn't respond to Anjanue's texts. As Jeannie escorts Anjanue out and calls in her next client, she sees that the man in the hoodie is still in the waiting room.

Jack watches Howard's office building.

Ralph, Howard, and the others come out and Howard says that they haven't found out anything about the goo in the barn.

Jeannie tells everyone that they can't wear hoodies over their heads. The one man doesn't remove his hoodie or move, and Jeannie goes over to him. She prods him in the shoulder, and his head falls back since he's asleep.

At home, Ralph reviews an article on Maria's arrest and the boy Luis that she killed. Jeannie comes in and she talks about how her day was weird. She talks about the man in the hoodie at the clinic and suggests that they get takeout because she doesn't want to cook. Distracted, Ralph agrees, and Jeannie goes to lie down for a bit. When the food arrives, Ralph goes to the bedroom to wake Jeannie up. She doesn't wake up and Ralph sits down in a chair next to the bed.

-----

In the past, Ralph sits in the bedroom drinking. Jeannie refuses to get out of bed, still mourning their dead son Derek. When he says to pull herself together, Jeannie kicks Ralph away and points out that he's at home when he should be at work. Ralph says that Derek son is gone, and Jeannie says that Derek was gone and he was hers and Ralph wasn't there. She tells Ralph to go.

-----

At the bar beneath her apartment, Holly sits and drinks. She talks to Skye about the boogeyman in Skye's childhood, and Skye says that it was Baboulas. Holly says the words ""Grief Eater"" and asks Skye what's the first thing that comes to mind when she hears them, and Skye finally says ""Tear Drinker"". When Holly considers places a Tear Drinker would go, she finally comes up with the idea of a cemetery. Skye wonders if they're just goofing around discussing a Tear Drinker, and Holly offers her $200 to drive her around.

At the Peach Crease, Claude sits at the bar and remembers the night ""Terry"" came in. He looks briefly at the hand that ""Terry"" scratched.

Jeannie goes to the kitchen to the water and hears someone moving in the house. She assumes that it's Ralph, but no one responds to her calls. A figure in a hoodie steps out and Jeannie drops her water glass in shock. The figure commands Jeannie to sit and she does so, and then says to tell Ralph to stop or she and Ralph will both die.

The next morning, Ralph wakes up in his bed and gets up. He finds the broken water glass on the dining room floor and drops of the Outsider's silvery blood. Jeanie is lying on her bed, asleep, and Ralph discovers her feet are cut from the broken glass. Jeannie jerks awake, crying, and Ralph goes to get something for her feet. She doesn't remember what happened, and tells Ralph he should drop the investigation. Jeannie feels that if he doesn't, something bad will happen, and Ralph tells her that something bad has already happened and he's trying to get to the bottom of it.

Holly drives to Hofstadter house and takes a photo of the outside wall with ""Child-Killer"" scrawled on it. She finds the place boarded up and goes inside, taking photos of everything and finds Tracy's closet.

Outside, Jeannie tells Ralph that someone was in the house and spoke to her, telling her to tell Ralph to stop investigating or they'll die. Ralph figures that she had a dream, and insists that no one will die. He figures that Jeannie overheard Jessie say the same thing, and Frankie's death has stirred up their memories of Derek. Jeannie doesn't believe it, and Ralph reminds her that she used to sleepwalk when the doctors put her on anti-depressants. She still sleepwalks, and Ralph figures that she's looking for Derek. Ralph swears to her that she had a vivid nightmare.

Holly has Skye drive her to the cemetery nearest the Hofstadter house and she finds a grave to the two dead sisters. Their mother's grave is nearby, and Holly figures that the Outsider take the entire family eventually. Holly takes photos of the nearby houses, and Skye comes over. The PI says that ""he"" was there, and all he had to do was close his eyes and inhale the grief. Holly goes back to the car and Skye follows her.

Jeannie sits at the kitchen table and draws the figure's face as best she can recall.

Holly has Skye drive her to the cemetery where the Hofstadters are buried, and sees a nearby abandoned factory. She takes photos of it and sends all of her photos to Ralph. Holly then calls him and asks him to take some photos around where Terry is buried. All she will say as explanation is that it might be important, but Ralph demands something to give the others. Holly tells him to humor her and hangs up, then notices a man kneeling next to Heath's grave. She takes a photo of him and goes over, offering her condolences.

The PI claims that someone asked her to come there and offer his respects, and asks what Heath's relationship was to the man. The man--Tracy--says that ""he"" fucked over Heath good and fucked him over as well. Tracy walks off, ignoring Holly's questions.

Jeannie has Ralph drop her off at an Urgent-Care, and Ralph says that he'll be there for her outside if she needs him. He then explains that Holly wants him to go to the cemetery to take photos of where Terry is buried, and doesn't know why. Ralph admits that he's going to do it, and Jeannie tells him to tell Glory. When her husband hesitates, Jeannie says that she'll call Glory later, gives him the sketch she made of the figure, and goes inside. Ralph looks at the facial features of the deformed figure as Jeannie drew him, then calls Yunis and asks him to check Claude's fingerprints against everything they have on Terry's homicide. He also asks Yunis to send him a mugshot of Claude and drives off.

Later, Yunis meets with Ralph. As they drive out to the cemetery, Yunis says that Claude's fingerprints didn't match anything at the scene. He asks Ralph what it was all about, and Ralph shows him Jeannie's drawing. He insists that Jeannie had a bad dream, and Yunis talks about how his great-grandmother had a dream of how she had a dream about one of her sons dying in the war before she got the official news. Yunis insists that dreams are messages.

The men arrive at the cemetery and find Glory and Jeannie already there. Glory complains that the temporary stone isn't there yet for Terry, and Ralph asks her if she minds if he takes some photos. She agrees and Ralph takes photos of the area. Yunis points out the barn where they found the clothes.

At Tamika's christening party for her baby, Jack arrives. Ralph and Jeannie are there, and Ralph goes over to Jack, who is drinking ginger ale and says that he's taking a break. When Ralph asks Jack if he saw anything at the barn that the state police might have missed, Jack angrily tells Ralph that he's not on the job. Tamika comes in with her baby, Jerome, and Jack declines to hold the baby, claiming he's coming down with something. He walks out and Tamika gives Jerome to Ralph to hold, then goes after Jack. Tamika confronts Jack and asks what's going on with him, and complains about his attitude the last few days. Jack says that he's going through a patch, and he wouldn't hold Jerome because he doesn't want anything to happen to him. He refuses to explain further, and tells Tamika to back off for her own sake.

That night, Holly calls Ralph and tells him that he's looking for hiding places for something. She says that Terry and Heath never went near the children they were accused of murdering. Holly also isn't surprised that the barn was close to Terry's grave. She finally tells Ralph that it's better if she explains in person, and Ralph tells her that she has to tell everyone involved by coming to Cherokee City.

That night in her apartment bed room, Holly is in the bed and watching a horror movie. Andy calls from the bar downstairs and invites her to join him. Holly invites him up to her room where there's a mini-bar, and when he comes up, she tells him how she snuck into Heath's house. She notes that the mattress was gone but someone came in and put clean sheets on the box springs. Holly explains that two daughters hired her to investigate their mother's strangulation death, after all of her things were stolen. She figures the killer was someone who knew the victim and displayed gestures of remorse, and the bed-maker was involved in the twin sisters' murders.

Andy pulls Holly over, and Holly says that she has a big meeting and she's nervous. He offers to go, and Holly suggests that they lay down for a little bit.

As Tamika lies in her bed, she hears someone moving in the house. She gets up, draws her gun, and goes to investigate. She finds the figure standing over Jerome's crib, and watches as the intruder picks up the baby. The baby cries and the figure walks off... and Tamika wakes up from her dream. She discovers that Jerome isn't in his crib, and runs outside to find her husband Roger sitting on the porch swing, holding their son.

Holly gently kisses a sleeping Andy and then leaves for Cherokee City.

Jack goes to Ralph's house and apologizes for snapping at him the day before. He says that he's been having personal problems, including drinking, Jack offers to take up some of the slack with everyone's workload and show Ralph what an asset he can be. Ralph points out that the Maitland cases are closed, and Jack asks for an opportunity to help. After a moment, Ralph asks Jack about the barn.

Andy wakes up and sees a note that Holly left behind for him.

Tracy sits in his running car and takes a revolver out of the glove compartment. He gets out of his car, approaches a nearby truck that he's been watching, grabs the driver, and shoves him to the ground, gun held at his head. As Tracy realizes that he3 has the wrong target, the driver asks what he wants.

Holly is driving and comes to a traffic jam caused by the police ahead. A train is crossing the tracks, preventing her from going further.

As Andy dresses and prepares to leave, he finds Holly's list of timetables of the murders. He takes it with him.

The police have surrounded Tracy and tell him to put the gun down. The driver warns Tracy that if he shoots him, the police will shoot him. After a moment, Tracy drops to his knees and tries to fire at the SWAT officer, and they open fire on him.

Once the train passes, Holly's engine breaks down.

Andy gets on a computer and checks the names on Holly's timetable against the Internet news reports of the people.

Holly calls a tow truck for her car.

The police confirm that Tracy's revolver was unloaded, and they figure that he set the whole thing up to get himself killed. There's a blistered red mass on the back of Tracy's neck.

Ralph sits in Derek's old room, then lies down and tries to sleep. He dreams of Derek coming in and telling him to look at him. Ralph does and Derek tells him that he needs to let him go."

Holly is in the station watching, and calls Andy. She says that she saw Tracey at Heath's gravesite two days ago and wants Andy to look into it, and Andy immediately agrees. He then says that he's been thinking about Holly all day, and Holly thanks him and hangs up and gets on her bus. Once seated, Holly looks at the photos she took of the back of Tracey's head and sees the blistering.

As the bus goes down the highway, Andy texts Holly that Keith and Tracey were first cousins. The WiFi signal disconnects, and Holly turns off her laptop and sits back to sleep.

Ralph looks at Merlin's and Jeannie's sketches of the figure.

Holly sleeps on the bus.

Jeannie comes out at 6 am and finds Ralph still up. He goes to make her some coffee, and Jeannie asks him about Merlin's sketch. Ralph explains where the sketch came from, but isn't convinced the figure is real.

Holly wakes up and goes to the bathroom. Tracey is there, his face shot up, and he grabs Holly and turns her toward the front of the bus, telling her to look. Holly sees a semi across the highway, and Holly yells at the driver to stop. When she moves up front, she sees that there's no semi there. The driver pulls to the side, scraping the guide rail, and brakes the bus to a halt. Holly looks back and sees no sign of ""Tracey"", and tells the driver that she must have had a nightmare. The driver continues along.

Jack wakes up and feels at the blisters on his neck, and discovers that they're gone.

At the kitchen table, Jeannie insists that she saw the same person as Merlin. Ralph doesn't believe it, or that Jessa saw the figure as well. He points out that they're both alive despite the threat the figure made to Jeannie, and Jeannie suggests that Ralph is making a worse mistake keeping the investigation going. Ralph asks if she would feel the same way if Derek died, and Jeannie says that he's hitting below the belt but admits that he's right. Her husband says that he believes Jeannie dreamed the entire thing and there is no figure.

As Ralph washes the dishes, Jeannie says that she wants to go to the meeting with Holly and bringing Tamika, Jack, and Glory as well. She insists that Glory needs to see that Ralph is making some progress, and offers to invite Glory personally. Ralph agrees and answers his phone when Jack calls. Jack asks if there's anything he can help out with the meeting, and Ralph invites him along.

Later, Jeannie is sorting things in Derek's room and asks Ralph if he wants to help. He declines and leaves, and Jeannie takes the toys to the Maitland house for Jessa and Maya. She says that Glory should only go to the meting if she wants and assures her that she'll be there, and then asks Jessa if the figure still had Terry's eyes when he visited the second time. She says that the figure had holes for eyes, As Jeannie goes, Glory tells her that what she's putting Maya and Jessa through better be worth it.

Ralph meets with Herbert, who points out that Ralph missed their last session. The therapist warns that if he thinks Ralph is incapable, he'll have to note it to the review board. Ralph finally says that he saw Derek in what he says was a dream. Herbert asks why he thinks he had the dream now, and Ralph suggests that Derek was telling Ralph not to confuse him with Ollie since they would have been the same age.

On the bus, Holly gets a call from Andy. He says that they found the Williams' sisters fingerprints in Tracey's car. Tracey dated the older sister, and Andy suggests that Tracey was an accomplice in their deaths.

Ralph returns home and sees the sketches of the figure taped to the wall, including the new ones that Jeannie made from Jessa's description.

Jack meets Holly when her bus arrives in Cherokee City, and introduces himself. He explains that Ralph asked him to pick Holly up. They go to a diner and Jack says that he's new to the investigation. Jack asks for a preview of what she'll be talking about. Holly doesn't want to, saying that she's still organizing her thoughts. The detective wonders why Holly keeps staring at him, and she says that he looks like he's going through hell. She wonders if his wife left her, and Jack says that she left a few months ago but he was glad to see her gone. As they go, Holly mutters that no one will believe her.

After using the bathroom, Jack wets his face and looks at himself in the mirror. He turns and sees the words ""Stop her"" written on the wall behind him. As Jack drives Holly to the meeting, he asks Holly why no one will believe her, but she refuses to talk about it.

At the meeting at Howie's office, Alec points out all the evidence pointing to Terry as the killer. Jeannie notes that Terry was in another city. Jack and Holly arrive, and when Holly comes in she goes over everything that she's found about the other two murders. She notes all of the contradictory information and the fact that each killer had an apparently-accidental encounter with the previous one a month earlier.

Holly suggests that the three supposed killers were victims, and were all selected She suggests that El Cuco is a real entity that kills and eats children. Yunis is familiar with the legend from his childhood and crosses himself. Howie tells Glory that he doesn't have to listen to Holly's garbage, but Glory wants to hear the rest and Jack sides with Holly. Holly says that whatever the presence is, it's evil and it's real. She says that the key to stopping the next murder is to discover who El Cuco plans to duplicate next.

Glory curses at Holly, furious that she's been investigating the boogeyman to clear Terry. She walks out and Howie goes after her. Ralph and Yunis leave next, and Yunis figures that Claude is El Coco's next target. Ralph doesn't believe a word of it and walks off.

In the conference room, Holly tells Jeannie that everyone in the related families has died. She figures that Tracy was involved in the Williams' sister murder, and he was somehow driven to help El Cuco when it had taken on Heath's appearance. Jack looks at Holly's evidence and listens, and winces at the renewed pain in his neck. ""Stop her"" appears on his hands, but only he can see the words.

Alec meets with Howie and says that he doesn't believe Holly, but he isn't ready to say he doesn't. He's read up on myths and legends, and suggests that the legends of El Cuco has a basis in fact. Howie isn't impressed, and tells a joke about a Yiddish vampire, then walks off.

Jeannie gets into the car with Ralph, and when Ralph complains about Holly ""clown show"", Jeannie tells him to cut it out. Holly is sitting in the back, and Jeannie explains that she invited Holly to stay with them. Ralph sarcastically agrees.

Jack drives home.

When the Andersons return home, Jeannie takes Holly to the guest room. Holly looks at the figure sketches taped to the wall and complains that Jeannie didn't bring them to her, and Jeannie admits that she should have. Jeannie explains where she got them, and Holly says that they signify transformation. She figures that El Cuco waits 24 to 27 days between killings because it transforms between each murder.

Jeannie shows Holly where the figure was sitting when it warned her, and Ralph says that he didn't dust for fingerprints because there was no sign that anyone was sitting there. Holly asks Jeannie to get her Scotch tape and colored markers, and Ralph sarcastically comments on El Cuco. He says that he's known people like Holly who live in their own reality, and Holly says that she knows what she sounded like and doesn't enjoy being humiliated. She insists that she delivered what she believes is the truth, and apologizes for what the meeting became. Holly tells Ralph that she's such a disappointment to him, and asks him to let her see the investigation through.

When Jeannie returns with the tape and markers, Holly creates a purple light from her phone and checks the chair where the figure was sitting. Traces of the figure's liquids are on the chair and table, and Ralph says that they have to have the residue tested to confirm if it's the same they found in the barn. He says that the original residue samples are still being tested, and Holly says that the technicians are stumped because what they're examining isn't human, animal, mineral, or vegetable. She suggests that they'll eventually dismiss the residue contents as contamination, and figures that El Cuco is shedding.

Jack enters his home and stands hesitantly in the darkness.

At home, Glory looks through a drawer with Terry's things and buries her face in his clothing.

After Jack takes a shower, he comes out to find his dead mother waiting for him.

Glory takes out a drawer

Jack says that his mother is dead and she should go away. El Cuco, appearing as Jack's mother, tells Jack that he fucked up like he always does. She leaps across the room and tackles Jeff, then punches him repeatedly.

Glory tosses Terry's clothes and things on the hallway floor into a pile.

Sobbing, Jack crawls away and begs his mother to stop.

Jeannie wonders if El Cuco was there or not, and Holly finally speculates that the creature projected its consciousness because it was too weak to move. El Cuco can't risk physical exposure, so it uses ""servants"" like Tracey. Ralph goes into Derek's room and wonders if he saw El Cuco earlier instead of his son. Glory calls and asks Ralph to come over.

Ralph and Glory meet in the Maitland kitchen, and Ralph apologizes for not vetting what Holly was going to say. He insists that they're going to continue to find the real killer, and Glory figures that Terry was so good that they shouldn't have to work so hard to prove his innocence. She asks Ralph if he thinks Terry killed Frankie, and Ralph says that he doesn't believe it. He insists that whenever he investigates a crime, there's a rational explanation.

At the strip bar, Claude hears two men arguing. He goes over to break up the fight and one of the men slashes him with a knife. Claude goes berserk on the man, and the other bouncer pulls him away, warns him that he's still on parole, and tells him to get some. When Claude goes out the back, he pauses as he senses something, but then dismisses it as his imagination. As he gets in his car and drives away, Yunis watches him down the street from his car.

Ralph returns home and finds Holly in the kitchen making tea. He tells her that it's not his decision to fire her from the case, and complains that she gave a name and resume to the unexplained. Holly warns Ralph that El Cuco is trying to stop them, terrifying the people around Ralph, and says that El Cuco wouldn't be trying to stop them if their investigation didn't threaten it and it wasn't vulnerable. She says that Ralph is the one El Cuco would go after the most, and asks what El Cuco said to Ralph. Ralph insists that ""Derek"" wasn't El Cuco, and finally tells Holly that ""Derek"" said to let him go. He admits that he didn't tell Jeannie, and Holly goes to bed as Ralph mutters that ""Derek"" wasn't El Cuco.

Glory finds Jessa going through Terry's things.

Ralph and Jeannie lie in their bed, and they hold each other.

Holly prints out the photo of Tracey's neck with the blistering.

The next morning, Jack wakes up choking on his blood sprayed on the walls. The blisters on his neck are back, and Jack says ""okay"".

Holly is getting dressed and putting makeup on his bruises when Jack calls him. He says that he hated the way she was treated in the meeting and offers to provide her with something tangible to prove her theory. Jack tells Holly that he found something at the barn that everyone overlooked, and she needs to come see it for herself. Holly goes to her car, and Jack tells her not to mention her excursion to the Andersons and hangs up. Jack then loads his pistol and goes out. Holly is there, having found his address on the Internet, and says that she doesn't trust anyone's driving but her own. Jack gets into the car with Holly and when she notices his bruises and cuts, says that she should see the other guy.

Holly drives to the barn, and says that he would look better without the makeup covering his bruises. She grabs a pack of wipes and takes one out, and when she ""accidentally"" drops it, Jack bends over to pick it up. Holly sees the blisters on his neck then looks away when Jack sits back up. She says that she needs to go back to Ralph's to get some stuff she printed out that Jack should see, but Jack stops her and says that it will keep."

Andy is packing his things and leaves.

Ralph stands in his kitchen and stares contemplatively at the kitchen table while drinking his coffee. He takes down the sketches of the Outsider that Jeannie taped to the wall, and Jeannie comes out and sees him put them in a drawer. He asks where the chair is that the Outsider sat in, and Jeannie says that she doesn't want it there and it's out back until the next garbage pickup. She says that she's already ordered a replacement. Ralph notes that he heard Holly leave earlier and Jeannie wonders what business she would have in town that early. She wishes Ralph has talked to Holly, and he says that he was in bed. Jeannie leaves for work, leaving Ralph alone.

Howie is working in his office when the phone rings. He finally takes the call from Glory, who says that she's going back to work that day. She doesn't want to sue, and Howie tells her that they'll proceed when she's ready. Jessa asks Glory stay with them, and Maya wonders if people are going to be mean to her. Glory tells her daughters that there are nice people in Cherokee City and she's going to sell a house to one of them.

Ralph picks up the photo of the back of Tracy's neck that Holly printed out, then drops it and walks out.

Holly continues driving with Jack in the seat next to her. He winces in pain and Holly asks how far it is to the barn. Jack turns on the radio and doesn't answer her question, and Holly repeats her question. He talks about how he didn't believe in anything when he was kid, including the boogeyman, but now he believes that there's something worse out there than anything he ever imagined. Holly tells him that he's right to believe, and Jack wonders what the Outsider is. She admits that she doesn't know anything about the Outsider, and Jack shows her the blisters and says that he's just like Tracy. He wonders if he'll eventually let himself be killed, and Holly says she's going to track and expose it if she can. Holly says that once she sees what Jack wants to show her at the barn, she'll find it and stop it. She asks Jack if he knows she's trying to help him, and Jack moans in pain and doesn't answer her question. Jack then tells her to take the next road and turns up the volume on the radio.

Ralph tries to call Holly but she doesn't answer. He leaves a message for her to call him, then calls Jack and gets his voice mail. Ralph leaves a message for Jack to call him, asking if he knows where Holly is. He then calls Ralph and asks him to have Holly call him. He calls Alec, who says that Holly seemed to be hanging around Jack and figures that they're together since neither of them are answering their phones. Ralph tells Alec to meet him at the apartment where Jack is staying.

Claude gets fired at the strip club, and his former boss Lenny gives him severance pay. The ex-bouncer says that he hasn't been feeling like himself lately and goes to his car.

Holly continues driving, and Jack wonders why the Outsider picked him. She suggests that the Outsider is drawn to pain, and Jack has been wronged all his life. Jack describes how his mother wronged him.

Glory shows a couple a house, and they stare at her. She finally says that she's Terry's wife, and all they're thinking about is which of their friends they'll blab to first. Glory snaps at them and then takes them to see the guest room.

Ralph and Alec knock at Jack's door but get no answer. They pick the lock and go inside, and find the blood on the walls and the place torn up. Ralph calls to put a BOLO out on Holly's car, and says that they should consider Jack armed and dangerous. Once he hangs up, Ralph and Alec break into Jack's truck in the parking lot and search it. Alec calls Howie and says that Holly is missing and they think she's with Jack. Howie says that he can't help them at the moment, and figures that Holly and Jack went off somewhere together because Jack apparently believed her claim. Alec says that there's blood on the walls and hangs up.

Jack's phone rings, and he ignores it. Holly asks him what the Outsider forced him to do for it, and Jack says that it has had him do spying, mostly. She wonders why Jack didn't stop him from telling everyone what she knew instead of just taking her there, and points out how the Outsider is making Jack pay. Jack tells her to keep her eyes on the road, and wishes that Holly had told him more about his tormentor than she really can.

Ralph goes to Tamika's house and asks how she's doing. She joins him on the lawn, and Ralph tells her that they think Jack has taken Holly. Ralph wonders if Tamika has noticed anything odd about Jack, and she says that she hasn't seen since the christening. Meanwhile, the Outsider enters Tamika's house and looks down on the crib where Tamika's baby son Jerome is sleeping. Meanwhile, Tamika says that she's transferring to computer crimes after she comes back from maternity leave, and tells Ralph that she hopes he finds Jack before going inside.

Alec and Ralph go to the strip club and ask Lenny if Jack was there. Lenny says that he wasn't, and says that Claude quit. Alec asks Lenny to give them a ring if he talks to Jack and hands the owner his card, and meanwhile Yunis calls Ralph and says that he pinged Holly's phone and it's with Jack's. Both phones are heading down the highway, and Ralph and Alec drive to intercept them.

Jack seemingly dozes off, but Holly wakes him up to say she has to go the bathroom and can't hold it. She pulls over at a gas station, then fishes for something in her handbag. Jack asks what she's taking with her, and Holly says that she's having her period. He takes her phone, claiming the battery on his is about dead. Holly goes into the restroom and closes the door behind her, gasping. She can't get the window open. An impatient Jack finally comes over.

Holly grabs the lid off the toilet and breaks the window. Jack runs around to the back, and Holly runs out the front and gets back into her car. When Jack comes back, he holds up the car keys he took. She has a spare set and drive away, and Jack draws his gun and shoots at her. Cursing in frustration, Jack throws the cell phone down and stomps it. Holly pulls over down the road and discovers that her cell phone is gone.

Alec asks Ralph if any of it makes sense to him since he knows Jack. The investigator wonders why Ralph thinks Jack would abduct Holly, and Ralph says that nothing has made sense in his life since Frankie was killed. Alec talks about how, one summer when he was a kid, he got lost in the woods. It got dark and cold, and two hunters who were part of a search party found him. Before they found Alec, he heard something call his name twice. Ralph immediately dismisses it as imagination, but Alec insists that wasn't what happened, and he's never been so scared since. The police officer has nothing to say to that.

Glory meets with her employer Lorraine at her house, and Lorraine warns that the couple might file charges for emotional distress. She figures she should never have let Glory come back to work, and Glory figures there'd never be a right time. Glory says that she needs to make a living, and suggests Lorraine sell her house and move with her daughters to get a fresh start. Before she goes, Lorraine tells Glory that she shouldn't let them run her out of town after what they've put her through. Glory calls Howie and tells him that they should sue the police and any other city government department, and maybe the individuals.

Ralph and Alec reach the gas station, and question the clerk who saw nothing. Alec sees where a car pulled out, and the two men find the smashed phone. Ralph admits that he doesn't know if Holly is dead. Police cars pull up and Ralph figures that once they show them the cell phone, they can go because Yunis already briefed the police.

In the forest, Jack sits alone and considers shooting himself. He puts the gun in his mouth and tries to pull the trigger, but can't. Jack yells in rage and drops to his knees, then rolls over on his back. He shoots his gun into the sky, cursing.

Howie arrives at Ralph's house, and finds Ralph, Alec, and Jeannie there with Holly. Holly tells them that she originally believed Jack, but then sound the blisters and figured Jack was delivering her to the Outsider. She figures the Outsider only feeds on children, and came to the conclusion Jack was taking her somewhere to eliminate her and he had no choice in the matter, but he was fighting against the compulsion. Holly figures the Outsider gets into his ""Renfields"" through the blister wound, and the only way they can get free is through death. She figures Jack Is wherever the Outsider wants him to be.

Jack walks to the highway and tries to get passing cars to stop for him. A truck driver finally stops and gives Jack a lift.

Yunis shows Holly a photo of Claude and asks if she's ever seen him, and Holly says she hasn't but hesitates. He tells Holly to hold onto the photo, and Andy arrives at the f4ront door and asks to see Holly. When Holly comes to the door, Andy hugs her in relief.

The truck heads to Cherokee City.

Yunis tells Ralph that they have an APB out on Jack and the cops are staking out his apartment. The GBI agent notes that the gas station was in the opposite direction from the barn, and Jack's phone is turned off. Ralph wonders why Jack didn't kill Holly in the first place, and Yunis says that Holly told Ralph the truth about Jack not wanting to kill her but Ralph won't believe it. Yunis says that Holly said she didn't recognize Claude but she couldn't work out where she had seen him. The GBI agent says he just wants the whole thing to end, not make sense like Ralph does, and leaves.

The driver drops Jack off at a roadside restaurant.

Andy talks to Ralph and says that he's been doing his own research on Heath, which led him to Terry. He wants to be part of the investigation. Holly calls Ralph in and points out that the Outsider in its final transformation stages, and that Ralph knew the Outsider scratched Claude. She wonders why Ralph didn't tell her, and Jeannie tells her husband that he doesn't get to play like it's reasonable and rationale to ignore everything irrational happening in his face. Jeannie tells Ralph that he needs to get over that or step to the side because he's standing in everyone else's way.

Jack sits on the grass across from the restaurant as night falls.

Ralph calls Herbert and makes an appointment in an hour. He then looks at the kitchen chair that he recovered from the garbage, then sits on it. Later, Ralph meets with Herbert and asks him if he believes in God, or Heaven and Hell, or evil. The therapist finally says that he believes in medical research, and Ralph figures that Herbert believes negative things have a rational explanation. Herbert asks Ralph to tell him what's going on with him, and Ralph explains that something is unfolding that is too much for him. The therapist asks for specifics, and Ralph finally tells him that he has to let go to let something in. He apologizes because he can't say anything more, and Herbert says that he can't do anything for him. However, the therapist says that there's a lot they don't know about the world and never will.

The next morning, Holly wakes up from a nightmare of Jack shooting her at the gas station. She goes to the bathroom mirror, looks at herself, and screams in defiance."

The car guarding Jack's motel room leaves in response, and Jack goes into his room and gets some guns out of a hidden compartment. He loads them up and takes them to his truck, gets a radio out of his glove compartment, sets it to the police frequency, and drives off.

Claude goes to Cecil, Tennessee, and meets with his brother Seale. They hug and go to get beers.

At the Anderson place, Holly wonders where Claude is. Andy says that he already checked with Claude's parole officer and learned that he said he was going to go hang with Seale in Cecil. Howie says that there's not much there then bars and a cave, and Holly says that she's going to go to Cecil and isolate the Outsider if he there's taking on Claude's form. She figures that when the Outsider strikes, all of the forensics will show that Claude was responsible.

Holly explains that the Outsider had to run once the footage turned up of Terry being 60 miles away when Frankie was murdered. She figures that it has to stay in one place for weeks at a time after it kills, to regain strength and go through the transformation, but this time it was too weak to fend for itself and had to run. Jeannie figures that if Holly can provide Claude with an alibi, then the police will look at other suspects and the Outsider will run again, weaker than before. Eventually Holly figures that the Outsider will reveal itself to the world.

Ralph asks her how they'll know what it becomes after it becomes Claude. Holly figures the Outsider isn't strong enough to kill yet because it's still transforming. Andy tells Holly that he wants to go with her, and Yunis wants to go as well. Ralph finally says that he'll go, and a surprised Holly agrees.

In Cecil, Claude and Seale drink and talk about how big the coming cave festival will be. Seale mentions how Claude left the Peach Crease, and Claude explains that he felt he had to get out of Cherokee City before something really bad happened. He tells his brother that he can't sleep and keeps triple-checking the locks on his doors. Claude thinks there's someone in the apartment with him or trying to get in, and it feels like something is going to go down.

As they leave, Yunis suggests to Holly that he call ahead and have Claude held by the authorities before they arrive. Holly agrees, then tells Andy that she's going to ride with Ralph. Ralph goes back in his house with Howie, who says that he worries about Ralph sometimes. The lawyer says that Glory has given him the go-ahead to sue everybody in town involved with Terry's arrest except Ralph. Howie says that Glory figures that Ralph can vindicate Terry, tells Ralph to be careful wherever he's going, and leaves.

As Ralph packs, Jeannie comes in and wonders where she's going. Ralph says that he doesn't have another lead, and his wife tells him not to go because he doesn't believe in the Outsider so he won't see it for what it really is. Jeannie warns that there will be a battle and she can't survive losing Ralph as well.

Jack drives down the highway and hears a radio APB for him. They identify his truck by make and plates, and Jack curses in frustration.

As Ralph drives, he tells Holly that Jack broke into his own place and stole his truck. He talks about how Jack once told him that all he wanted to do as a kid was become a sharpshooter in the military. Jack enlisted at 18, then went to sniper school and got his dream. He failed the last round of psych evaluations before deploying, and ended up as a warehouse clerk. Holly figures that's why the Outsider wanted Jack, and Ralph asks what the Outsider wants. Holly says that it just wants to survive and it's not human, and an irritated Ralph tells her that he knew she was going to say that.

In a rundown neighborhood, Seale brings Claude to the old family house where Seale still lives.

Yunis drives and asks Andy if he's a believer in El Cuco. Andy says that he believes in Holly and goes where she goes, and they discuss Andy's relationship with Holly. He hopes that he and Holly are a ""thing"", and Yunis says that Hollys is a very unique person. Yunis says that Holly can walk into a room full of people and pick out which ones are going to die soon, and asks if Holly has acted toward Andy like she can sense the same thing about him. Andy looks nervous, and Yunis snickers and admits that he was joking.

Holly asks Ralph why he's coming, and doesn't accept his answers that he's looking for answers. He says that he's desperate but won't tell anyone because they're afraid of being laughed out of the squad. Holly says that she knows he's still fighting the theory, but she feels more grounded around him than anyone else. Ralph half-jokingly challenges that, and Holly says that she needs disbelief more than belief.

Claude asks Seals if he's still going to the anger management class, and Seale says that he finds the class helpful. His brother looks at a photo of their family and they both admit that people in their family have a temper. One of Seale's fellow workers pulls up, and Seale goes to talk to him while Claude goes to get some takeout. Two policemen pull him over and one of them says that there's been a complaint, addresses Claude by name, and tells him to step out of the car and come with them.

The officers take Claude to the jail and lock him up, without telling him why they arrested him. They finally give him his phone call.

Holly tells Ralph that she didn't know about his son. Ralph talks about how his mother died when he was in the basement when he was 16, and after he played a song on a record she wanted (Washington Square by The Village Stompers), he called his father to tell him what happened. He heard the song on the radio for the first time in 15 years later on the night Derek was born. Ralph asks what Holly makes of that, and Holly says that it was a coincidence. Surprised, Ralph says that he thought she'd have more and chuckles. Holly joins in and Ralph says that his mother would have loved the story.

Claude tells the officers who arrested him about some of the strippers at the Peach Crease. Seale come in response to Claude's call, furious, and the officers tell him to calm down or they'll arrest him as well. When Seale prepares to fight, one of the officers tasers him and both officers handcuff him.

A man returns from fishing and finds Jack's truck parked next to his. Jack shoots and kills the fisherman, then sits in the forest and listens to chewing sounds, disgusted. Once the Outsider is finished with the fisherman's body, Jack takes the man's truck and drives off.

Claude and Seale sit in a cell together, and Seale calls the officers ""pansy-assed little bitches"" because one of them tased him from behind.

The Davidson family drives to the Cecil caves.

Jack pulls over on the highway and tries to avoid looking at the fisherman's photo of his family on the rearview mirror. The Outsider in the back tells him to pass the photo back, and Jack reluctantly does so. El Cuco's hand has Claude's tattoos on the knuckles. The creature says that it needs to eat, saying the fisherman was full of cancer, and Jack drives off.

When Ralph and the others arrive in Cecil, they wonder what to tell Claude. Holly says that they should tell him the truth, go in, and Yunis says that they're there to pick up Claude. Yunis confirms with one of the officers, Council, that his superior had them detain Claude and calls the man. Once Council gets the okay, he releases Claude. Claude refuses to go without Seale, and Yunis agrees to get Seale released as well.

Howie asks Alec why he didn't go with the others, and Alec finally says that when he was Iraq, he felt something bad was going to happen. He tells Howie that he hasn't felt that way since he did foot patrols in Iraq, and that he isn't going on any more foot patrols.

In the caves, Jack listens as the Outsider feeds. It roars at Jack, who clutches at the blisters on his neck in pain.

The Davidsons arrive at ""Cavestock"", and the father Mike winces at the price.

Ralph and Yunis take Claude and Seale out, and Holly and Andy are waiting. Holly says that they need to talk privately, and they go to the Bolton home and tells Claude about the Outsider. Claude admits that he feels like something has been getting into his head, and Ralph walks out. Yunis says that they had Claude picked up for his own protection, because the police could alibi him if there were any murders. Claude insists on staying in his family house and Holly says that they'll stay there with him. Seale figures that he can vouch for Claude on his own, and Yunis points out that he doesn't have the best reputation.

Holly goes out to Ralph and tells him to go home. If he can't believe in the Outsider, they're a danger to everyone else. Ralph tells her to let him come in at his own pace, and she asks him to come in faster.

That night, the Davidsons walk around Cavestock and the boy, Sam, looks around, thrilled. His sister, Wanda, notices a cute boy at a food stand and says that she's hungry. Sam goes off to look at something, while his parents get beers.

Ralph notices gunshot holes in the inside walls of the house, while identifies Seale's jigsaw puzzle even though he put away the box lid.

Alec visits Howie and says that he should have gone with the others. He figures he should have watched Holly's back, and Howie points out that Holly is with three police officers. Alec admits that Howie is right but he can't help feeling like they abandoned Holly.

The group goes out on the porch and Claude asks them how long they intend to stay. Holly figures the Outsider will strike soon and frame Claude. Seale tells them that they'll have to find somewhere else to stay, and his brother tells him that everyplace is booked up for Cavestock. The group agrees to stay, and Yunis goes to check out something he saw when they drove in and will be back soon.

Sam is looking at a display, while Mike tells his wife Deb that he's finally bored with Cavestock. Deb says that Sam isn't bored, and Mike points out that Sam is a nerd. Meanwhile, a foxhead-masked Outsider comes up to Sam and offers to take him to a cave with prehistoric claw marks on the ceiling. Sam eagerly goes with him to see the claw marks.

Mike sees Wanda with two boys and goes over to ""disperse"" them. One of the boys sees Sam with the masked Outsider and admires the latter's mask. Wanda goes over and yells that the Outsider has his brother as the Outsider takes Sam into the crowd. When two locals come over to confront the Outsider, he shoves Sam at them and tries to run, but they tackle him. Mike pulls off the foxhead mask and gets a look at Claude's face, and the Outsider runs off.

Ralph calls Jeannie and tells her that not much is happening there. A car pulls up, slows down, then drives off. Seale comes over and Ralph realizes the driver was Seale's weed dealer. He asks Seale to hold off on buying while they're there. Holly and Andy come out and ask to borrow Ralph's car so they can get some things. They drive to a convenience store, and Holly sees something nearby and tells Andy that she'll be back in a minute. She goes into a strip-mall church, crosses herself, and sits down next to Yunis. Holly says that she's tired and Yunis takes her hand.

At the station, detectives question the Davidson family about what happened.

Yunis drives back to the Bolton house with Holly, and sleeps in the car. Meanwhile, Holly sits on the porch couch with Andy and he covers both of them over with a blanket, holding Holly.

Ralph wakes up in the middle of the night when hears something moving. He goes to investigate, drawing his gun, and finds Claude looking out a window and yanking opening doors, looking for someone. Claude finds no one, and Ralph watches him from the shadows and then goes back to bed.

Later, Ralph wakes up on the sofa where he's sleeping when Seale flashes a camera bulb in his face. Seale says that he wanted to document the occasion of police sleeping in the house.

The next morning, Howie and Alec knock on the car window, waking Yunis up. They go in the house, waking up Andy and Holly on the porch. The police detectives arrive and say that they're there for Claude. Ralph and Yunis tell Seale to go inside and let them handle it. Once he does, Ralph flashes his badge and suggests that they talk outside. Once the detectives say what happened, Ralph says that he can personally vouch that Claude was there with him. Holly joins them as the detectives show them a tablet with video of Mike unmasking the Outsider--revealing Claude's face--at Cavestock. Holly tells Ralph that ""he"" is here, then corrects herself and says ""it""."

At a barn, one boy climbs up into the hayloft with a flashlight. He hears someone moving in the darkness, and the boy he's playing flashlight tag with ""tags"" him. The boys, John and George Weaver, run outside and across a field into the forest.

At home, the boys' father Emmitt calls them to dinner. They don't respond, and Emmitt goes into the barn to look for them but doesn't find them. Emmitt searches the forest for them but doesn't find anyone.

Now

Inside the Bolton house, Howie looks out and watches Ralph and Yu8nis talk to the Cecil detectives. The lawyer goes out, and Ralph shows him the video of ""Claude"" at Cavestock. Ralph assures the detectives that Claude was with him the night before, and says that they were there because Claude is a witness in a homicide and Ralph came down to get a statement. Yunis explains that they wanted to question Claude is a non-threatening environment, and Seale let them stay. He says that the perp they're looking for abducted an 11-year-old boy in Cherokee City, and Ralph asks to interview their witnesses to see if they're dealing with the same guy. The detectives consider the idea, say that they'll be in touch, and leave.

Once they leave, Holly warns that whatever they say in front of Claude, El Coco can see and hear what he sees through their mental link. Seale isn't convinced but Holly tells him that the safer Claude is, the safer they all are. Howie hangs back with Ralph and asks him if the video was of El Coco. Ralph advises Howie to believe it while he's there and goes inside.

The group meets in the kitchen, and Andy wonders what they do once they find El Coco. He wonders if they can kill it, and Ralph figures that if it needs food to sustain itself, it can be killed. Holly suggests that they just contain it, but still isn't convinced El Coco exists. The others admit that they don't know anything about stopping it, and Holly says that one of them take Claude somewhere while the rest of them make plans. She tells Seale to drop the attitude because they need him. When Claude comes in, Seale suggests that they go to a diner to get chicken. Howie offers to drive Claude, and Claude agrees to go with him.

Ralph calls Jeannie and tells her that they're working on ""it"". He says that they're making progress, then says that El Coco is there. As Jeannie backs out of the driveway, she almost hits a jogger. Jeannie pulls back into the driveway, and tells Ralph that he can't go near El Coco. She asks Ralph to come home, begging him not to go after it, and Ralph says that they're just going to share what they know and step away.

-----

John and George go to the nearby Bear Cave. They don't have money to go in through the front gate and John takes his brother to another entrance blocked by a rock fall that the local children know about.

-----

The group watch the video and figures El Coco panicked. They figure it's starving and took the rest, and will go after another kid. Yunis points out that El Coco knocked over Mike Davidson even though he's starving. Andy confirms there's only one cemetery within ten miles, and suggests that he and Holly check it out. Seale says that they don't have any family buried there, and that all of the coffins at the one the Boltons favored got flooded in the 60s. Holly and Andy go to the kitchen, and Seale tells Ralph that Claude is all that he's got.

-----

Emmitt comes to the main entrance and talks to the woman running the souvenir shop, Evelyn Stickhouse. She says that no one has come through, and when he says that he needs to go in, Evelyn tells him to go ahe3ad without paying. Emmitt grabs a flashlight and goes in.

-----

Yunis hears from the detectives that Sam and Mike are coming in to look at mug shots, and they'll let Ralph and Yunis sit in. Howie and Claude leave to get chicken.

Hayes' secretary tells him that a hiker called in and said that he came across the body of a young boy who was killed the same way Frankie was. They wanted Hayes to check it out, but he refuses while telling his secretary to have the police in Cecil keep him posted.

Claude figures that El Coco sees and knows everything he does, and asks Howie to pull over because he's going to be sick. Howie does so and Claude gets up and throws up. When Claude gets back in, he tells Howie about he figures there's nothing he can do about any virus, including El Coco.

-----

John and George continue into the caves. Meanwhile, Emmitt continues searching for his sons.

-----

Andy and Holly arrive at the overgrown cemetery, and they find the stones of a couple who died at around the same time. Holly deduces that they both died of Spanish Flu in 1918, but Andy believes that they were conjoined at the soul and one decided to follow the other. When Holly smiles, Andy notices but she says that she's not smiling about anything in particular and leaves, with Andy following her.

Ralph and Yunis participate in Sam's questioning, and how Foxhead mentioned the Bear Cave. The boy describes how his grandpa wrestled with Foxhead, Ralph assures Sam that he's doing great, and asks if Foxhead touched Sam. Sam says that Foxhead had his hand on his shoulder, and Ralph confirms that Foxhead didn't scratch Sam. He claims that Foxhead wouldn't have hurt Sam to reassure the boy.

Andy and Holly go to Cavestock and get a map of the area. He wonders why El Coco ran off the direction that he did, and Holly finds the mounted map of the caves that Foxhead and Sam were looking at. She finds traces of the same residue found on the clothing.

Ralph questions Mike, who asks why Ralph asked Sam if Foxhead scratched him. The detective says that it's just a question they're required to ask, and Ralph says that the umasked Foxhead had ""weird eyes"" that were too far back in the sockets and he still looked like he was wearing a mask.

In the caves, El Coco looks at Jack sitting by himself.

Once Mike and Sam are escorted out, Ralph and Yunis ask one of the detectives about the Bear Cave. He hasn't heard of it, and they leave.

Hayes goes over photos of Frankie's body at the crime scene,

After Howie and Claude get chicken, Howie says that they should wait to go back and suggests they try some of the chicken now. Claude figures that Howie doesn't remember him from court eight years ago, representing him on a charge of assault and battery in a bar fight. Howie was sentence to mandatory AA, and Howie tells him that he's had to stand up for evil bastards and Claude should take it as a compliment that Howie doesn't remember him.

-----

John and George continue through the caves, and they come to a dead-end and retrace their steps.

Emmitt continues searching. He hears his sons yelling and yells back to them, but they can't find each other because of the echoes. Emmitt finds the Bear Cave and yells at his sons to stop moving while he goes for help. He leaves, snaps at Evelyn, and calls in locals to help him search for his sons.

-----

When they go back to the Bolton house, Andy points out the path El Coco fled on the map. When Ralph mentions the Bear Caves, Seale says that it was sealed in 1947 because the Weaver boys got themselves lost. Four Boltons died in the search.

-----

Emmitt, his wife Dara, and half of the search party open up the rock fall, and Emmitt assures Dara that they'll get their boys out. The party enters the caves and follow their voices. The yelling sets off a new rock fall, trapping them.

-----

Seale says that the party was trapped in the caves when there was a rock fall, and they slowly starved to death. Other search parties couldn't blast the rocks free without bringing down the entire cave, and 34 people in the first party died. Seale says that his people are ""buried"" in the cave, and it's the biggest cemetery in the state. He describes the souvenir store, and how locals broke down the concrete plug the state authorities sealed the caves off with so they could go in and get high. Ralph asks Seale to show him where it is on the map, and Seale gets a bigger map of the area. Holly figures that El Coco is in the caves, and Seale comes back and shows them the caves and a back entrance but an earthquake caused a rock fall and blocked it off.

Seale says that maybe El Coco is waiting for them. Ralph claims that they're just trying to find El Coco and call in the ""cavalry"", and they'll tell them that Foxhead is in there. Seale wonders what happens if El Coco gets past the party, and if it will come for Claude since he doesn't know anything since they're keeping him in the dark. Howie and Claude come back with the chicken.

Glory visits Jeannine.

As the group prepares to go into the cave without Howie, the lawyer complains that he didn't come there to babysit. Howie warns that he has to leave the next day, and Ralph assures him that they'll back in a few hours.

Glory says that she ran into Hayes at the county building and he wanted to talk to her. She refused because he's a plaintiff in one of her lawsuits, but he was acting hangdog. Glory explains that she was mad at Jeannine for dragging her to the meeting, and Jeannine admits that she and a lot of the others believe what Holly said about El Coco. She tells Glory that she can't explain what the others are doing but they're risking their lives. Glory says that she didn't want the meeting to destroy the good will between them, and she wants Jeannine to know that she respects the sincerity of Jeannine's beliefs.

The group takes two cars to the caves, and Yunis tells Ralph that he's stopped talking about El Coco as conditional, and Ralph agrees but admits that it makes him sick to his stomach. Alec is in the back, and tells Ralph that he has to take small bites to accept that El Coco is real. When Ralph objects, Alec tells him to accept what he can until he's ready for another bite. Yunis wonders what they do if El Coco doesn't want to be contained, and Alec says that then they kill it before it kills them.

Howie smokes weed with Seale and coughs, and Seale asks if it's right them not telling Claude their plans. He insists that it's not right, and Howie tells him to stick with the plan. Howie goes to the kitchen to get some leftover chicken, and Claude wakes up. As Howie opens the refrigerator, he hears Seale telling Claude about El Coco. He goes back as Claude tells his brother that El Coco is in his head, and Seale just told him that the others are coming for it.

El Coco sits up and walks away.

Howie calls the others but doesn't get a signal. Seale admits that he might have fucked up, and Claude tells him that the others are going up against El Coco for him. The three men get into Howie's car and drive to the caves.

Jack loads the guns that he brought with him, takes a drink of whiskey, and goes to a hill. He sets up a sniper post and waits, unaware of the rattler nearby.

As Andy and Holly drive to the caves, they play movie trivia and Holly knows all of the movie info. She admits that she never saw the movies. They pull over and kiss, then drive on to join the others. Jack sees the cars pull up and prepares to shoot.

As Andy prepares his gun, Holly warns that firing it in the caves is a bad idea because the sound could cause a gunshot. Jack pulls the trigger, blowing Alec's head open, and the others take cover as Jack fires six more shots."

Yunis and Ben draw their guns and return fire, but are unable to hit their attacker. Ben yells to Jack saying they can talk, but Jack ignores him and keeps shooting as he drinks from the bottle of whiskey he brought.

Howie, Claude, and Seale drive up, and the other wave waves at them to keep going. The lawyer pulls over and the three men get out and take cover. Seale returns fire with his rifle, hitting Jack's bottle, and a rattlesnake approaches Jack. When Jack tries to knock it away with a long stick, the others get to closer cover. Jack returns to shooting and kills Seale when he steps out, then laughs in triumph. Yunis fires back at Jack and runs, and Jack shoots him in the arm. Ben helps Yunis to cover, and Howie gets back in his SUV but Jack shoots at him through the window.

Claude runs to his brother's corpse and tries to drag him away, and Howie goes to help him. Jack is distracted reloading, and Claude and Howie get the body to cover. Andy's phone won't get reception, and Holly realizes that he's considering making a break for one of the cars and tells him not to think about it. Yunis says that they have to advance or die, and Andy runs for the truck. He gets in and stays low, and starts the truck. Andy backs the truck up then stops as he passes out, and Jack shoots the gas tank, causing a leak onto the road. Holly realizes what will happen next and tries to run over, but Howie stops her and says that he'll get Andy.

Jack shoots the gas puddle, causing a spark that ignites the gas tank. As Howie runs over to get Andy out, the truck explodes, killing both men. Jack draws a bead on Holly, who walks out, stares at Andy's burning body, and then screams at Jack in defiance. Breaking free of El Cuco's control, Jack hesitates. El Cuco tries to take control of him again, and Jack clutches at the throbbing blisters on his neck. Jack mutters ""no more"" and turns to see the rattlesnake. He thrust his leg out at it and tells it to come at him, and it bites him.

The group below hear Jack's screams of pain, and then a gunshot. Holly walks over to Ben and tells him that it's time as more gunshots ring out from Jack's position. She says that it's time and walks away.

El Cuco realizes that Jack is dead and sits down, growling.

Ben gets some flashlights, confirms that Yunis will be okay by himself, and goes into the caves with Holly. Jack limps up, his body swollen with the venom, and Ralph aims his gun at him. Yunis aims his gun as well and tells Jack to put down his rifle, and Jack says that El Cuco is in the caves and they should kill it. He then kills himself with his own rifle and Holly and Ralph continue into the caves through the back entrance. They find the gate unlocked and walk into the darkness. They find El Cuco's handprints on a railing and Holly figures he's scared of dying so he can be killed. There are half-eaten animal carcasses scattered throughout the caves, and Holly figures that he's feeding.

Holly and Ralph wade through an underground lake and hear something splashing behind them. They find traces of El Cuco's spoor on the walls in the shape of his handprints, dozens of them, and Holly realizes that he was in a frenzy. Ralph finds the stone that marks where the search party died beyond, and Holly figures that El Cuco went crazy trying to get at the bodies.

Yunis kneels next to one of the corpses and clutches his head in grief.

Ralph and Holly reach a larger cave, and El Cuco tells them to watch their step because it's slippery. They go in and find El Cuco's lair. El Cuco, wearing the shape of Claude, is waiting for them. Ralph draws his gun, and El Cuco asks Holly what made it so easy for her to believe in him and how she convinced Ralph and the others. Holly asks what El Cuco is and what its name is, and he says that he doesn't remember. She wonders if there's more like it, and El Cuco wonders if there's more of its kind because there are times when he can sense there could be more.

When Ralph aims his gun at El Cuco, he points out that the noise would most likely bring down the walls and kill all of them. El Cuco yells and parts of the ceiling crumble. The creature says that the dead are there and advances on Ralph, and says that he still that the bodies give off a glow, particularly the Boltons. El Cuco says that their emotional fills them, and says that it eats to survive. Holly asks why he feeds on children, and El Cuco tells her that they taste the sweetest.

Ralph moves in on El Cuco, and Holly tells him to stop, warning that El Cuco is poison. El Cuco tells them that he can't let them leave, and Holly says that they can't let him leave. Ralph says that Yunis is still alive and knows what El Cuco is, and El Cuco walks toward Ralph and says that he needs to eat. Claude steps out of the shadows, shotgun ready, and Ralph tells him to put it down. Holly warns him not to shoot, but Claude stares at his doppelganger,

After a moment, Claude shoots El Cuco. The sound echoes throughout the chamber and the ceiling starts to come down. Ralph gets Holly out, while Claude stares at El Cuco's body. When the collapse ends, Claude calls Ralph and Holly over. A slab of rock has pinned his leg, and Holly and Ralph lift it off. They hear something moving in the darkness and go to check it out while Claude stays behind.

El Cuco is impaled by a stalagmite, impaling him to the ground. Holly borrows a knife from Ralph and uses it to stab El Cuco in the heart. Ralph tells her to leave El Cuco's body there because no one believe he killed Frankie. They go back to Claude and assure him that he killed El Cuco, and then they help Claude out. Ralph sees two children, Frankie and Derek, but Holly and Claude don't.

Ralph tells Holly and Claude to go on, then goes back to El Cuco and retrieves his knife. He says that El Cuco is playing possum. Ralph admits that he's not sure if El Cuco can be killed, and figures El Cuco is getting weaker and can't run or hunt. When El Cuco moves his hand, Ralph pins the hand to the ground with the knife. He talks about how tourists and then scientists will come, and the scientists will take El Cuco to their labs and cut off pieces of him as samples. Ralph picks up a large and rock and says that it would serve their purposes if no one knew El Cuco existed. El Cuco takes on the appearance of all the people that it's duplicated, and Holly returns to see Ralph beat in El Cuco's head. He sees Holly, and she turns and leaves.

Ralph and Holly take Claude back to the cars, and Claude stares at Seale's body. Ralph and Yunis drag Jack's body away, and Holly looks at Andy's body and then continues walking When Ralph finds her, Holly says that Andy only came there to be with her. Ralph says that they need to get their stories straight before the authorities arrive, and once the others leave, Ralph looks at the bodies and kneels in the dirt.

In his office Hayes is looking at the footage from the strip club. Yunis calls and tells Hayes that there was a shootout, and Alec, Howie, and Jack are dead. He tells Jack that was compelled to kill by someone else, and the killer is still out there. Yunis claims that the killer is still on the loose, and sends Hayes a link to the video. He advises Hayes that some of the decisions coming out of his office need to be revisited.

Ralph tells the local detectives that Seale got a call from someone who claimed to have knowledge of a more like suspect in Frankie's killing.

Yunis has Claude review his testimony that Ralph and Yunis came to question him because he identified Terry at the club. Claude claims that he made a mistake and the killer was someone who looked like Terry.

Hayes goes over the transcripts from the witnesses who identified Terry, and looks at the video of El Cuco from Cavestock.

Ralph says that the trail lead to the cave's souvenir shop and Jack. He says that he thought the phone call was to set up an ambush.

Claude wonders how long they'll keep Seale's body. Holly tells him hopefully not long, and Yunis continues going over the story they came up with.

Holly tells a police interrogator how she met Andy, and she recommended the others hire Andy as part of their team. Once the interrogator leaves, Holly breaks into tears.

Once Ralph finishes answering the detectives, he calls Jeannie and says that he needs her to do something so they can pull off their story.

That night, Jeannie goes to see Grace at her home. She tells her that what's important is that when the police ask Grace about the meeting with Holly, Grace tells them that Holly said nothing about shapeshifters or anything sounding supernatural. Grace says that she can do that. Jeannie returns home and burns the chair El Cuco sat on when he visited her.

Ralph walks out of the Cecil police station.

The next day, Hayes visits Grace and says that they have avenues of inquiry in Frankie's murder. He says that they're reopening the case, and they've reexamined the perp DNA and had a mixture of samples that makes the evidence unreliable. Jessa and Maya listen from the stairs, and Grace tells them to go upstairs. Once they do, Hayes says that he's holding a press conference to announce the opening of the investigation and officially go on record that he's dropping the charges against Terry. He says that because her pending lawsuits against him and his office, he can't tell her the full story. Grace admits that she understands and ushers him out. Her daughters come back and ask if Hayes were mean to her. She says that he wasn't, and they hug.

At home, Ralph finds Holly packing to go back to her home. He suggests that he wouldn't mind teaming up with her again if the opportunity arose, and Holly tells him that El Cuco asks her about why she was open to believing in his existence. She says that her father was ex-military and when she was little, he told her that a man would know a man. Holly tells Ralph that an outsider knows an outsider, and they hug. As Holly goes, Ralph asks what else is out there. She just shrugs and smiles at him, and leaves.

Later, Ralph brings in his bags from the trip.

Holly goes to the funeral home where they're holding Andy's service and lights candles.

At the cemetery, Ralph tells Jeannie that he saw Derek and he spoke to her. He says that it wasn't Derek, but the vision told him to let him go. Jeannie jokingly says that there's no chance of that, and Ralph chuckles. He then tells her that the whole experience cracked the world open for him, and Jeannie suggests that after many years they'll just visit their son's grave. The two of them lay flowers on Derek's grave and leave. Nearby, Frankie lies buried.

Back in her apartment, Holly washes up and imagines seeing Jack in the mirror behind her. She turns but no one is there. Examining the back of her neck, Holly confirms that there's no sign of El Cuco's mark. She goes to her laptop and confirms via the Internet that Terry was exonerated. She toys with her hair and stares at the screen while the radio plays Washington Square by The Village Stompers, the song Ralph played when his mother died when he was 16 and that he heard again 15 years later on the exact night when his son Derek was born and that he told Holly about while driving to Cecil with her (in episode 8 ""Foxhead"")."

""We moved when the rent was due,"" jokes George, quoting a funny line his father, broadcaster Nick Clooney, always used to say. The family moved quite often in support of Nick's career as a journalist and eventual host of his own show, The Nick Clooney Show (1968).

George's career in show business started at 8-years-old, and almost by accident. ""At WKRC in Cincinnati there was this magical room, called the prop room, with all these costumes, and rabbit suits, and robot suits from the 50's,"" George says. ""I'd just go in there and put them on. I'd sit there, and my dad would see me in the rabbit suit for Easter and he'd bring me over (to the set) and put me on the show and interview me as the Easter Bunny."" George would often play different characters on his dad's show, and sometimes get a sit-down interview with the elder Clooney.

George talks about the success of his aunt, Rosemary Clooney, and how influential she was in his life. ""She was a world-wide star; she was a big deal. I didn't really know her. They were the California family, and we lived in Kentucky, and so I knew her a little bit. But she was this iconic figure."" The conversation then gets deep as George talks about his aunt's drug addiction.

David Letterman brings the crew to the Clooney homestead in Augusta, Kentucky (population: 1175) where we meet dad Nick Clooney, George's mother, Nina Clooney, and his sister, Ada Clooney. ""Hello and welcome to our home,"" Nick says while opening the front door and inviting the crew inside. ""The rest of the family call this, 'the house with too many pictures,' and you're about to find out why."" We see thousands of family photos, in every room, on every wall. Photos of mom, dad, sister, George sporting a ""best Beatles wig"" quaff of hair when he was 12-years-old, and lots of photos of Nick's sister, Rosemary Clooney. ""I think a home can't have too many pictures"", says Dave.

We also meet Hasim Avdal, an Iraqi refugee being sponsored by the elder Clooney family. He proudly shows Dave his new home, overlooking a lake, and tells us of how he came to be in the United States. Hasim nervously takes Dave, Nick and Nina out for a drive around town, jokingly warning, ""If you ride with me it is at your own risk.""

Back at the campus, George talks at length about how his father's generosity and altruism influenced his own work in places like Darfur Province, where he risked his life to spread the word about the atrocities happening there.

""The Future is coming... Science and technology evolve at an uncontrollable place. Unknown drugs and weapons flood our streets and schools. The contraband is controlled and distributed by violent, faceless, criminal organizations. The crime rate is an astounding 400%. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, law enforcement implements a new strategy: Every police officer is partnered with an advanced, combat-model android.""

John Kennex and his team fight for their lives in an ambush in an alley, taking on heavy fire. Kennex sees tattoos of thick lines on the back of one of the bad guy's heads. He orders two androids to lead him deeper into the fight, where he joins his partner, Pelham, who is badly wounded. He wants to know how the Syndicate knew they were coming. An android scans Pelham and sees that he is mortally wounded and cannot be saved. He refuses to help Kennex drag him to safety since ""others have a better statistical chance of surviving."" Kennex starts to drag Pelham away but there's an explosion.

In the eerie calm that follows, Kennex looks down and sees his leg has been blown off. His partner is dead. A faceless person tosses a grenade in his direction and walks away. It explodes.

Kennex dreams he is in bed with a beautiful woman.

When he snaps out of the memory, a doctor starts removing electrodes from Kennex's head and asks him what he remembers. Just the radio call from Pelham, and not much else. He wants to go again.

Kennex was in a coma for 17 months. The doctor thinks it's unhealthy to try again, but Kennex reminds the doctor he's not licensed. He's a recollectionist. Kennex wants to know who killed his team. He also remembered his ex-girlfriend, Anna.

Kennex leaves the shady place above a tattoo parlor and gets in his car, where he pops a pill. He has a necklace with an ""A"" on it hanging from his dashboard.

An MX unit pulls up and checks on him.

Back home, he watches a recording from Anna, mentioning that they're supposed to get married in a week.

Captain Maldonado calls him, saying it's time for him to come back to work. There's an armed robbery in progress, they think the Syndicate is behind it. Kennex stands up to reveal his prosthetic leg.

At work, Detective Valerie Stahl reminds Detective Vogel they agreed not to talk about their date at work. Kennex comes in and Detective Richard Paul immediately starts complaining, saying that Kennex oversaw the raid and all the intel and got his team killed. He doesn't think Kennex will last.

Kennex tells Maldonado he refuses to ride with an MX unit. She reads from his psychological evaluation, which says he has, among other things, PTSD and rejection of his synthetic body parts, but Maldonado wants to know as much as Kennex does who learned about the raid.

The same type of weapon was used in the robbery this morning, in which four security guards were killed. She tells him not to tell anyone else about the Syndicate connection.

Kennex and his MX arrive at the crime scene and meet up with Stahl. The thieves got away with programmable DNA, which can be used to grow organs in humans. The MX lists the other items that were stolen and when he says ""Myclon red,"" Kennex remembers more of the ambush, including that there were canisters of Myclon red there.

Stahl, an intelligence analyst, gives Kennex the reasons she doesn't think the Cambodian gang is involved.

Kennex pops another tiny red pill. Back in the car, the MX tells Kennex he knows he just had a seizure. And he knows Kennex was in an area with black market doctors last night. Kennex says he was there for noodles. He assures the MX there's nothing to report.

On the freeway, the MX notes that there were no food particles found on him last night, so he wasn't in the area for noodles. Kennex opens the passenger door on the freeway and shoves the MX out into traffic.

Kennex drops by Rudy Lom to get a new MX. All the current models are in use, so he gives him an old model that Kennex recognizes as ""one of the crazy ones."" Lom admits there may be some bugs because of its emotional programming.

They wake up Dorian, who's been off for four years.

The syndicate gets word that ""he"" is on the move. In a back room, a tech works on a headless android.

In the car, Doran tries to make small talk about Kennex's St. Christopher medal with the A on the back, saying ""something like 80 percent"" are given as gifts. Kennex knows ""synthetics"" are supposed to be precise. ""I'm running my colloquialism routine, so I express most data conversationally, man,"" Dorian says.

Kennex tries to get Dorian to turn himself off, but Dorian explains he just has to ask him to be quiet. They both hear Kennex's leg reporting the synthetic calibration is incomplete, but say nothing.

Detective Vogel stops to get coffee and is ambushed by a Syndicate team.

Back at the station, Detective Paul taunts Dorian, telling him not to snap.

Kennex gets word that Vogel has been abducted. He and Dorian interrogate the member of the gang who was injured in the morning robbery. Kennex is roughing him up, but Dorian says there's another way. He looks at the man's medical report and concludes he shot himself.

The man says he needed to get away from the people he works for. Kennex promises to keep him safe if he talks. He gives them an address to find Det. Vogel.

On the way there, Dorian speaks up. ""Not that you needed me to tell you this, but you just violated the crap out of that guy's civil rights,"" he says. ""Fantastic, I get the synthetic with the bleeding heart,"" Kennex says. He threatens Dorian to keep quiet about what happened.

Back in the station, the robber is being escorted somewhere when he says he needs to use the bathroom. He gags himself and pulls up a tiny device, which he affixes to the toilet.

At the kidnapper's apartment, they see a bomb in the hallway. The MX orders everyone back , but Dorian goes ahead. Kennex follows. It's not a bomb, but the trip wire leads somewhere. Kennex is impressed when Dorian volunteers to lead him in.

They find Vogel in a bulletproof box, with some sort of weapon aimed at him. ""Payback"" is painted on the wall and there's a surveillance camera. Kennex calls the officer transporting the robber and warns him the whole thing is a set up. But it's too late.

Whatever the device is that's attached to the bullet proof box with Vogel inside goes off. A gas is released, killing him.

Later they watch footage of the robbery suspect escaping after the officer transporting him was killed.

Kennex wants Vogel's blood analyzed. Dorian spares him a trip to the lab: he takes the syringe full of Vogel's blood and injects it into his own neck and the data is sent to Rudy.

Back at the station, they try to figure out why Vogel was targeted. Dorian notices one of Vogel's case files is missing. Stahl remembers Vogel saying he couldn't access this terminal this morning. ""They got into the whole system,"" Kennex says.

Dorian picks up on ""they"" and asks who he thinks is behind it. Kennex rudely brushes him off, calling him a ""synthetic"" again. Dorian explains Kennex's problem is he doesn't know himself and trusts no one. Dorian isn't like the other MXs, he was made to feel. They start arguing as Dorian suggests maybe Kennex should blame himself instead of an MX for his partner not making it out. Kennex refuses to argue with a machine and walks away while Dorian struggles to control himself.

Kennex gets a call from Rudy: Detective Vogel has myclon red in his system that interacted with the vaccinations all cops receive. The gas targeted his DNA and destroyed it on a molecular level, which is why his face melted. ""They're targeting cops,"" Kennex realizes.

Kennex brushes by Dorian and leaves. He goes back to the recollectionist and insists he put him back in. In the ambush, he remembers the MX leaving him and Pelham. Kennex starts to twitch on the machine, but in his memory he gets closer to seeing who threw the grenade. Just when he's about to flatline on the machine, he sees who it was: His girlfriend Anna.

Dorian injects Kennex with something to snap him out of the memory. Maldonado used his locator chip to track him.

Later, Kennex tells Dorian what he saw. When he came out of his coma, Anna had disappeared. Now he knows why. Kennex's leg starts barking at him again. Dorian suggests olive oil.

Kennex thanks Dorian for saving his life. Kennex is his one shot to be on the force; Dorian really wants to be a cop. Kennex acknowledges Dorian isn't like the MXs.

""MXs have no intuition. Or as you might say, no soul, so they don't experience memories -- it's just recorded data. My series is designed to draw conclusions, make inferences,"" Dorian explains.

Something strikes Kennex. Vogel's MX was fried in the attack, but it witnessed it. He wants to transfer the memory to Dorian and let him make the connections.

On a rooftop somewhere, the Syndicate bad guys attach tubes and machines to tanks of chemicals and set up a giant machine.

In Rudy's lab, Dorian accesses Vogel's MX's memory and displays it. The leader of Syndicate gang explains to Vogel that Vogel arrested someone years ago and took something into evidence that they want back, and they're going to take it tonight.

Kennex calls Maldonado, telling her to initiate lockdown.

The Syndicate team initializes their machine on the roof and it sends a pulse into the police station, activating the little machine that the robber affixed to the toilet. All the MX's power down and slump to the floor.

The lights go out. Kennex and Dorian run in -- he operates on a different frequency, so he's fine. The bad guys begin releasing the gas into the building as Stahl, Maldonado and Paul reach the opposite roof and take aim.

The head bad guy runs inside with a canister and sprays any cop he meets in the face, melting them. He runs into Kennex and Dorian. Kennex has to duck from the gunfire, but Dorian advances, unaffected by the gas.

The bad guy has to run, and Stahl runs into him. He's about to gas her, when Kennex tasers him.

Later, the bad guy is taken away in a prison jumpsuit and the same barcode tattoo on his neck.

The evidence room is a vast warehouse (like the end of Raiders). Maldonado and Kennex think they have to go through every item by hand. Dorian is trying to restore the sabotaged files, but isn't getting anywhere.

On a shelf somewhere, an MX head in a box glows with life.

Maldonado commends Kennex on a job well done. He asks why she requested he be partnered with Dorian. ""The DNR is good for you. He's special, just like you,"" she says.

In the car, Dorian asks Kennex if he wants ""quiet mode."" ""Not necessarily. Call me John,"" he says."

They head up to a hotel room, where a man is telling a woman ""just one more"" as he cuts off a small piece of her hair. The men bust in and shoot the erstwhile barber, then pack up his things and escort the woman out. She goes with them willingly. As they leave, they explode a grenade of particles into the air.

Later, Kennex and Dorian arrive on the scene. Dorian dazzles some kids outside by making his face glow blue. Kennex tries to impress them by jamming a knife into his (prosthetic) leg, which only succeeds in terrifying them. ""You have negative energy, man,"" Dorian assess, suggesting he's bad with kids and also likely has a problem with cats.

Up in the hotel room, the victim is Sebastian Jones. The men used a DNA bomb and fired absorption rounds that wouldn't have made a sound. They were wearing flash masks and took the man's bag. Dorian looks at the security footage, and while he can't see the men's light-obscured faces, he notices something about the woman's eye: she's an android.

Back in the station, they learns Sebastian was a high-end sex trade bot maker, with 23 patents, including one for the blush response. Sexbots are licensed and have reduced sex crime. Detectives Stahl and Paul debate the creepiness versus benefits of the ""bang bots."" Sebastian's company is in bankruptcy and his assets are in storage.

Kennex and Dorian head to the sexbot warehouse. Stahl calls with news. They found DNA where the sexbot touched, but it matched 23-year-old Nicole Bloomquist, who was abducted three weeks ago from a parking garage. They don't know how a bot is leaving human DNA.

In a parking garage, the two men from the hotel room snatch a mother, leaving her son behind.

Back in the station, Stahl has found three other cases where the same thing happened.

The woman's young son, Victor, is at the station and Kennex tries to get him to talk. He gives the kid an animatronic giraffe and Victor say he saw two men drive off in a big silver car.

They check surveillance footage of the car driving off, but it had stolen plates.

Stahl finds that Sebastian's former business partner Lorenzo is suing him he and just opened his own sexbot showroom.

In a warehouse somewhere, a man with an accent and an Eastern European gang tattoo on his neck checks on the kidnapped mom.

Dorian and Kennex visit Lorenzo Shaw's showroom, where scantily clad sexbots undulate on platforms. Lorenzo confirms that with Sebastian dead, their shared intellectual property rights revert back to him. He says Sebastian was constantly inventing and sunk all their capital into new tech and their biggest client dropped them and bankrupted them.

Their client was an Albanian group, but he won't say more about them. Dorian easily hacks into Shaw's network and gets information on them.

At a nightclub, Kennex and other police test all the bots for human DNA. The Albanians watch from a back room as the police find nothing.

Two Albanian men with the same gang neck tattoo come out to talk to Kennex, saying they stopped buying from Sebastian because they make their own now. Dorian and Kennex can both tell the men are lying.

Stahl calls to report they traced the sliver sedan to an industrial area. They head there and find a skinned sexbot, the one from the hotel.

In Rudy's lab, they find bullet wounds precisely where the bot's memories were stored. They wonder why the skin is removed. Kennex remembers the bots leaving human DNA and wonders if that's why the women are being abducted -- real skin would make the best sexbots. Rudy says they're growing skin from the abducted women.

Rudy digs around in the bot's head but says the memories are too damaged. He needs to examine a live one.

After the box autopsy, Dorian is pensive. He wonders how humans talk to children about death. Kennex says they say the same thing as to adults, that the person has gone to a better place. Dorian asks what Kennex said to his partner's son after he died; but Kennex didn't go see him. Dorian wonders who will miss him when he's gone. Kennex assures him someone he helps will, because he's a cop.

Dorian gets an alert that someone responded to the ""Dr. Richard"" dating profile he created for Kennex, in which he likes quiche and long walks on the beach. Kennex insists he meets plenty of women. ""I ran a bioscan and it looks like your testicles were at full capacity,"" Dorian says. ""You're scanning my balls?"" ""I didn't enjoy it, I just can't help but notice -- you're backed up,"" Dorian says. ""Don't scan my testicles. Ever again.""

Kennex explains his type: brunettes who are smarter than him. Dorian points out he just described Detective Stahl.

She calls with a location on the sedan.

Kennex, Dorian and a team of police stop the car. There's an Albanian at the wheel and a gorgeous woman in the back seat. She's a sexbot, whose DNA matches that of a woman abducted two months ago.

The abducted mother is heavily drugged and taken to a lab where she's injected with something. There are other women strapped to machine near her, also being injected (or drained) of something.

At the station, Kennex tries interrogating the sexbot like it's a machine. Dorian asks Vanessa where she was born and the bot recognizes ""Charlene,"" the sex bot they found skinned. She wonders where her friend is. Dorian recognizes she was designed to bond with people. They tell Vanessa they think she was being taken somewhere to be destroyed. She says Uri sent her with the men they found her with.

Kennex and Dorian head back to the club looking for Uri. Meanwhile, he busts in on the lab, where the women's skin is being harvested. He tells the lab workers to abandon everything.

Kennex and Dorian come up empty, but Dorian finds a microchip. He calls Rudy. He thinks the bots are made with a kind of tech that was discovered to inadvertently send out a GPS signal every time it updated. Rudy plugs in Vanessa the sexbot and finds the first time the signal was sent out.

The police storm the right warehouse this time and find Uri racing to close things down. They find the woman hooked up to machines. Vanessa's human is dead, but the others are alive, including Victor's mom.

Back at the office, Stahl tells Kennex he should celebrate. Dorian tells her Kennex can't, he has a date with a woman from the dating website. ""Benedict Android strikes again,"" Kennex tells him.

Captain Maldonado tells them that Vanessa will have to be deactivated because she was made with human skin. Dorian wants to be there.

He goes to the lab, and tells Vanessa she's going to a better place, but he'll remember her. Dorian watches as she's switched off and the light dims from her eyes.

Kennex goes to see his former partner's wife and son, Marty."

It squeaks and he remembers what Dorian said about using olive oil on it -- it works.

In an office building. James, the security guy brings someone a package. When he gets back down to the security desk, men with guns come in. The leader shoots James and he and his crew head for the server room. They drill into the floor and plant a bomb, then arm it.

On the drive in to work, Dorian is annoyed that John is late. He notes the smell of olive oil and enjoys that John took his advice. But John insists: ""I had a salad. A Greek salad."" John has Dorian hold two wires -- he's warming his coffee.

They get called to a murder nearby -- James the security guard. It happened about 20 minutes ago. Dorian accesses the security hard drive, they watch five men arrive and one of them shoot the guard then head to the 25th floor. Elevators are shut down. John calls for an evacuation of the building. He and Dorian hit the stairs.

On the 25th floor, the bad guys have taken the office workers hostage. The leader finds a woman named Jenna hiding under her desk. They activate their bomb in the server room. Dorian and John head toward the screams and see a hole through the floor.

Maldonado radios John, telling him to help with evacuation and leave the building. He hangs up. The police initiate a lockdown of communications, per protocol.

It was what the bad guys were expecting. The police set up outside with snipers and a command post.

Dorian and John reach the 7th floor and keep climbing. Dorian suggests accessing the air system on the 23rd floor and climbing up from there.

With the communications blocked, all the 911 calls bounce through Dorian. He answers, hoping to get information. A woman named Paige calls from the 25th floor. She's hiding in an office and sees the bad guys shoot an office worker and drag him into an office. They throw his body out the window down to the police below.

Detective Paul finds a note taped to the body: ""No cops, stay out.""

The cops send a drone up to the 25th floor with a phone to talk to the gunmen. The leader tells Maldonado to get the snipers away or he'll kill hostages. She orders them to stand down. He requests a fission igniter -- military grade technology. Facial recognition IDs the leader as Lucas Vincent with the Holy Reclamation Army. He gives her 43 minutes. John hears the demands through Paige's cell phone. She's about to freak out when John tells her a story about falling through the ice as a kid but feeling safe as his father dragged him to safety. He assures her she's safe.

Back at the station, Rudy suggests he build a fake fission igniter that will pass a scan. As long as they don't try to fire it up, they're OK.

The HRC has a history of similar attacks to get the release of several of their comrades, but they're not afraid to take lives, including their own.

Dorian and John are almost to the 15th floor when a gunman shoots down on them. They follow into the cubicle farm. The gunman spray bullets in John's direction with his semi-automatic.

John sets his phone to go off and slides it away. When the gunman rises to shoot in the direction of the noise, John shoots. He finds a trail of blood, but no gunman.

Dorian finds another gunman dead nearby, and a tiny translucent disk that says ""start"". Dorian took a ricochet bullet to the temple, but is functioning. He IDs the dead man as a member of the terrorist group, but then finds a device on him. It's a facemaker, which masks the true identity of a man named Gregory Stone, who's just an armed robber. (And an older white guy, not the younger black man the facemaker made him appear to be.) Dorian gets twitchy and tells John that due to the bullet he won't be able to walk in five minutes.

Dorian scans the facemaker frequencies and finds five others in the building.

Dorian walks John through how to fix, including cutting a magenta wire in his temple. John makes an attempt and Dorian twitches, saying that was the lavender wire. John makes another attempt with nail clippers and a Q tip. Dorian passes out.

Paige calls John, still worried. She tells him the men are spending a lot of time in a corner office. Her sister is Jenna. He keeps her calm by telling her his middle name is Reginal, after Elton John's real name. John finishes patching up Dorian, by chewing someone's leftover gum and using it as glue, and he switches back on. One of the gunmen reports in about Dorian and John and ""Lucas"" sends men to look for them. Paige warns John they're coming.

Lucas calls Maldonado, saying he just killed two of her men. She doesn't believe him, and denies having men in the building. He believes her. Her time is up in 10 minutes.

Paige watches as one of the gunmen threatens her sister, warning her to be quiet. Paige tells John she's going to go join her sister. He tries to talk her out of it, but she sneaks in to join the group when the gunmen aren't looking.

A minute later she says she has to use the bathroom and puts her phone in the pile of cell phones so John can listen in.

The drone flies up Rudy's fake fission igniter. Lucas orders a message sent to the other crew. Hearing the message, John and Dorian wonder how they'd communicate with another crew -- and remember the ""start"" disk. Dorian projects light from his eye through it and they figure that's why Lucas keeps going to the corner office with the windows.

They hear Lucas say they don't need the fission device. It's a diversion. Dorian scans the nearby buildings and finds a precious metals weigh station. They realize it's a heist.

One of the gunman projects a small disk across to the precious metals building that says ""10 minutes."" The robbers stealing the metals finish packing up.

Dorian hears a device arm -- a light bomb to kill hostages. Dorian decides he needs to act. He opens the elevator doors and easily pulls himself up the cables and into the air vents above the 25th floor. He quickly scans the scene then jumps through the ceiling, firing at the gunmen. He's able to take out several until Lucas hits him and the gun goes flying out of Dorian's hand. Dorian scrambles for it but he's damaged. Lucas reaches him and steps on his hand. He about to fire when the dead gunman from the 15th floor joins them.

It's John wearing his facemaker. He takes out the remaining gunman and saves Dorian .Then he calls Maldonado, telling her to kill the jammer.

The alarms go off in the precious metals building, trapping the robbers. Dorian disarms the bomb.

Outside, someone looks at Dorian, who is full of holes. John gets a big hug from Paige. He thanks her for being brave.

Back at the station, Dorian and John get a round of applause. Maldanado relays that the crew has been linked to several other high value robberies.

John takes Dorian to celebrate with noodles. Dorian thanks him. ""Hey, nobody messes with my coffee maker,"" John says. Dorian puts on some Elton John."

24 Hours earlier

John inhales noodles while Dorian gets impatient that they're keeping someone waiting. John insists it's rude to leave a Japanese meal before you're finished. Dorian speaks Japanese to Yuri, the proprietor. Yuri happily serves up another dish to John: something that looks like a slug, and it's still wiggling. Dorian dares him to eat it, saying he doesn't want to hurt Yuri's feelings. John contemplates the squirming thing and promises Dorian he'll pay for it. Then he scarfs it down.

A man gets a call from his wife Kelly and answers, with the video displayed on his palm. He tells his wife he's just stopping at the grocery store but he'll be home before she leaves for work in the morning.

He gets out of his car in the dark alley and goes to meet some men, including their android, who scans him for weapons. The man introduces his cook to the boss, referencing a man named Bishop. The droid tries the neon green liquid drug and pronounces it 84% pure. The man asks about his finder's fee.

Then Bishop gets a call. He shoots the cook. ""Whatever you're thinking you're wrong,"" the man pleads. They jam a rod in his belly button and pull out a subcutaneous wire. He's a cop. Bishop shoots him.

When daylight breaks, John, Dorian and Detective Paul are on the scene. They find the cop's trunk full of the drug Bendzopropene, discovered three years ago and made from algae in the ocean. It's called ""Bends.""

John recognizes the cop, Trevor Cooper, as a friend from years ago and is sure he's not dirty, but he wasn't registered on any undercover operation. Dorian scans his body and finds evidence of the wire.

Later at the station, Alexio Barros, captain of narcotics in the 25 division, drops by. Paul is sure it means they were already looking at Cooper for being dirty.

Barros tells Maldonado that Cooper was a good cop who was frustrated by not having the resources to investigate the Bends. He thinks he was working a rogue investigation without the department's approval.

Maldonado found an account under Cooper's dead father's name with large transactions. She tells Barros she has to investigate the possibility he was dirty. Barros asks to be kept in the loop.

John talks to Cooper's wife, Kelly, who says he took a day off earlier in the week to go up to his father's cabin. She says he was coming back from it the night he died.

John and Dorian head to the cabin, hoping to find the location to which Cooper's wire was transmitting. ""If I lived in a cabin, I'd kill myself,"" John says. ""You should buy a cabin, John,"" Dorian deadpans.

When they arrive, they find the place ransacked. John finds the recorder the wire was transmitting to inside the fire place.

Back at the station, they listen to the audio before Cooper was killed. They worry the amount of product Bishop wanted to buy means they could be looking at an epidemic. It's addictive and dangerous.

Maldonado finds 25 recent overdose reports and five deaths. John wants to go undercover and pose as a cook for Bishop. Maldonado thinks they need someone skilled in chemistry who can actually cook.

John goes straight to Rudy with his sales pitch. Rudy likes the idea of playing the hero. ""I've always got some ideas about my alter ego,"" Rudy says. He wants to wear a sophisticated European disguise.

Dorian and John pay a visit to Tony Han, a dealer they want to introduce John to Bishop. They arrive at a seedy club, where John warns Dorian to wait outside because they don't like androids. Seconds later, John goes crashing through the window. He suggests Dorian accompany him in this time.

Back at the lab, Rudy works on his cover ID. Paul vetos the fedora.

Back at the club, they find 3.65 mL of the Bends on Tony. He wants them to release a woman who was recently locked up in exchange for an intro to Bishop. John tells Dorian to alter the records to release her per officer's discretion.

In the lab, Paul tries to rattle Rudy to make sure he keeps his story straight. He manages. He tries to cook a batch, but blows a gasket off and through his MX.

Tony sets up the meet with Bishop.

John checks with Rudy, who chugs a vial of nasty liquid that turns his whole body into a tracking beacon, a new department invention. He keeps it down and his signal pops up on the map.

On the way to the meet, Paul releases animatronic roaches with cameras to follow Rudy. Rudy gets inside and immediately forgets his cover ID and introduces himself as Rudy. Listening in, Dorian suggests he go in to help, but he has to shut down his comm so a scan won't detect his police frequency. Dorian knocks on the door and Rudy rolls with it, saying he's his refurbished bot.

They let Dorian in and usher Rudy to the lab, giving him two minutes to mix up a batch. In his element, Rudy is confident as he mixes up a 94% pure batch. From facial recognition on cockroach cam, they ID one bad guy as Effren Cruz and another as Gavin Maxwell, the man who killed Cooper.

Bishop walks Rudy down a hallway and gives him something to drink. He downs it and they lose his GPS signal. John, Paul, Stahl and a team bust in the warehouse but find only Rudy's glasses.

Meanwhile, Bishop takes Rudy to a fancy new lab.

Dorian and John beat up Cruz to get answers. Maxwell isn't the Bishop. They find the vial Maxwell made Rudy down -- it's the department's own recently developed counter-agent for the GPS tracking liquid. They think Maxwell got it from someone in the department.

Dorian scans the system and finds Maxwell recently beat a major charge due to lack of evidence, Captain Alexio Barros signed the release papers. Barros is the Bishop.

In the fancy lab, Barros comes in and introduces himself to Rudy (who he doesn't recognize as a cop).

Barros takes a call from Maldonado, with the courtesy update on the investigation that he asked for. She tells him about the cabin, but that they haven't found anything yet. They track the call to another warehouse.

Barros questions Rudy's background, and he delivers and impromptu impassioned speech about loving the work.

Barros and Maxwell call the other men in the first warehouse and get worried when they don't pick up. (The scene from the opening.)

Rudy hears them start to worry when no one picks up and figure something is wrong. He flips the lever to release the gas and runs, cutting his arm as he flees. Maxwell and his bot follow the blood trail.

John and Dorian arrive and start shooting. They see Barros getting away. Dorian finds Rudy hiding and is about to help him when the bad bot attacks.

John follows Barros to a tunnel under the warehouse, but discovers he's out of ammo.

Dorian fights the bad bot hand-to-hand, the two machines wailing on each other with all their might.

John finds Barros down in the tunnel and whacks him with a pipe.

The bad bot gets Dorian around the throat and is short circuiting him by choking him, when Dorian grabs a nearby hook on a chain and jams it in the bot's neck, then hoists him up. The bot's body pops off.

Down in the tunnels, Barros gets John to the ground and is about to hit him with a pipe when John rolls over with Barros' gun and shoots him. Barros is telling John that they'll never be able to make charges stick because he's a captain. John shoots him in the head.

Back at the station, everyone gives Rudy a round of applause. Later in the car, Dorian informs John that he has to take Rudy to his cop bar. Rudy is excited to meet the ""badge rabbits"" and wonder if they'll go for his fedora. John informs him it's ""badge bunnies"" and warns them not to embarrass him."

Finally, he goes in and sees a naked MX -- his lower half is like a Ken doll. Kennex is slightly thrown.

Later in the car, Kennex can't shake the image. Dorian complains it's much worse to live with them -- they stare at him with their lifeless eyes and he has no privacy. He wants his own place. John can't help but ask if Dorian is the same as the MXs. Dorian says his creator was ""more thoughtful"" and unzips to prove it. ""Is that all for one person?"" John says, impressed. Dorian says he uses it for the same thing John uses his for -- nothing. Then he teases him about Stahl.

Captain Maldonado testifies at the murder trial of fertility specialist Dr. Liam Fuller. He was shot execution style at point blank by a high capacity assault pistol. The accused is Ethan Avery, and his fingerprints and DNA weren't found at the scene. Maldonado says two unrelated eye witnesses ID'd him.

In the holding room, the two young female witnesses wait to testify. One announces she's a psychic and a medium, then tells Hailey Meyers that Hailey's grandmother is talking to her. When it's time for Hailey Meyers to testify, she does so remotely from their protective custody. She testifies that she had just finished her shift as a nurse when she was walking to the parking garage and saw a man walking to the garage.

Hailey suddenly stops talking as she hears something in the hall. Someone blasts away the MX guarding the safehouse room door, then busts in the door. The people in the courtroom watch the video feed of Hailey fly across the room as she is shot. The psychic hears the shots from in the bathroom and climbs out the window as the unseen shooter blasts away the police guard.

The psychic runs through the woods as, in the courtroom, Ethan Avery smiles menacingly at Capt. Maldonado.

Later, drones fly over the woods looking for the psychic as Dorian walkd the ground below. Dorian picks up a heat signature and minds Maya Vaughn.

At the scene, Paul and John find no physical evidence. There was a tracker placed on the bailiff that led the shooter to the safe house.

Out in the hall, Stahl collects pieces of the blasted MX to bring to Rudy to see if he can reassemble it. The MX assisting her reports a sports score and John is surprised she's a fan -- he's taping the game.

Maldonado pays a visit to Avery, who is smug about the witness's murder. He points out he's had no visitors or calls and been in solitary, so he couldn't have ordered a hit. He coolly taunts her, telling her she's not important and is invisible to all the people she works with. She promises to make sure he never gets out.

Dorian and John talk to Maya Vaughn, who reports the dead witness Hailey saw who killed her. ""I'm a medium psychic- on good days I'm a petite psychic,"" she jokes. She had the cerebellex procedure to increase brain usage in humans. If she holds a dead person's things, she can communicate with them. Hailey says via Maya that Ethan Avery killed her. Hailey says she saw his face.

They report back to Maldonado, where Rudy joins them with isolated audio from the shooting, belonging to Ethan Avery. He's positive it's live and not a recording.

They've already confirmed he's not a twin and there's no file suggesting Avery might have cloned himself. Stahl suggests that because the victim was a fertility specialist, there might be a connection. They've never been able to establish motive or any connection between the two.

In the station, Maya is impressing all the cops with readings. Then she gets a message from Hailey.

Stahl meets with Adelaide Jones, Liam Fuller's former researching assistant on a paper about producing stem cells for human cloning 20 years ago. The test subjects were anonymous, but she suggests his papers might be at Fuller's mother's house, where they worked.

John realizes Maya slipped out when Paul went to get her a cup of coffee. Dorian scans security footage and finds her outside, where they pick her up. She says she's supposed to give Hailey's parents a message from her.

In the car, Maya tells John he has a red, angry aura. She has a vision of him in darkness with someone watching running and the smell of bourbon. John's dismissing her when a van pulls out in front of their car and men with guns wearing masks get out. John tries to drive away as they start firing. Dorian can't get out because he doesn't have his chest plate. Maya gets hit through the window, as does one of the gunmen, who the other calls ""Eli."" They leave him. John pulls off his mask and finds it's Ethan Avery, just 10 years younger. They were all clones.

Maya has a chipped collarbone and punctured lung and is in the hospital. They're stumped on how Avery found them.

In the hospital, Dorian says she was lucky, but she explains never has been before. Both her parents were killed in a car crash when she was 19. She got the procedure in the hopes she could talk to them again. But their house burnt to the ground while she was recovering from it and she lost everything and, with no items of theirs to touch, she has no way to connect to them.

Back at the crash site, an MX scans John's car and finds no trackers. John uses a secure line to call Rudy in the lab, where he's working on the MX shot at the safe house. Its comm unit is missing; the bad guys are monitoring police signals.

Stahl and her MX go to Liam Fuller's mother's house and go in to look around. Stahl accesses the computer files and finds cloning files linking Fuller and Avery. She tells her MX to send them to Maldonado as she goes to the basement. She finds four perfectly made beds. She hears a noise from upstairs and finds her MX incapacitated. She's drawing her weapon when she's grabbed by three Ethan Averys.

Back at the station, Maldonado tells everyone about the compromised police frequencies. She gets the files from Stahl's MX showing that Fuller is the one who cloned Avery and he was going to expose it. John realizes they were sent over the compromised frequency. He gets a call from Stahl -- but it's actually an Avery clone.

He wants to trade the original Ethan Avery for Stahl. He gives John two hours to come alone to the woods.

At the station, Maldonado tells John to get Avery and a transport vehicle. She has a plan, but needs Rudy's help.

She goes to get Avery and then broadcasts over the compromised frequency that he's about to be released. The Avery clones head out.

John arrives at the meeting spot in the transport vehicle. Maldonado walks Avery down the corridor of the prison as the cameras watch them. Rudy calibrates the scanners.

From the back of the transport vehicle, Rudy starts the hologram projection. It displays Maldonado walking Avery down the hallway, but it looks as if they're walking in the woods toward the clones.

The clones believe it's him and it's going well, but in the prison, Maldonado is running out of hallway. They need to get Stahl back from the clones quickly.

As they're getting closer, the hologram fuzzes out momentarily and the clones realize they've been had. Stahl whacks one of her captors and runs as Dorian and John start firing. Stahl makes it to safety, but the clones get back in their van and drive off. Dorian races after them. When he catches up to the van, he flips the speeding van over. Moments later, it bursts into flames.

Back in the prison, Maldonado gets word that Stahl is safe. She tells Avery he's going back to jail.

In the courtroom later, Maya testifies about seeing Avery shoot Fuller.

When she's done, she reminds John about her vision of him and promises the universe has a way of working things out.

Maldonado gloats to Avery, promising him his cloning accomplishment will mean nothing in a few years when everyone will have forgotten him.

In the parking lot, Dorian brings Maya something. It's a box with the evidence from the arson investigation at her parents' house. She touches the doorknob and starts to cry tears of joy.

At the station late at night, Stahl brings John bourbon from her desk drawer. He's catching the game he recorded. He realizes he's watching running in the dark, like Maya said he would be."

He's trying to get the doctors to act when he actually has a heart attack. He slumps to the floor saying ""they killed me.""

John and Dorian are in the car when Dorian gives John a hard time for running a red light. John tells Dorian he should try breaking a rule sometime. John sarcastically tells Dorian to write him a ticket, so Dorian issues one from his head to the system, telling John that insurance premiums are designed to keep people in check. They get called to the scene.

At the clinic, another DRN like Dorian is repairing the holographic doctor. Dorian thinks it's sad -- they were designed to be cops.

The victim is Leonard Lee. He was diagnosed three years ago with terminal congestive heart failure -- he should have died then.

The doctor looks over Leonard's records and finds nothing about a heart transplant. They review security footage, in which Leonard says ""it's almost 9:18!"" -- which was his time of death.

Back in the car, Dorian gets in the car with DRN 494, excited to take him on a ride along. John refuses to start the car, so Dorian does it remotely for him. ""You think this is the first time I've done this?"" Dorian asks. He throws John's words back at him, telling him he should break a law sometime, and John acquiesces to letting the other Dorian join them.

In the backseat, DRN 494 entertains himself by blowing air out his lips like a three-year-old. Rudy calls with a report on the victim's biomechanical heart, a top of the line Vastral Alpha. He finds a tiny chip inside the heart, but isn't sure what it is yet.

When Dorian annoys John with the same air-blowing move, John stops the car and tells one of them to get out. DRN 494 hops out of the backseat and runs -- at a man trying to get into a car. He tackles him. The man's partner gets out of the car and runs off. The car they were getting into rolls down the block into a fire hydrant, setting off a spectacular chain of events that includes it rocketing into the air and taking out a drone flying overhead, which then careens off a few buildings and dive bombs into an MX writing a motorist a ticket, smashing the MX into a car.

When Dorian and John reach DRN 494, he has a man pinned to the ground. 494 has ID'd him as Raphael Vasquez, wanted for armed robbery. From the ground, Raphael says he did his time and 494 should update his files.

""I gave him his case files back, obviously they're outdated. My bad,"" Dorian says. He admits he gave him access to some police records, too.

John hears from Maldonado, who is super not happy about the damage and the destroyed MX.

John is really angry and doesn't understand why Dorian is so set on making 494 a cop again. Dorian explains that when he was asleep, he just kept hoping someone would wake him up so he could be a cop again. ""You were that guy for me, John. I want to be that guy for him,"" Dorian says.

John relents, but tells Dorian that if 494 leaves the car, he's tossing him. ""I'm going to be that guy for him,"" John says.

Back at the station, Detective Stahl meets with the victim's mother, who says Leonard had the transplant a year ago in an abandoned building.

Dorian and John follow up at Vastral Industires. There's a donation solicitation request for providing the biomechanical technology for children. Dorian nags John into donating, since he has a synthetic leg.

John and Dorian meet with an administrator at Vastral, Pauline Rivera, who ID's Leonard's heart as theirs, but says they didn't put it in him. She says the chip Rudy found isn't part of it. Her files show the heart was registered to a woman named Sylvia, who died two years ago.

When a person dies, the funeral home is supposed to harvest the biomechanical organ and destroy it. They send Vastral proof -- in the form of a document. John is not impressed with the ""fail safe.""

Someone washes off a biomech heart.

Dr. Keating goes to meet an older couple, telling the woman, Amelia, that he can find her a heart.

John and his Dorians go to Trimeddan funeral home to follow up on Sylvia's cremation two years ago. They confront the crematorium worker, Henry, who confesses he sold it and a hundred others. He argues that the resale law is only there to ensure the biomech companies make money.

Stahl calls John to report that Leonard Lee made the same payment every month since he got the heart.

Rudy checks in, saying the chips were essentially timers set to 30 days, and if someone didn't reset them remotely, the hearts would stop working. That's how Leonard knew when his time was up. It's an extortion racket.

John tells Henry to call his organ dealing contact, Oscar.

Waiting in the car for Oscar, 494 reviews his files and wonders why he's not a cop anymore. Dorian explains that some were unstable. They came up with a Luger test to determine which were faulty, but the powers that be got nervous and decommissioned the whole line. Dorian isn't sure the Luger test was even accurate.

Dorian shows 494 some of his upgrades, including the fact that his eyeballs are now removable cameras.

Oscar finally arrives at the funeral home for the organ pick-up then takes the box with the GPS chip.

Detective Paul follows him to a warehouse. They listen as Oscar delivers the heart. More cops pull up outside. John has everyone wait and listen.

Inside, Keating drops the timer chip into the heart.

They hear Oscar ask: ""Can I watch while you cut her?"" The police rush in and revive Amelia. She's upset, asking why they stopped, she needs the heart.

Later, Henry harvests another biomech heart and gets a call from a woman, Karen, telling him the cops are swarming and he shouldn't reset any of the hearts timers. Henry's facing a wall of timers.

In the station, Oscar claims to simply be a courier.

Amelia tells Stahl the police didn't save her, they killed her.

On the phone, Henry tells Karen that people are calling trying to pay them.

Keating tells John he's not the one running things.

Oscar says he gets paid by electronic transfer every month.

Karen reminds Henry that if she goes down, he's going down too. Then he asks if she's at home and says he'll be there shortly. A name marked ""K. Lee"" only has seconds left, ""N. Walters"" has minutes.

A nervous Asian woman tries to get through to make her payment, but can't.

Keating insists to John that he's just helping people. John asks about the timers. Keating thinks they're for remote diagnostics. Keating realizes he was manipulated. He gives them the name Karen.

The police sit around the table and go over their investigation as people with transplants realize their time is about to run out and they can't pay.

Facing the screen of timers, Henry debates pressing reset. But he walks away as they all count down to zero.

Later, at the scene of N. Walters' and K. Lee's death -- they find bitcoin waiting to be paid. John realizes they were right, the extortionists are shutting down.

Stahl calls from Walters' scene and says all the victims applied for aid through the same Vastral program, but were denied by the same administrator for lack of insurance. The administrator was Pauline Rivera.

John goes back to Pauline to confront her. At the station, Maldonado shows her picture to Keating -- but he says it's not her.

At Vastral, Pauline insists she's the only one with access to the information. John notices her assistant is gone.

At the station, Keating IDs the assistant as the woman who approached him.

John and Dorian storm a house and Dorian's thermal imaging finds the shape of a body on the floor, and bleach residue. The idea of a body gets them thinking about how whoever's doing this wouldn't just let good biomech hearts go to waste when people are unable to pay, but they have no records of bodies being found without hearts.

""Who do we know who gets rid of bodies?"" John says.

Cut to Henry, about to incinerate ""Karen.""

At the funeral home, when John gets out of the car, Dorian tries to give his gun to 494, telling him he can be helpful in the car by following protocol if anyone comes out. But 494 won't take the gun, he admits he's terrified.

Dorian and John head inside and find Henry. He runs off. Dorian pauses and listens. While John is chasing Henry down a hallway, Dorian reaches through the wall and grabs him.

Back at the station, Stahl says Vastral is replacing all the second hand hearts at no cost.

In interrogation, Henry looks at Dorian and wonders what it must be like to have all the time in the world.

Dorian checks on 494, who's reviewing his old cases. He remembers a case where a man with a shotgun was in a rage and threatening to kill his girlfriend's son, who was hiding. 494 used his thermal imaging to find the hiding boy and, knowing it was a matter of time before he was found, went in against protocol and killed the man. When he found the boy, the boy just hugged him. ""That look was the most human connection I've ever had,"" 494 says. ""That was my proudest moment as a cop, I didn't realize how much I missed that.""

Maldonado comes in and sees the two DRNs and yells for John.

Later that night, John drops both of them off at 494s job. ""You're an incredible cop, I'm sorry you couldn't have been one for longer,"" Dorian tells him. Dorian scans 494 and takes away his memory of his cases he gave him, but leaves the memory of the boy.

When Dorian gets back in the car, John asks if he's ok. ""You know what would make me feel better? If you let me drive,"" Dorian says. John considers it, but says no."

After he finishes recapping, Dorian comes in and decks Paul. He apologizes, then explains that because the MXes have priority, he only has half a charge and ""it messes me up emotionally, man.""

Paul shakes it off and Kennex leaves for patrol, saying a half-charged Dorian is better than an MX. In the car, Dorian explains his ""personality interface"" is the first thing to go, then other systems. Dorian gets fired up about the social injustice of coming second and says again he wants his own place. John says he talked to the captain, but she said because Dorian is city property, he has to always be supervised, even off duty.

Dorian asks John about staying at his place in the back room, but John doesn't want to give up his trophy room. He spends sometime reliving his past quarterback glory days, saying all his old records still stand and they used to call him ""the white cheetah.""

A man, Ramon, drives home talking to his wife on the phone. When he drives through an alley a homeless looking person comes out to wash his windshield. Ramon rolls down his window to give the person money, but gets sprayed in the face.

He passes out. When he wakes up, he sees a bomb strapped to his neck counting down from 28 minutes. An automated voice asks him: ""Ready to play? Do not deviate from the instructions if you want to live.""

The voice tells him to open the case and go to the bank where he works. Viewers log on and start watching.

Ramon goes to his bank and asks a woman to transfer money, then pulls a gun, apologizing and explaining someone is making him do it. She trips a silent alarm as he leaves.

The person typing the automated instructions watches the viewer feedback, which is sharply cynical.

John and Dorian get the call and track Ramon. The voice tells Ramon not to stop if he wants to live. He speeds off, but the police disable his car with an electromagnetic pulse.

When they pull him over, he gets out and tells them what's going on. Dorian looks at the bomb and says he'll need five minutes to disarm it. There's less than a minute. He tells John to put up the shield -- a force field. There's nothing they can do. John backs away, promising the man they'll find out who did it to him. As he's telling them to tell his wife he loves her, Ramon explodes inside the shield.

Watching the online response, the man behind the automated voice loves it as people cheer and call for more blood.

Dorian scans Ramon's car and finds traces of fentenyl oxide, which would have knocked him out. The car's data recorder was fried by the EMP, they send it to Rudy. They find the bitcoin from the bank with the transfer. John notices the cameras all over the car and Dorian gets overly upset that someone would do such a thing.

Back at the station, Paul interviews the woman who Ramon robbed. She says everyone liked him, even though he was a loan officer who had to deny loans.

Valerie Stahl brings Captain Maldonado the footage of the robbery from the dark net. They haven't had any luck tracing it so far.

In Rudy's lab, he offers Dorian the charge he has; Dorian is twitchy and jonesing. Rudy warns John that Dorian's mood swings might get worse.

When John mentions that Dorian wants to live on his own, Rudy points out that living alone isn't all it's cracked up to be and it can be lonely.

Rudy has gotten into the car's data recorder and finds the last transmissions from the bomber were to an address, but it was more than 10 miles from where they intercepted Ramon, so he wouldn't have made it even if they hadn't stopped him. The bomb was very advanced.

Dorian is slightly more even after charging, but picking up foreign radio.

At the given address, they find a juke box is the only thing with power. They enter the code provided and the bomber types a message to them, knowing they'd find the address. He displays a woman named Jeannie Hartman, the next victim, and says they have to be the only ones to try to save her.

The bomber calls a florist and orders flowers from Jeannie Hartman to deliver. He reads the online comments, begging for another show. He promises one in 45 minutes.

John and Dorian call the florist and reach Jeannie's father. She's already gone.

In the florist's van, the bomber finishes installing cameras as Jeannie is knocked out with the bomb already around her neck.

Maldonado and everyone watch the feed back at the station.

Valerie wakes up and receives orders via text, telling her to go to a gazebo in a park and dance. The bomber plays music for her and seems to pine after her. He soaks up the comments, on edge about what's going to happen next.

Dorian and John find Jeannie and Dorian calls Rudy for help. Dorian's running at 48% power and apologizes in advance in case he says anything ""wildly inappropriate.""

The bomber texts John: ""The world is watching you Kennex, good luck.""

With three minutes left on the timer, Jeannie tells John she thinks a man named Simon that she met online did this to her.

Rudy stops Dorian from cutting the wrong wires and guides him to the right ones as time ticks away.

Jeannie tells John that she met Simon at the same park where they are now but he was creepy and she got a bad vibe, so when he went to get the picnic basket, she ran off.

Simon reads as commenters slam him.

Dorian gets twitchier as his power dwindles. With one minute left, he tells John to put up the shield and back away. Instead, John stays to help following the orders Rudy gives because Dorian is too shaky. With just seconds left, Dorian cuts the final wire and the bomb disarms.

As his emotional circuits overload, Dorian celebrates the moment with a group hug.

Simon watches with rage as the commenters mock him and sign off.

Back at the station, they've found that Ramon denied Simon for a loan and he was seeking revenge. Simon was in the police academy and trained with the bomb squad. He was kicked out for psych issues by Sgt. James Morton, who they now have under protection.

Maldonado sends a tactical team to Simon's current address. John assures her that Dorian is fine, even with his mood swings.

At Simon's trailer, Paul reports it's totally wired and they do a controlled blast. An officer tells John that crime scene techs have something for him. He goes alone to check it out and ends up getting gassed by Simon.

Once they realize John is gone, they begin searching. Dorian finds John's locator chip.

John wakes up at night on a park bench with a bomb around his neck with only 11 minutes on it. He's chained to the bench. He answers the phone ringing in his pocket. Simon tells John he'll detonate if John calls for help. His whole body is wired, too. Simon directs John to tools under the bench, saying he can try to disarm the bomb himself.

At the station they see the feed and recognize where John is.

Simon tells John they're the same, that after John lost his leg in the raid he got a bad psych eval, too, but John got a second chance.

Watching from nearby, Simon sees the cops arrive and threatens to detonate if they get near. The cops realize Simon can't see them from his video feed, so he must be nearby. Dorian spots him on top of a building. They line up a sniper, but then see that Simon has a dead man switch for the bomb that will detonate if they kill him and he lets go.

John drops one of his bomb tools and reaches for a token to try to separate the wires. There are less than 3 minutes left.

From down below, Dorian sees a path up the building outside of Lynch's cameras. He suggests to Paul that he climb the building and electrocute Simon, causing his muscles to tense so he can't drop the switch.

Dorian is only at 15% but says he can make it.

John manages to prop the wires open with the token so he can cut underneath them as Dorian climbs the building with a charge level at 8%. He's at 3% by the time he gets to the top. The online viewers keep rising past 11,000.

With 10 seconds left, Simon is ready to watch him detonate, but Dorian sneaks up on him and grabs him, shocking him. Down in the park, John disarms the bomb with 2 seconds left. With 1% of his power left, Dorian gets Simon in cuffs and powers down.

Later, Maldonado shares a drink with John, toasting to winning. John asks for a favor.

John takes Dorian to Rudy's lab, his new home. Rudy is super excited to have a wing man, although it's not exactly what Dorian had in mind."

The victim is murdered mysteriously by a new technologically innovative bullet.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Sam Hill'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"A man runs frantically through a crowd and down onto the subway without stopping to pay. He's racing furiously for the subway, but it pulls away. When the security guards arrive he shouts that ""they"" know where he is and are coming for him. Then a bullet seemingly comes from the sky and kills him.

John Kennex sits in his anger management meeting. He puts on a sunny smile and says he's ""all for sharing, feelings, but I feel good."" The therapist reminds him that his girlfriend betrayed him and set his squad up to be massacred and cost John his leg, but John keeps up his happy face.

After class, Dorian greets him. ""Hey, Mr. Friendly, how was Angry Class 101?"" Dorian asks.

""Call me that again and I swear I'll stick my boot behind your face,"" John says. ""Clearly it went well.""

They head to the murder scene. The victim is Anton Cross, he died from a large caliber bullet but there were two other points of impact.

Detective Paul's MX goes on at length to tells John there's a .0004% chance one bullet could have ricocheted. Dorian looks at the bullet and, seeing no floor residue on it, disagrees. The MX points out that Dorian is a DRN and an inferior model, at which point John puts his hand over the MX's mouth and tells Dorian to continue.

Dorian notes some sort of microchip on the bullet and says there could have been just one, but it didn't move by ricochet.

Detective Paul laughs as his MX starts critiquing Dorian again. ""You are continuing to listen to a retired old system, believing the rambling illogical theories of your appropriately canceled partner,"" it says.

At which point John takes out his gun and shoots the MX through the face.

Back at the station, Captain Maldonado chews out John.

John calmly argues the MXs aren't cops. ""If you force me to work with a faulty machine, I will dispose of it with the same degree of compassion that I would a toaster that burns my toast,"" he says.

Detective Paul warns John that he and Dorian better watch out.

Dorian studies up on Anton's girlfriend, Kira Larsen, who works at a software company with him.

On the way there, Dorian enjoys the fact John shot the MX because it insulted him, proving that John likes him. Rudy calls to let them know the bullet has a power source and micro electrical systems, and aerodynamics - meaning the bullet can go where ever the shooter directs.

At the software company, Kira says Anton wasn't into anything bad. She plays a message he left her last night, in which he seems distracted and signs off when there's a knock at his door.

Kira says Anton was meeting with a head hunter, Natalie with Kinsey.

As John talks to Kira, a series of holographic ads targeted at Dorian pop up for him alone. An employee confirms the company makes real-time tracking software for personalized advertising.

Dorian explains how this software could essentially track someone, due to a glitch. Rudy calls, the bullet was stolen by Russian gun runners.

""So Anton sold his software to arms dealers, and they killed him,"" John concludes.

A man watches video footage of Anton being killed and listens to a sales pitch from a man and woman. The buyer wants to see the bullet work, so the sellers decide to use it on Kira, reasoning that they have to kill her anyway.

Back at the station, John enjoys as Stahl fends off Detective Paul's insults about her rich parents. Dorian checks and finds no one named Natalie working at Kinsey.

John sees on surveillance that Maldonado is interviewing Rinehart, the leader of the Syndicate attack looking for something in the evidence lock-up weeks ago. She offers him a deal.

When John comes down, Rinehart taunts John, saying he knows where his girlfriend ""Anna"" is and if they give him a full walk on the charges, he'll talk.

Maldonado is considering a deal even though eleven cops died because she's worried whatever is in their evidence lock-up is worse.

Kira gets lunch from a food cart, where John and Dorian find her. They ask about Natalie. She's not sure about the name, but describes the woman as blonde with a Slavic accent -- the gun seller.

Meanwhile, that woman and her partner load up a rifle with the smart bullet intended for Kira.

Standing outside, Dorian starts to survey their surroundings.

The bullet fires from blocks away , around corners. As it's getting close, Dorian notices all the electronic equipment near him scanning for the same person and realizes a bullet's coming. He steps in front of it at the last second and is hit. He's OK, but comes up speaking Korean.

Later, Dorian appears to be in working order, except for the language issue. Kira is safe in a titanium car nearby which protects her from scans. John wants to take her to protective custody, but she asks them to bring her daughter, Amy, who is with a friend.

The bullet dealers scan for her, but can't find her.

John gets her and her daughter to safety. Kira admits to John that she was suspicious of how secretive Anton was, even though he was great with her daughter. Kira wonders about going to a ""scrubber"" to erase her memories of Anton, so the gun runners won't have a reason to want her dead but John doesn't think that'll keep her safe.

John takes Dorian to Rudy to get his circuits fixed so he'll stop singing Korean pop songs. They're planning to move Kira somewhere the software can track her then wait for the arms dealers to come after her.

Stahl calls to report that Anton had parking violations outside a bank a few weeks apart. There was an account there under Anton's middle name and a safe deposit box.

Dorian and John check out the box. They find torn up scraps of paper with numbers on them and a video chip. The video is surveillance of Kira and her daughter a voice warning Anton they can find her at any time. They realize Anton was being extorted.

Meanwhile, Kira leaves the secure facility without permission.

Back at the station, Maldonado shows them a sort of mini-commercial for the bullet, featuring Anton's frantic running and Chechnyian narration promising ""the magic bullet"" can hit a target from 2 kilometers.

They intercept a signal from Kira's personal comm.. She's at a scrubber. The bullet dealers find her, but can't reach her because she's underground.

John and Dorian find Kira, but the arms dealers are right behind them. A gun battle breaks out (with regular semi-automatic weapons).

Dorian draws their fire, walking down the hallway and allowing them to shoot at him. They kill the man, and take the badly wounded woman into custody.

Back at the station, they play the extortion threat for Kira and tell her Anton traded his software for her life. She explains the ripped paper is from when they met. He was old fashioned and wrote his number on paper. When she initially tore it up, he promised to keep it until he won her over. She gives John her pen, thanking her for encouraging her to keep her memories of Anton.

Detective Stahl brings John an energy chew and he takes out a piece of paper to write her a note, using the pen. She laughs at the note.

On her way out, Maldonado thanks him for not killing any MXs today. ""The night is young,"" he says."

He shows them a picture of a crime boss with his arm cut off, causing one kid to puke.

Late at night, a woman buys flowers then, as she's walking away, she is mugged by a man in a mask. She turns her purse over immediately but when someone shouts, he shoots her anyway.

The mugger runs but is quickly pursued and surrounded by cops. When the mugger raises his gun, the police shoot him. When the mask is taken off, it's revealed the mugger isn't a man -- it's a service bot that has been reprogrammed to commit crime.

Two MXes bring the service bot to the evidence locker and leave it. Once it's inside, it turns on again. It's riddled with bullets but still functional. It finds a classified evidence box containing the bot head of a woman. It scans her eyes, loads up on weapons and ammo, replaces its head and walks out, killing the evidence clerk on the way.

Later, watching the surveillance footage both Maldonado and John recognize the bot as an XRN (Gina Carano). The head has been in evidence for two years. The mugger was caught on purpose to end up in evidence to steal the head. The police go into full alert mode, saying a loose XRN is nothing sort of a terrorist threat. John suggests the XRN might be going for the Wall and could be the work of InSyndicate.

Dorian is stumped to find no record of the XRN in his files. ""As long as she's out there, a lot of people are going to die,"" Maldonado explains.

The XRN shoots a cab driver to steal his car.

John explains the XRN was expunged from police files. Not long after the DRNs (like Dorian) were integrated into the police force, they couldn't handle it. They became erratic, some even killed themselves. Lumacorps, the company that made them, was immediately in financial trouble. So the owner took the DRNs and remade them into more soldier than police officer. The XRNs were unveiled in a demo downtown with a bunch of big wigs in attendance. ""Let's just say, it didn't go well,"" John says. By the second day they set up a triage outside the building where they were barricaded and 26 cops died trying to assault the building. By the third day they had thrown everything they had at it and finally got inside the building.

There was only one XRN behind everything, and only her head was left. Now it's back out on the street.

Rudy examines the service bot's original head and reports it was ingeniously redesigned to have a hidden secondary power source, which is why the officer's thought they had disabled it and it was still able to turn on.

That means the XRN is on an old service bot body and will need to get a new one.

The XRN busts into a warehouse where sex bots are laid out under plastic. She rips the head off one and gets a new bustier-wearing body.

She hears a noise and turns with her gun drawn. The man (John Larroquette) recognizes her as Danica.

Later, John and Dorian are on the scene. Nigel Bernard is the warehouse owner. The man who ran into Danica got away with just a scratch.

Dorian sees the man (Larroquette)and knows he's not Bernard. He recognizes him. The man is excited to see Dorian and inspects him. He's Nigel Vaughn, the founder of Lumacorps -- he changed his name to Bernard.

Nigel is tickled to see Dorian is a cop.

Danica punches out a man in a parking garage, then removes his eyeball.

Nigel tells them Danica wanted him to take her to his lab, but he explained he doesn't have one. He no longer has a license to create robots, he just fixes them.

He can't imagine who could have programmed her to break out, but he suggests if he has his old lab equipment he might be able to track her.

Danica takes the plucked eyeball to Powerstone Processors and uses it to enter the lab, where she kills a researcher. She breaks into the vault and finds what she's looking for.

John and Dorian take Nigel to Rudy's lab, where he addresses Nigel as ""your highness."" They look through Nigel's old equipment which has been brought to the lab. He looks for a case and finds small vials containing his ""synthetic souls."" Dorian is troubled that he might share traits with the XRN.

Paul calls John to tell him that Danica stole 500 ZNA processing cores, which could be used to make more XRNS. ""Someone's building androids,"" John concludes.

John and Dorian meet with a scientist name Luther Estes who looks at the service bot's head and diagrams and says some of the technology used is still in the theory stage, but it eschews convention. He thinks it's someone young, but dismisses the idea it could be someone on the other side of the wall, because no one this smart would stay there -- at least not willingly.

In Rudy's lab, Nigel finds what he was looking for to try to track Danica. Rudy commends him for his invention of Dorian and the DRNs. He wonders if the fact he was desperate when he created Danica ended up in her.

While Danica is stopped at a light in her cab, a woman gets in and barks directions. Danica is about to pull her gun when the woman's young daughter tells Danica she's pretty. She reholsters her gun.

At the station, Rudy is able to trace Danica using the method Nigel devised. Nigel gives John an EMP spike to impale in the back of Danica's skull and hopefully disable her.

They trace Danica to a gala, where she has homed in on her target, Councilman James Hart.

John and Dorian calls ahead to the building but hear shots fired as Danica storms in. They reach tbe building with teams of MXes and go in, but Danica blasts everything in sight while staying focused on Hart.

Back at the station, Vaughn is nearly sick over the idea that his creation is killing people again. They suggest he go wait in the conference room.

At the gala, John sneaks up on Danica and drive the EMP spike into the back of her head. But it has no effect.

At the station, they run to get Nigel, but he's disappeared.

John escapes his encounter with Danica with only a few punches.

Dorian confronts her. When he asks why she's doing this, she says her ""sacrifice is necessary."" Dorian and Danica fight but she gets the better of him, skewering him on a piece of rebar.

At the station, they have no video feed and don't know what's going on.

Danica pulls Dorian off the rebar and is about to shoot him when John whacks her with a post. She quickly gets the upperhand on John and beats him to a pulp. She has him around the neck, but he laughs. He tells her he has the pin to her grenade.

He kicks her with his synthetic leg, sending her flying and out of range when her grenade explodes.

Later, they discover that Councilman Hart was in favor of decommissioning the DRNs and replacing them with MXes.

Rudy goes back to his lab to find the synthetic souls are gone. Nigel walks down the street with the case. He finds the ZNA processors in a trash bin where Danica put them. A service bot picks Nigel up.

They're scouring the city for Nigel but haven't found him. Maldonado is concerned about Dorian.

""It must be a hell of a thing to meet your maker, to be betrayed by him,"" John says.

Dorian tells John what Nigel said he did differently on Danica's synthetic souls and his: nothing. John assures Dorian he's not like Danica or Nigel.

John realizes what Nigel really wants to do is create more robots. Dorian suggests the best off-the-radar place to do so is over the wall, but Maldonado and John don't think Nigel is crazy enough to do it.

Cut to Nigel getting out of a van with his robot parts at the Wall. He whistles and a rappelling line comes over the side. He straps in and zooms up the side."

In the woods, the girl finds a bees nest but doesn't run, instead stands perfectly still as the bees swirl around her.

The music reaches a crescendo as the woman conducts, but suddenly both women collapse.

In his apartment, John wakes up from a dream about his ex-girlfriend Anna who led him into his ambush. He makes a note to himself that she had something to tell him.

Captain Maldonado calls about the two dead girls, both students at Mendel Academy.

John heads to the scene in the woods, annoyed at Dorian for telling Maldonado where he was -- after he turned off his locator chip.

They examine the girl under the bee's nest. She has giant pupils, just like Elinor, the conductor now in the morgue with Stahl.

John finds a sealed container in her pocket, but suddenly is thinking of Anna and chess pieces.

Both victims have the same container, which is only opened by their own DNA. But they're empty.

Back at the station, Maldonado tells Stahl the kids where ""chromes"" -- genetically engineered. She wants Stahl to talk to them, because Stahl is one of them.

The lab found an unidentified compound in their bloods -- and in the blood of Lila Hogan, a 15-year-old Mendel student who drowned five months ago.

John steps aside and thinks about his ex again. He pops a tiny red pill after his hand won't stop shaking. Dorian sees it, so, too, does Maldonado on video surveillance.

Dorian confronts John about the pills; he's required to report on John's physical state every 72 hours. John insists he needs the pills to help him remember Anna, even though they have bad side effects.

John and Dorian go talk to Lila's mother, Mrs. Hogan, who tells them her daughter wasn't genetically engineered. A PI she hired got recordings of her friends talking about being with Lila that night. The friends were Elinor Church and Scarlett Davis -- the two most recent victims.

Mrs. Hogan says she turned the recordings over to the police, but after Dorian finds no record of them, she says she was told they were accidentally erased. John finds that suspicious.

At Mendel Academy, Stahl talks to the only other ""natural,"" who says she wasn't really friends with Lila. She can tell Stahl is a chrome and says Lila aspired to compete with the chromes.

After John arrives, two male students are evasive about drugs at the school and tell John he wouldn't understand.

Dorian finds another DNA-coded tube in Scarlett's dorm room.

Back at the station, they find the drug was designed specifically for Scarlett. It was made by a chemical printer, which are highly licensed.

Dorian finds one licensed to a man who died seven months ago, but who lived three miles from Mendel and whose son Julian Wollenberg was expelled from the school.

Dorian checks the cloud files of the chem printer and finds records of all the times it was used for Scarlett and Eleanor, dating back a year. Their most recent doses were 1,000 times stronger than normal.

As they're driving, John has another memory flash, but insists he's fine. Then he kinda blacks out and crashes the car, nearly decapitating Dorian in the process.

Dorian and John visit Julian, whose mother is elderly and non-communicative.

Julian says they got the printer for his dad when he was sick. He's twitchy and hyped up. ""You don't believe me, now you see why I didn't come forward,"" he says.

John doesn't know what he's talking about, and Julian starts explaining that their conversation happened already and their words are in the air. Dorian can tell Julian is on the drug right now.

He says the drug ""expands the mind"" and ""enables you to realize your full potential."" Julian says he didn't mess with the doses and his machine was hacked.

John doesn't believe him. ""Now you understand why I didn't come forward,"" Julian says, as the conversation ends up where he apparently knew it was going to.

Later, as police descend on Julian's house, John remembers a computer science student named Marshall at Mendel, who could be the hacker. He had classes with all three girls. Julian says only that ""everybody knows Marshall.""

John gets a text from Maldonado to talk to him after shift. He lets Dorian drive home.

At the station, they look into Marshall's background.

Stahl finds an online conversation between Scarlett and her father in which he tells her to keep quiet and he took care of ""it."" After that she cut off contact.

After work, John meets Maldonado for a drink. She's worried about the pills he's popping to remember and says he'll need to talk to Internal Affairs again if he's remembering.

Later, John goes to see a Recollectionist for the fifth day in a row to try to remember.

After, he heads home and takes apart the Russian nesting doll on his shelf. He pulls up his investigation notes, including something about a keynote at Oxford.

He takes the dolls to the lab and asks a tech to run a secret analysis on them.

John and Dorian visit Scarlett's father, who hologram-conferences in his attorney. When they tell him they think someone spiked the doses and the girls were murdered, he gets rid of the attorney.

He explains his daughter and Elinor took the drug with Lila the night she died, but he told Scarlett not to say anything because he didn't want her wrapped up in it. He also made sure the recordings Lila's mother got through the PI disappeared.

He mentions that Mrs. Hogan all said they'd pay for it. Mrs. Hogan never mentioned she talked to the other parents.

Paul calls John to report they found another vial in Julian's house, but it had an encrypted image stick in it.

Back at the station, John theorizes that Mrs. Hogan mom blackmailed him to overdose the other two girls. He says Lila's mom rode her really hard and she never felt good enough, but he loved her. He says he didn't want her to take the drug and it was the only thing they ever fought about.

The drug works differently for chromes and naturals. He plays Lila's video, her last words, saying she sees now that she'll never be good enough. Then she puts down the camera and walks into the water.

They play the video for her mother.

John suggests the drug didn't kill Lila, but her mother still insists it did. He asks if she hired the hacker to up the doses of those girls.

She wanted the families to feel what she felt. She goes on about what it's like to be consumed by rage and revenge, and John sees her investigation wall that's similar to his own.

Detective Kennex and Dorian lead the investigation that forces them to interface with a house that is represented by a mysterious hologram character.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Thomas Yatsko'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Rudy runs diagnostics on Dorian while he sleeps. Suddenly Dorian wakes up and Rudy tries to hide what he was looking at. Dorian was charging then woke up on Rudy's table. Rudy insists he was just doing routine maintenance.

John tells Rudy that Detective Paul had to have surgery for an infected piercing in his man bits.

When they leave, Rudy looks at the image from Dorian's files of a child playing with a toy. He sees an error message.

Michael Bennett comes home to his Synturion protected house. His wife Linda is meditating. She's concerned about threats they're receiving about the death of a boy, Aaron Kasdan, at their house a year ago. He suggests Linda have their hologram Sam give her a mood stabilizer, but she goes for a swim instead.

While Sam watches over Linda in the pool, the stock reports Michael is watching turn to news reports about the death of Aaron, exactly a year ago. As Linda swims, the pool cover closes over her. Michael shouts at Sam to stop it but the security system does nothing.

Michael breaks through the house's glass door when Sam won't open it and uses something to try to break through the pool cover. His security system identifies him as a threat with a weapon as he frantically tries to reach Linda. He ends up getting shot over her as she drowns.

At the crime scene, Kennex tells a uniform that Paul is out for hemorrhoid surgery. The Bennetts died almost a year to the minute that the Synturion system killed Aaron in the very same house.

They don't think it was a simple malfunction. Maldonado wants to bring in Aaron's mom, who sued the Bennetts unsuccessfully.

Dorian leads the questioning of Sam, who is aware he was switched from auto to manual last night, but the record of who did it along with the security footage were erased. The Bennetts received 56,000 threats including 19,000 death threats in the past year.

Later, Dorian chides John for lying about Paul's absence. He's just taking a personal day, but John finds it mysterious. Dorian is still miffed Rudy poked around in his head, but John tells him it's just the price you pay for human connection.

At Synturion HQ, they meet a security bot version of Sam, who's being introduced to the market. Suddenly Dorian is frozen in place as images of the little boy Rudy was looking at flood over him.

It passes and they go on to meet Peter Newsom, Synturion's lawyer, and Kay Stinson, the CEO and woman who founded the company after she was assaulted in her own home as a 15-year-old. They insist they want to get to the bottom of the murders, especially with the new Sam bot about to hit the market. They mention a cyber-terrorist group called Disrupt who was vocal about Aaron's death.

John is harsh about the death of Aaron, who was shot by a Synturion laser-guided gun when he climbed into the Bennett's back yard.

At the station, Detective Stahl talks to Mrs. Kasdan, who says she was a vigil for her son at her church last night. Mrs. Kasdan insists she's not a murderer and took the company to court only to show people how dangerous the houses are. She says Newsom lied about her son and made him out to be a criminal. She doesn't know why he was sneaking into the Bennett's yard that night.

In the car, Dorian continues to see images of a young boy playing with a toy train. The images seem like him, but can't be because he was the child.

Suddenly, they notice the city start to go dark and building light up with the message: ""Justice for Aaron.""

Later at the station, Disrupt has claimed responsibility for the blackout. The police have warned other Synturion employees to turn off their smart houses. They've identified Crispin X as responsible, but don't know who that is.

Stahl, John and Dorian pay Rudy a visit. As a former hacker he recognizes the name as a cyber mercenary, not a member of Disrupt. He mentions the tradition of a giant party the night after a big hack.

Stahl and John head to the party in cyber punk disguise.

When they get there they find there isn't actually a party, it's a handful of people in a virtual reality party. They make their way to the back until they find Crispin X and arrest him.

Back in Rudy's lab, he theorizes that Dorian's system is making up the memory from fragments of things he's experienced. Rudy admits to Dorian that after he was decommissioned, Rudy used to wake Dorian up for ""yodeling, holo-chess, the whole mail order bride debacle.""

But Rudy erased the files when he learned Dorian was being put back on active duty. Dorian asks to have them, then assures Rudy that they're friends and he doesn't have to keep things from him. When Dorian leaves, Rudy clearly feels pained about something.

Back at the station, Crispin admits Disrupt hired him to cause the blackout to honor Aaron Kasdan, but they're not murderers.

Dorian brings news that Peter Newsom has been found dead.

At his smart house, Dorian theorizes the fire system was used against him. It's supposed to scan for signs of life before sucking out all the air.

John tells the paramedic that Paul is in the hospital due to an infection from his sexbot.

Dorian finds someone hacked the house to launch the fire suppression system. They find that Newsom received the same threatening email as Michael Bennett, with the same photo of Aaron Kasdan. It's from a social networking site, but they can't tell where. They think whoever sent it knew Aaron.

John takes the photo to Cripsin X back at the station and asks him to find the social networking tag on the photo in exchange for immunity.

Back at Crispin's place, he finds hidden files on Aaron's laptop, including the photo. The full version is him with a girl Dorian is able to quickly ID as Emily, and 18-year-old who was expelled from school more than a year ago. She moved to Arizona with her family shortly after Aaron died, but was reported missing a week ago.

Emily sends the same email to the last Synturion executive, Kay Stinson.

Crispin is impressed with Emily's coding skills but accesses her files and sees her records on the Synturion executives, including Kay.

John and Dorian head to Synturion and call Kay to warn her to lock down the building.

Crispin follows Emily's hacks and finds she has control of all the systems, including the Sam bot and life support. She's hacking from inside the building.

Dorian goes to find Emily and the server while John looks for Kay. She's hiding under a desk when a Sam bot comes looking for her.

Crispin overrides Emily and is able to disable the Sam bot temporarily. Kay gets away while the Sam bot lies on the floor, but then Emily reactivates him. She turns on all the Sam bots and launches the building's fire suppression system. Cripsin warns John and Dorian they have five minutes and then no air.

Emily sends the Sam bots after John while Dorian finds Emily in the server room. He tells Emily to drop the tablet but a Sam bot attacks him.

John asks Crispin to use the hologram system. He replicates John so the Sam bots have multiple Kennex targets.

He shoots two of them. In the server room, Dorian fights off the bot attacking him.

John kills the last remaining one before it can fire on Kay.

Emily gets the Sam's gun and threatens to shoot herself, knowing Dorian's programming won't allow it. She insists she's not the monster he thinks she is.

Crispin works disable the fire suppression system as time runs out.

Dorian talks to Emily, who breaks down crying and says Aaron was coming to see her the night he was killed. She lived near the Bennetts and was crossing through their yard.

Crispin restores the air with seconds to spare.

Later, at the station, an officer brings a donation for Paul's hemorrhoid surgery to Maldonado. She explains Paul took his mother to Mexico for a vacation and will be back Tuesday.

Stahl meets with Mrs. Kasdan and tells her about Emily. She shows her a photo mosaic of people Aaron knew online holding up messages for him in his memory, hundreds of people he was friends with, to let his mother know he wasn't alone.

In Rudy's lab, he tells John about shadow files he found in Dorian's processing core. It's not recorded data, they're organic memories from before he was reactivated. Rudy removed them and closed the insertion point so whoever did it won't be able to access him again.

Rudy doesn't want to tell anyone yet, including Dorian, because he might be decommissioned. ""Somebody planted these images in Dorian's head for a reason. We need to find out why,"" Rudy says."

Kennex and Dorian realize that the murderer is a serial killer who is using outlawed nanobot plastic surgery to become beautiful.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Frederick E.O. Toye'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Alone in his loft apartment, a man takes out his driver and plays some virtual reality golf, admiring his shot. Someone lurks on the balcony outside. The man hears something and goes to investigate. A disfigured man with bandages on his face attacks him. He uses something like a syringe to withdraw something from the man he's just incapacitated. The victim's face sags as the liquid is withdrawn from him.

At the office, John ignores a call from Samantha, his date last night. Dorian answers for him. John explains she took every call that came in -- she ""holo-blocked"" him. Dorian suggests John might just be boring.

Stahl interrupts with a possible homicide. The victim is a 28-year-old ""chrome"" named Brian Barrow, and chromes (because they're genetically engineered) don't die young of natural causes.

Barrow is an asset manager. He's a former Olympic swimmer. Stahl doesn't believe it was a heart attack. At Barrow's apartment, Dorian notices a tiny puncture wound that goes all the way to Barrow's cerebral cortex. Dorian withdraws DNA and injects himself to scan it -- he finds seven other DNA signatures.

Back at the station, they've found all seven other people are dead, listed as suffering heart attacks. None are chromes and they don't seem to have anything in common other than the fact they're attractive.

The hooded disfigured man goes to see doctor. He presents the vial to him and tells him to ""do it again,"" or he'll report him to the police for practicing without a license.

The doctor straps the man into a machine and injects him. The scars on his face distort and smooth.

At the station, Maldonado isn't happy to read about their case in the papers.

Stahl decides to go to a chrome club to see what she can learn about Barrow. Her fellow chromes don't like that she's a cop but were hoping Barrow was murdered so his death didn't imply there was some genetic risk to chromes of dying young.

At the club, Stahl gets stonewalled by the chrome at the door. The owner, Jake, offers to talk to Stahl.

In the car, John complains that a chrome murder is getting a disproportionate amount of attention and says it plays into his theory that technology is driving a wedge between people. Dorian agrees, and suggests they replace John's robotic leg with a tree limb, or a shovel.

Back at the club, Stahl asks the owner for their video surveillance. He's intrigued that she's a cop and mentions his brother, a chainsaw sculptor. He imagines she must know what it's like to feel like a disappointment to expectations, which comes off more understanding and insightful than it might seem. He says his brother is happy and Stahl says she is, too. He agrees to get her the surveillance.

At the lab, Rudy has gone over the ""vert-autopsies"" of the seven other victims, and confirms they have the same seven puncture wounds. He's annoyed they didn't warn him there's a killer of attractive people out there, he was a child model.

Upon closer examination, Rudy found the injection sites were the work of nano-bots. He found two of them in a victim and is examining them.

Back at the station, Stal finds footage of a man in bandages following Brian Barrow. On facial recognition he's recognized as one of the victims, and then as another victim around the corner.

Rudy announces that the nano bots in the victims read and reconstruct facial tissue, plastic surgery.

The killer admires a barista's emerald green eyes.

John and Dorian pay a visit to Dr. Randolph Amir, who designed the technology. He says the trials didn't go well -- it was stopping people's hearts.

Amir explains the syringe-like device is called an ""actuator"" and it injects the nano bots into the donor to map a part of them, then recreates that part in the patient, but the donors were dying.

Cut to the killer, Eric, bringing another vial to the doctor, who caused his disfiguration in the trials, trying to get one step closer to his ideal face. The doctor injects him with adrenaline to survive the procedure then injects the nano-bots. Eric screams as they do their work, then admires his new emerald green eyes.

In the car, Dorian starts in on John. ""It is said the more flaws you have, the more human you are. Have I told you how very human you are lately?"" he asks.

Stahl calls with news on the latest victim, the barista.

John and Dorian go to Chinatown to try to find out who might have sold an actuator on the black market. A crowd of people is cheering as two bots bare knuckle box. John assures Dorian he'll know his informant DiCarlo when he sees him. John asks a large woman if she knows DiCarlo. When she says no, he knocks her down cold. Her back opens up and a little person climbs out, annoyed at Kennex for breaking his exo-suit.

John shows DiCarlo a picture of the actuator. He tells them where to find a doctor who can change your face so facial rec can't find you.

John and Dorian knock on the doctor's lab. He sees them on his surveillance and injects himself with adrenaline. He goes after John when he busts in the door. Dorian pulls him off and tries to jump start his heart, but the doctor is dead.

He's Dr. Curtis McCann, one of the 20 doctors in the nano bot trials. They find an imagine of Eric, the killer. Dorian IDs his face as a composite of the nine victims, plus one other man's cheek bones. Stahl finds the cheek bones with a team and protects him.

Eric sees a cop outside his intended victim's apartment and calls the doctor. John wants Dorian to impersonate the doctor's voice, but Dorian points out he's only heard the doctor grunt when he was kicking John's butt.

Eric gives up for the moment and goes somewhere to watch a woman in a building across the way from him, clearly longing for her.

Back at the station, they notice all the victims live in the same district, where they would get 3D pictures on their licenses. They wonder if the killer works at the DMV.

At home, Eric chats with the woman across the way, Judy. His avatar is of his future face, nearly complete. She thinks he's in Arizona, but is excited he's coming to town to see her next week. He watches her type and gets a news alert. He signs off.

Stahl finds a record of a man named Eric Latham who did work at the DMV but went on disability a year ago. He looks nothing like the killer does now. The trials began a year ago. He's had 32 surgeries in the last seven years, probably suffering from dysmorphic disorder.

Cops pull up to Eric's building. Inside, Dorian sees the chat records on Eric's computer and starts a complicated search process to find Judy. John looks across the way and sees her through the window.

Over at Judy's, she takes a delivery and then is surprised to find Eric in her apartment. He explains the door was open. She stares at him somewhat blankly as he apologizes for his bandage. ""I'm sure you're beautiful,"" she tells him, then admits she's kept something from him.

He looks around her apartment and sees laser sights everywhere. She's blind. She tells him how happy she is that they found each other, and that she doesn't care what he looks like, but thinks they could be happy together. They kiss.

Then the cops bust in. Eric runs.

John follows him up to the roof. Eric climbs up on the ledge and threatens to jump. He says ""we're supposed to be loved,"" then plummets over the side.

At the station, Dorian asks John if he thinks there's someone out there for everyone. John says he does, even though it's old-fashioned. ""Do you want me to come to a bar with you and watch you drink?"" Dorian offers. ""No, thanks. It got a little weird last time,"" John says.

John turns to Stahl and asks her if she's heard of a bar called Leo's. She says she's on her way there, and Jake the chrome joins her. John bows out.

As couples walks arm in arm around him, John sits alone in a park."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3488412/?ref_=ttep_ep13,,"Detective Kennex and Dorian investigate a string of murders by a copycat of a serial killer whom Kennex's father put in jail. As the investigation unfolds, biotechnology from the future sheds light on crimes of the past. Meanwhile, Dorian receives his performance evaluation since being reactivated.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Sam Hill'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"At a homeless shelter, a young woman named Abby gets hassled by a man offering to share his pod for the night. A man in a wheelchair tells her about another shelter that might have beds open. After they get their food supplement food pill, they head over to it.

Glen introduces himself to Abby and brushes her hand, which hurts her. Suddenly, she starts to feel woozy and he stands up out of his chair and stuffs her in his van trunk.

At the station in yearly review, both Maldonado and John Kennex rave about Dorian. Rudy argues that Dorian doesn't need to undergo the Luger test to see if he's emotionally fit for duty. Dorian speaks to the panel with his usual blissed-out mellow attitude and tells them being a cop is the best thing that ever happened to him. Afterward, John harshes his buzz by telling him it took a lot longer than usual.

In the car, John further messes with Dorian by saying he told the panel the truth: that Dorian has no concept of personal space, that he scanned John's balls, that he abducted a DRN from a hospital, and that he exposed himself to John. (All true, out of context.)

John finally gives him a break and admits he's messing with him.

At the crime scene, they find Abby's lifeless body. She was dumped there. John finds straw next to her body and finds she was sewn up. She's stuffed with straw. John recognizes it from a case 10 years ago involving ""the Straw Man,"" Michael Costa -- a black man, unlike the white man who posed as disabled. The investigating officer was Edward Kennex, John's father. It was the collar of his career -- right before he was killed.

Back at the station, John is denied access to his dad's case notes, which he finds strange. Dorian reminds him his father was still under investigation for selling seized robotic tech at the time.

Maldonado runs down the case. Just like the Straw Man did, the killer removed all of her internal organs, including the brain, and replaced them with straw. They never find the organs.

The killer is a copy cat, and could be a schizophrenic psychopath like Costa. Dorian suggests they find out who Costa has been talking to in prison.

John asks Maldonado for permission to access his father's files and she promises to take care of it.

At the prison, the warden explains that Costa failed the red line test for mental disorder as a child but is a model prisoner now that he's on medication.

Dorian and John talk to Michael Costa in his cell, behind a force field. He's peaceful and calm and says he would have blackouts but he knows in his heart he didn't commit the crimes. He gave up after the fifth appeal. He tells them Detective Kennex came to him at one point and said he believed he was framed.

Dorian checks the visitor log but doesn't find John's dad. John goes along with it. Costa says Edward Kennex told him he was working on an angle about robotics and crooked cops, but he was killed in the line of duty two months later. He knew no one would believe him after Kennex died so he dropped it.

On their way out, John tells Dorian he recognized a name in the visitor log as an alias of his father's. If Edward was right, it means the original killer is back.

Meanwhile, the Straw Man in a wheelchair approaches another homeless woman in line for a shelter, offering to show her to a better one.

Back at the station, Detective Stahl says the stitching on the current and past victims is the exact same technique. She suggests it might not be a copycat. John keeps his thoughts to himself.

Maldonado calls him in and gives him his father's case file, which was sealed by Internal Affairs.

John tells Dorian he doesn't want to tell the rest of the department because some of the same people who were working with his father 10 years ago are still there. And he wants to go over his father's files by himself.

Dorian goes to examine the victim's body in Rudy's lab. He finds the puncture wound on her index finger. Dorian tells Rudy he got a call back from the review board, which is a little unorthodox. He advises Dorian to make them comfortable by acting like an MX.

Home alone, John plays the hologram of his dad's files. DNA and blood from multiple victims was found on Costa's clothing and he was found carrying a surgeon's knife. An expert witness said the stitching was expert. John listens as his father theorizes that Costa was abducted the night before the last murder and had evidence planted on him and could be innocent.

John notices his dad circled the victim's feet in the crime scene photos.

Dorian calls. John heads to Rudy's lab, where he reports the victim had nothing under her fingernails, not even specs of anything. Rudy has a theory that this victim isn't the real victim. John points out three weeks isn't enough time to abduct and clone someone. Rudy's theory doesn't explain that.

John looks at the victim's feet. Dorian says she's flatfooted.

Rudy breaks out his organic 3D printer and explains that bioprinters more than five years old couldn't do feet arches because they print from top to bottom and the material settles, leaving the copies flat-footed.

Providing a victim's body means the police stop looking. They think the victims could be alive.

At a warehouse dock somewhere, the latest kidnap victim wakes up strapped to a table and sees a replica of herself being printed.

At the station, Dorian catches Stahl and Paul up on their theory. The straw was used not out of some sort of psychopathic urge, but because bioprinters can't make organs.

John tells Maldonado his father's theory and mistrust of the department, that he was trying to prove Costa's innocence and it was related to stolen robotics.

Dorian interrupts with a report of another body.

At the scene, Dorian sees the same pinprick on her finger and they connect it to the blood draws at shelters for the supplements.

Maldonado sends a heavy police presence to all the shelters but two to try to drive the Straw Man there. Detectives go undercover at the others.

Paul chats up a homeless young man in blue neon sunglasses and gives him bitcoin to go get a place to stay.

Waiting in the car, Dorian asks John about his dad. He tells a story about his dad refusing to take a cut of drug bust money, even when his commanding officer put a gun to his head. A few months later, his entire dirty unit got busted except for him.

At a shelter, the Straw Man is about to run his routine, but leaves when he sees an MX.

At the shelter where Paul is staked out, he notices blue neon sunglasses on the ground and a van driving away. He calls it in.

A drone follows it and shows a body in the back.

The Straw Man is about to unload his next victim when he sees the drone.

Using facial recognition, Stahl IDs him as Glen Dunbar, with a background of trading illegal tech on the black market.

John and Dorian pull up on the dock warehouse with teams of police. They find the young man alive in the back of the van, but unconscious.

The Straw Man runs side and grabs a gun as police storm the place. John opens a container inside and finds a body with wires running into it. Dorian finds the two most recent victims still alive in other canisters. MXes carry them to safety outside.

John sends Dorian to investigate a report of shots fired. John explores the warehouse alone in the dark with his flashlight and gun drawn.

MXes come up on the Straw Man's body, down on the ground. Dorian scans it and finds it's a duplicate with a bomb inside.

He radios John, who turns around and gets a board in the face. The Straw Man attacks him. John grabs a knife and stabs him in the chest but he keeps coming. John empties his gun into him and blue sparks fly.

Dorian examines the body and finds human tissue fused with biotech. He's been made into a cyborg.

Going over the Straw Man's equipment, they find most of it is stolen from the evidence room -- the crime John's father was accused of. Dorian checks his records and finds Silas Grant, the officer in charge of the evidence room at the time, was killed three weeks after John's father.

Back at the station, Stahl explains the Straw Man had a degenerative disease he was trying to slow with robotics. His victims were test subjects. The tech lasted for 10 years and started to break down so he needed new test subjects, so he started killing again.

John reports to Maldonado. They think Grant was setting Edward Kennex up for the thefts and both were killed by the Straw Man. Michael Costa is being released from prison.

Dorian goes in for his review board call back, acting like an MX. But the reviewer tells him his term is being renewed following his glowing reviews, especially from John, who credited Dorian with being the reason he wants to stay on the force.

In Chinatown, Dorian finds John. He presents him with a wrapped leg-shaped thank you gift that's a serious upgrade from what John has now. He got it through Rudy. John is touched.

Dorian mentions the credit John gave him for wanting to stay on the force and gets choked up, annoying John. And then they're called to the next case."

However, the law only allows two children per family and when the police officers...

For starters, the planet is yellow, having been all but destroyed by environmental disaster. Humans, including Jim Shannon, walk through a ruined metropolis wearing breathing masks. Jim returns to his family's apartment and shows off a rare find: a shiny orange. Son Josh is impressed as is wife Elisabeth, a doctor of some kind who notes that the environmental conditions are causing more and more maladies. Suddenly, daughter Maddy bursts into the cramped apartment and warns that ""They're on their way now!""

Elisabeth immediately races to hide toddler-aged Zoe in a secret cabinet. They've clearly done this before. The cops demand to search the premises. It's implied that Jim is a cop, too -- but it doesn't matter to the authoritarian goons, who violently toss the place. Finally, the cops hear faint crying. They remove a grate and find a crying Zoe. Jim goes crazy, PUNCHING and KICKING the cops. It ends badly, however. How badly?

Cut to an industrial prison -- TWO YEARS LATER. Elisabeth pays Jim a visit. Through tears, she explains that she has been contacted by the ""recruitment people for Terra Nova."" Jim is overjoyed by the news. ""You've got to take the kids and go,"" he says. But Elisabeth explains that she won't be allowed to take Zoe, who is an illegal third child on overpopulated Earth. ""There has to be another way,"" Jim says. Whispers Elisabeth: ""There is ..."" She then convinces the guard to let her give Jim a breathing device. Later, he opens a flap on the breathing device to find a small, hidden tool. The tool emits a laser that cuts through his tin cup. Jim smiles. His wife has given him a chance to escape.

CUT to Elisabeth, Josh and Maddy entering a crowded boarding area bound for Terra Nova. Meanwhile, Jim has apparently already made it out of the maximum security prison and is riding a bus. He performs a little self surgery to remove a red blinking chip from beneath the skin on his arm. He exits the bus and heads purposely to a street corner, where he finds a VERY large backpack with an ID badge, a gun, and wads of cash. CUT to Josh, who takes time to say goodbye to his girlfriend. He promises to find a way to bring her to Terra Nova, but she insists that such a development would be impossible.

In the meantime, Jim uses his phony ID to get past security. A wristband he found in the bag gives him further instructions to pay off a maintenance man, who lets him into the interior of the complex through a back entrance. Unfortunately, Jim's sneaky presence doesn't go unnoticed by a security video. Jim then catches up to his Elisabeth, Maddy and Josh, who try to restrain their joy upon seeing him again. ""Whatever happens, keep moving,"" Jim tells his family moments before a security guard asks Jim to step out of line. Meanwhile, a large group of citizens continues to walk toward a big glowing gate that ZAPS them into another place and time. Elisabeth convinces her son and daughter to step through the gate before walking through herself. The moment Elisabeth has disappeared, Jim HITS the guard and runs for it. He PLUNGES through the gate ...

... and emerges in a lushly wooded area surrounded by his fellow travelers. Unfortunately, a group of armed guards in camo notice that Jim is carrying a weapon. They draw their own weapons. They demand to search Jim's backpack, which -- of course -- contains a hiding Zoe. Elisabeth EMBRACES her daughter as Jim wards off the guards. So what is this Terra Nova? Well, it's seemingly a paradise that has been virtually untouched by man. As the travelers are led through the jungle, Elisabeth wonders if the authorities will make Jim serve out his sentence. Jim's answer gives us our first clue as to where -- and when -- we are. ""I hope not"" he says. ""I'm not scheduled to be released for another 85 million years."" Suddenly, a huge ROAR echoes through the foliage. Hmmm.

The Shannon family, along with the rest of the new arrivals, soon arrive at an enormous and circular shaped city -- all the buildings constructed from lumber, but defended with very modern weapons. Just then, Nathaniel Taylor, the colony leader, emerges from his compound to greet the new citizens. ""Congratulations, each one of you has taken a new step -- just as I did seven years ago -- toward a new beginning,"" he says. Taylor explains how humanity ""blew it"" by destroying its home. Now, a second chance to ""get it right"" in Terra Nova. Everyone claps. Later, Jim and Elisabeth are brought before Taylor, who relaxes behind a table made from a huge dinosaur skull. He explains that he doesn't care about laws from ""another time."" He just wants people who will be of use.

Elisabeth is a doctor, but how will Jim be of use? ""There must be some bad guys around here that need catching,"" says Jim, who explains that he used to be a narcotics officer in Chicago. Taylor gruffly assigns Jim to ""agricultural duty."" The family then explores its new house, which is big and open and practically glowing. Jim worries that Zoe doesn't even know him, but the dad is soon making his youngest daughter giggle. It's a touching moment, capped by Zoe calling Jim ""daddy."" Josh doesn't buy into the good feelings, however. ""I guess we're supposed to forget about the years we had to fend for ourselves because dad was in jail!"" says the petulant teenager. ""If he hadn't lost his cool and punched that cop, he might have gotten off with a fine. Ever think about that?!""

Mom and dad tell Josh to cool down, so he sulks. Zoe, meanwhile, has wondered outside and is staring with wonder at a brachiosaur who eats leaves from her hand. The camera pulls back to reveal a herd of the long-necked big guys. The next morning, dad heads to work, mom heads to work and the kids head to new citizen orientation. Maddy then marvels at a shrine of sorts to the original ""probe,"" which identified the existence of Terra Nova. She then explains to her slacker brother that Terra Nova exists in the distant past of an alternate universe. So nothing they do -- like step on a butterfly -- will result in their never having been born. Convenient. Josh then decides to skip orientation and soon runs into a perky young blond named Skye. Perhaps he can forget his old GF, after all.

Skye then takes Josh to a hole in the massive fence. They slip out into the woods and find fellow teenage risk seekers Tasha, Hunter and Max. The new gang heads out for an adventure, which involves leaping off a waterfall into the water below. Josh takes the plunge and swims with his new friend. Skye then shows Josh a series of strange gold symbols that have seemingly been carved into the rock. ""I think they're equations, but I can't be sure,"" Skye says. The place, meanwhile, is off limits. ""It's like Taylor doesn't want anybody to know about this. Um, don't tell anyone about this, OK?"" Josh agrees.

Sometime later, Elisabeth is working on a patient who has been shot. He and his buddies were apparently stealing from the power grid. Why? Because they are ""sixers,"" a security guard explains. Before he can explain the term, the patient leaps out up and holds a knife to Elisabeth's throat. He demands the guard slide over his gun. The guard complies and the ""sixer"" takes the weapon and flees. Outside, Jim is getting agricultural lessons when he notices the ""sixer"" walking fast through the camp. Jim's cop senses apparently begin to tingle as he opts to follow the fellow. Good thing, too, because Jim notices when the ""sixer"" pulls a weapon and aims it at Taylor. Just as Taylor is about to assassinated, Jim TACKLES the ""sixer,"" who is led off the brig in handcuffs. Taylor invites Jim for a hike.

The pair of macho men climb up a waterfall as Taylor explains that the ""sixers"" are a split-off settlement that all arrived with the sixth batch of Terra Nova immigrants. One day, the group decided to make their own society -- taking a considerable amount of supplies and weapons with them. No one knows exactly why. ""Until we know who sent those people back and why, I don't know who in the future I can trust,"" Taylor explains. They then climb a rock and take in the view of Terra Nova from high above. ""This is what we're fighting for, Jim,"" says Taylor before inviting ex-cop to join his security forces. Just then, Taylor notices Sixer Jeeps approaching Terra Nova. Trouble!

CUT to Taylor and Jim chasing the armed Jeeps in their own all-terrain vehicle. A FURIOUS chase ensues ... and is soon joined by a toothy dinosaur! ""Carnotaurus,"" Taylor deadpans. ""I hate carnotaurus."" The beast snaps a few Sixers out of their vehicles and then continues to chase Taylor and Jim. ""Take the wheel!"" shouts Taylor, who jumps out of the vehicle to face down the ""Carno"" mano y dino. This gives the security guard at the gates of Terra Nova just enough time to ready their weapons. Taylor then leaps back into the vehicle and tells Jim to step on it. They speed through the closing gates of Terra Nova as weapons above FIRE at the Carno, who thinks better of it and flees.

After the smoke has cleared, Taylor confronts the Sixers, who have approach the gates. A particularly tough woman named Mira demands the return of her Sixer friend from the Terra Nova brig. She also implies that the Sixers have spies inside the complex before proposing a trade: the prisoner and medical supplies for a big box of meteoric iron. Taylor accepts. Apparently, the Sixers control the quarry. Later, Taylor and Elisabeth have a heart to heart at the medical tent. The good doctor explains that she wanted a better life for her children. Taylor understands. He wanted the same for his own son. Alas, Taylor's son went missing some years ago. Dad still hopes the boy will return.

Meanwhile, Tasha, Hunter, Max and Skye introduce Josh to a makeshift ""moonshine"" still outside the gate. Everybody but Skye and Josh go off into the woods to search for supplies. The lovebirds chat -- i.e. Josh complains about this family -- when they hear a animal shriek in the distance. Not good. Back at Terra Nova, Taylor calls Jim into the surveillance room and shows him security footage of Josh and Skye sneaking out of the fence. ""If we don't get to them pretty quick, something else might,"" Taylor tells the worried father. CUT to the teens, who discover that the rover they stole is missing its power cell. The Sixers stole it before disappearing (actually, they were killed by a ""slasher,"" though the teens don't know it. Luckily, the Sixer vehicle is nearby.

They race toward the seemingly abandoned vehicle as they hear another shriek. The slasher dinosaur is getting closer. Skye opens the door to find a Sixer inside. She apparently remembers him from his time in Terra Nova and convinces the man to let the teens inside. They slam the door to the vehicle just as the slasher leaps from the underbrush with a loud SHRIEK, SLAMMING into the side of the armored car.

Night falls. Elisabeth insists on heading out with Jim, Taylor and the security team to search for the teens. Taylor attempts to comfort the terrified parents by telling them that he was the first to arrive at Terra Nova -- and spent more than 100 days defending himself against the dinosaurs and elements before more men arrived. The lesson? ""This jungle can be survived,"" Taylor concludes. Meanwhile, Slashers surround the rover. The teens use their weapons to open fire. It's a flurry of SPUTTERING gunfire, FLASHING muzzles and dino SHRIEKS. Back at Terra Nova, cute boy Reynolds visits Maddy, assuring her that everything is going to be OK. Maddy is clearly smitten.

CUT to Jim and Elisabeth, who find a badly wounded Tasha lying on the jungle floor. Terrified, she ran from the Sixer vehicle and was attacked by a slasher. As Elisabeth stabilizes the Tasha, she explains that she crossed water after escaping the vehicle. That narrows the search area for the teens. Jim, meanwhile, blames himself for the whole episode. ""Josh came out here with these kids just to spite me,"" he tells Elisabeth. Jim then disappears into the jungle with Taylor to find the kids. CUT to the Sixer vehicle, where Skye explains that her father was a corporeal in Taylor's guard before he died. Josh barely has time to sympathize before more Slashers attack the vehicle. Hunter is dragged outside by a Slasher, which casually munches on the boy's leg before Josh and Skye use machine guns to scare it away. All the teens then decide to take their stolen power cell and try to make it back to their rover. It's a desperate plan that soon goes array.

Just as it looks as if the dinos are about to maul the surrounded teams, Taylor and his men arrive. Jim shoots a Slasher about to kill Josh and then tries to comfort his son. ""It's OK,"" Jim tells Josh. ""It's me. It's over."" Jim and Taylor then head to the Sixer vehicle and find the man gone. ""It's Mira,"" Taylor says. ""She came for her man."" Back at Terra Nova, Elisabeth greets Jim with a smile. The parents are soon joined by their wayward son, who apologizes for causing so much trouble. A big family hug ensues. Skye watches the embrace longingly before approaching Taylor. ""I'm sorry ... you've been so good to me since my folks ..."" Skye says before trailing off. Taylor accepts the apology and asks if the teens went anywhere near the falls. Skye lies and says ""no."" ""Good,"" Taylor says. ""Good."" What is Taylor hiding?

CUT to Mira and her man, who are examining the strange calculations. Mira explains that they are made by Taylor's son. ""Every time he gets close to an answer, he puts it here,"" the Sixer leader says. ""To remind him of the real reason for Terra Nova's existence: control the past, control the future."" She stares at the symbols. ""They're the key -- to everything."""

They hit something ... and blow out their tire. Sure enough, the leaves soon begin to rustle. They hear screeching. Suddenly, a dino LEAPS fro the trees at the men. Not good.

The next day, the Shannon kids and other Terra Nova youngsters get a lesson in survival from Washington and Reynolds, who continues to make eyes at Maddy. To prove how tough she is, Washington eats a few disgusting, but nutrient-filled bugs. Later, the Shannon family jokes and laughs as they prepare for bed. It's been another wonderful day in prehistoric paradise. Once the kiddies are in bed, Jim and Elisabeth get frisky. Their make-out session is unfortunately interrupted by a SCREACHING. Bummer.

Jim goes outside and tell the winged and screeching creature to scat. Returning inside, Jim finds Zoe has crawled into his marital bed. He is understandably disappointed. If it's not the dinosaurs busting his groove, it's the kids. The next day, Elisabeth goes to work and finds that Dr. Malcolm Wallace, who attended university with Elisabeth, has arrived in Terra Nova. They are very happy to see each other. Jim is not very happy that they are very happy to see each other. CUT to the jungle, where Taylor is on patrol with an enormous gun. Taylor asks Jim to investigate the possibility of a Sixer spy in camp. Taylor also responds cagey when Jim asks why the Sixers want Taylor dead. The pair soon comes across the dead and mutilated bodies of the two guards who had a flat tire.

Who did this? Or, rather, what did this? Back at the hospital -- and morgue -- Elisabeth isn't sure. But she does know that the attack came from above. ""I need to know what did this -- today,"" Taylor growls. Elisabeth (and Malcolm) has to work late, so Jim heads home to play Mr. Mom. He struggles to make dinner and gets even more flustered when Maddy asks how she can tell if a ""boy likes me."" Yikes. Sometime later, Elisabeth returns home and explains that fatal wounds to the guards don't match any known species. Jim then wonders if Elisabeth ever, um, you know. ""Are you asking if we ever dated?"" Elisabeth says with a laugh. ""Yes ... for a bit."" Jim is not-so-jokingly jealous.

Later, Jim hears the same SCREECHING as before. He goes outside to see the same winged creature -- joined by a few SCREECHING friends. Josh comes outside and throws a rock at the creatures ... and they clearly become angry, Suddenly, the screechers ATTACK. Jim and Josh race inside to safety. They are greeted by an anxious Elisabeth. ""I think we just found out what killed those men,"" Jim tells his wife. The next morning, Malcolm treats Jim, who has been bitten. Malcolm then suggests to Taylor that a science team ""observe"" the new creatures. Taylor decides -- roughly -- that no such request will be granted. Instead, Terra Nova will go under lockdown. ""Research another day,"" Taylor barks. ""No discussion."" Later, Jim asks Taylor how his wife was recruited to come to Terra Nova. Taylor explains that she was specifically requested by Malcolm. Hmmm.

Josh, meanwhile, finds a guitar at the market and attempts to trade with the owner. The owner inquires about Josh's platinum necklace -- and the young man becomes defensive. Later, he explains to Skye that the necklace was given to him by his girlfriend 85 million years in the future. ""She was kind of like you,"" Josh tells Skye. Suddenly, the flirting is interrupted by the screechers, who begin to line up on the fence in great numbers. Just then, the flying creatures ATTACK. Everyone dives for cover until the birds take off.

Afterward, Jim notices Malcolm collecting dead screechers. He explains that the creatures are probably migrating -- and likely as a species seeing as how the migration isn't annual. ""We're seeing today is just the first wave,"" Malcolm says. ""There are a lot more coming."" Indeed, radar scans indicate THOUSANDS of the birds are nearby. Taylor then remembers that, years ago, the settlers found thousands and thousands of eggs underground. It soon becomes clear that the screechers have come back to spawn ... and that Terra Nova was inadvertently build on the creatures' breeding ground. Uh oh.

Malcolm and Elisabeth then explain that they might be able to figure out a way to stop the oncoming hoard if they could study live specimens -- preferably a male and a female. ""Want to do some hunting tonight?"" Taylor asks Jim. Later, Jim prepares to hunt the creatures -- and takes a few moments to let Malcom know that his plan to recruit and then woo Elisabeth is as transparent as sandwich wrap. Malcolm, of course, denies his motives were anything but pure in bringing Elisabeth 85 millions into the past.

The next day, Jim and Taylor return to Terra Nova with two specimens (that's right -- we don't get to see the hunt, which was apparently simple). Elisabeth and Malcolm study the creatures and uncover pheromones. If the good doctors could whip up a batch of concentrated pheromones -- and somehow spread them elsewhere -- they might be able to create a new breeding ground for the creatures. Elisabeth and Malcolm get to work. In the meantime, the entire settlement has been locked down -- windows and doors sealed tight. Good thing, too, because the skies are soon thick with the SCREACHING beasts.

Elisabeth and Malcolm finally get the correct combination of chemicals, creating a vat of the pheromones. Back at the Shannon house, meanwhile, a few of the creatures manage to get into the house through the vents. Naturally, one of the nasty little beasts goes after Zoe, the smallest target. But the creature is BLASTED by an armed Josh, who locks his sisters into the sealed bedroom. They're safe ... for now. Jim and Taylor, meanwhile, strap the vat of pheromones to a car and speed away. The screechers seem to follow! ""It worked!"" says Malcolm. Hours later, Jim has still yet to return -- and Elisabeth is worried.

Just as Malcolm is about to comfort Elisabeth, they hear a car. Jim and Taylor have returned to a hero's welcome. Elisabeth and Jim embrace. Taylor explains that things got a ""little exciting"" (again, we didn't get to see it), explaining his multiple scratches and bruises. Later, Elisabeth and Jim return home to find their children sleeping. The parents smile ... and Elisabeth invites her husband to bed. Finally, they get some alone time."

There, he finds a giant dinosaur standing above him. The man -- now effectively the insect -- grins vacantly before dino CHOMPS down.

CUT to Jim and Elisabeth walking through the market. Elisabeth explains that no one has heard from a researcher working outside Terra Nova. She then boards a rover with Taylor to check it out. They arrive at the lab recently exited by the vacantly grinning (and now missing) scientist. Inside, they find strange notes proclaiming, ""This is not a dream!"" Worse, multiple people are locked inside a room, most strapped to tables and babbling incoherently. One woman claims to be in the middle of the Detroit food riots -- an event taking place 85 million years in the future. Elisabeth then finds a video recording from the researcher, who talks about ""pathogens"" and ""short-term memory loss."" Hmm.

Back at Terra Nova, Josh and Skye sit outside while he fiddles on the guitar. Soon, her hand is on his leg. He smiles -- and continues playing. CUT to the lab, where Taylor returns from outside with news: he found the researcher's boots ... with feet still in them. Gross. Elisabeth then calls Jim, who explains that he is not looking forward to playing host to Reynolds, who is courting Maddy. He then explains that Zoe has a cold. After hanging up, Elisabeth muses: ""Zoe ... who is Zoe?"" Uh oh. The pathogens are loose.

Later, Reynolds shows up to eat dinner and ""study"" with Maddy. He leaves and Maddy worries that it was the ""worst first date ever."" Jim explains that the worst first date was with his eventual wife, but that it turned out to be well worth it. Maddy smiles. The next morning, Jim visits Washington, who explains that the outlying lab has been quarantined on Taylor's orders. Jim heads to Malcolm, requesting to borrow the good doctor's rover. Malcolm agrees under one condition: he comes, too. Jim then sneezes as he has caught the cold from Zoe. Malcolm gives him some prehistoric medicine to chew on.

CUT to Josh, who gets even MORE cozy with Skye -- eventually leaning in and kissing her. But Josh pulls away, explaining that he made a promise to bring his future girlfriend to Terra Nova. ""What if I told you that I might know a guy who could help you with that,"" Skye whispers. Later that evening, Jim and Malcolm arrive at the outpost lab. Luckily, they wear breathing masks so as to avoid the pathogens. What they can't avoid, however, is Elisabeth carrying a HUGE gun. She shoots, sending a blast of energy that KNOCKS DOWN Jim. Elisabeth clearly doesn't recognize her husband ... but she does recognize Malcolm. Elisabeth gives the doctor a very familiar hug. Jim is horrified.

""She's at university,"" Malcolm explains later. ""She and I just started dating."" So the first stage of this airborne virus is short term memory loss followed by serious memory loss followed by ... catatonia. Malcolm explains that he can cure the virus with Elisabeth's help -- so long as she stays lucid. So Malcolm pretends that it is indeed 20 years ago (or 85 million and 20 years ago) when they were dating. CUT to Skye, who introduces Josh to a bartender named Tom. Turns out bringing someone from the future is expensive. ""You're the cop's son, right?"" Tom asks. ""Because trust is important around here.""

Back at the outpost, Jim shows Elisabeth a video of herself explaining the symptoms. Elisabeth finally accepts that she has been exposed to a pathogen -- and tells Jim and Malcolm, whose masks were knocked off, that they all must hurry. Suddenly, the power goes out. Allosaurs chewing on the power cables. Jim volunteers to check it out ... and runs across the unconscious body of a Terra Nova soldier. Is a sick Taylor responsible?

Sure enough, Taylor springs from a hole in the roof armed with a gun. ""Move a muscle and I'll blow your head off,"" he growls. Jim tries to explain to Taylor that he ISN'T at war in Somalia in 2138. ""The only question is who's running this mind game on me,"" Taylor growls. Meanwhile, Elisabeth and Malcolm discover that the lab was secretly running experiments on gene manipulation. Malcolm then suggests they ""skip class today"" and tries to kiss Elisabeth. Jim returns just in time to break them up. Malcolm snaps back to the present after his momentary slip. The pathogen is starting to take hold.

So why isn't Jim showing symptoms? No one is sure. Jim then explains that Taylor threatened his life before letting him go. Worse, Taylor is likely trying to find his way back to Terra Nova -- risking bringing the pathogen to the human populace. Just then, a long-necked dinosaurs slips into the lab from the open ceiling hatch. Jim rushes to close and lock a door between the dino and the humans. Malcolm starts to FREAK OUT at the sight of the creature -- which didn't exist when he was at university -- so Jim HITS him, knocking him out cold. So it's all up to Elisabeth. ""Do we know each other?"" she asks her husband. ""We're more than just acquaintances, aren't we?"" You could say that.

CUT to Taylor, who smears dirt on his face and then sneaks up on Terra Nova, KNOCKING OUT a patrolling guard ... and then spotting Washington. Her presence seems to confuse Taylor, who served with her in Somalia. Back at the lab, Elisabeth finds notes in her handwriting ... ""Josh,"" ""Maddy,"" ""Zoe"" and ""Jim."" Understanding dawns on Elisabeth's face. ""What happens if we both forget?"" she asks. Jim refuses to entertain the notion ... and then sneezes. Understanding dawns on Elisabeth's face again. The cold medicine that Malcolm gave Jim must be the key. Something in it is blocking the pathogen. CUT to Maddy, who has found out from Reynolds that her parents are locked away in a quarantined lab. The lovebirds go to see Washington, who urges them to leave. Too late. Taylor appears out of nowhere ...and holds a knife to Reynold's throat.

Washington tries to talk down Taylor, telling him that they won the war in Somalia. ""Seven years ago, you led us to this place so that we could have a second chance!"" she yells. ""This is home."" Taylor demands to see his wife. Washington explains that she died. Distraught, Taylor is about to cut his own throat when Washington BLASTS him with one of those force guns. He goes FLYING backward. CUT to the lab, where Elisabeth has a revelation. It's not the medicine that's blocking the pathogen but the cold itself. Jim then attempts to give Elisabeth his cold by KISSING her deeply.

The next day, Taylor wakes up at the hospital ... with a smiling Elisabeth and Washington watching over him. Turns out that Elisabeth made a vaccine for the pathogen. Malcolm is OK, too. Everybody is OK. But not everything is OK. CUT to bartender Tom, who ventures into the jungle to find the Sixers waiting. He gives them supplies he has taken from Terra Nova and tells Mira that he has struck a deal with the sheriff's son to bring back a girl from the future. Mira smiles. This could be a great opportunity to undermine law enforcement in Terra Nova. To be continued ..."

It's not a dino ... so it must be a Sixer. So Washington and her troops give chase and soon discover a tiny blonde girl. Back at the medical lab, a doctor tries to stick the girl with a needle and the little urchin strikes back. ""She's terrified,"" Elisabeth says. ""I need to get everybody out of here."" So everybody, including Taylor, leaves. Elisabeth successfully coaxes the girl out from underneath a table and gently examines her. The girl, an orphan, explains that she dropped her bag in the jungle while being chased. Taylor then reenters with food. The girl is ravenous. ""I only get scraps,"" she says. ""That's why I ran away.""

Taylor then identifies the girl as Leah. He used to know her family before they all defected to the Sixers side. Later, Taylor explains to Jim that he sees Leah as an opportunity to get intelligence on the Sixers. Elisabeth then volunteers to take in Leah. Jim is unsure and Josh is just plain unhappy as he will have to give up his room. But the Shannon family pulls together to warmly welcome its new, shy houseguest. CUT to the jungle, where Washington and another soldier hunt for Leah's bag. Suddenly, they are attacked by Sixers. A total badass, Washington singlehandedly takes out two or three Sixers before Mira appears and subdues her. ""Still doing Taylor's dirty work?"" Mira sneers. ""What did you do with her?"" We assume she is asking about Leah.

Meanwhile, Josh has been left in charge of watching Zoe and Leah while Maddy heads to the hospital to apprentice with her mother. Jim and Taylor walk through the market when the alarm begins to sound. Sixers -- lots of them -- are approaching the front gate. Mira pushes a restrained Washington to the front as trade bait. ""You have something that belongs to me,"" Mira says. ""I want her back."" Taylor says he will bring out Leah and let her decide ... if Mira releases Washington. Mira agrees and Leah is soon brought to the gate by Jim. ""Tell them you want to come home,"" Mira says. ""Speak!"" Leah flinches, explaining that she ran away and doesn't want to return to the Sixer camp. ""Keep her then,"" Mira practically spits. ""She's nothing to me."" Before Mira can leave, Taylor warns her not to threaten Terra Nova again. ""Next time I go to war,"" Taylor growls.

Taylor then makes nice with Leah, suggesting she might look at a map and identity the various Sixers campsites. So all appears well. Leah looks happy to be with such a loving family and a caring community. Later, Taylor and Jim go over a list of people who might have seen Leah and reported the news to the Sixers. In other words, they are looking for the mole inside Terra Nova. Taylor then heads out with Jim to interrogate a scientist named Rob arrived at Terra Nova with Mira, but didn't defect with her. Malcolm arrives after a few pointed questions to defend his associate. ""This is guilt by association,"" says a furious Malcolm, noting the conspicuous lack of lawyers in Terra Nova.

Later that day, Washington and Jim investigate a robbery inside Terra Nova. A piece of the floor has been removed, revealing a hidden safe. The current owners had no idea such a hideaway existed. And who used to live in the place? Mira, of course. ""We need to find Leah right now,"" Jim tells Washington. CUT to Leah, who is sneaking through Terra Nova on her way to the fence. Suddenly, Jim sneaks up behind her. ""What did you take from that couple's house?"" he gently asks. Turns out that Leah is almost certainly a spy sent by Mira, who then made quite a show pretending to want the little girl back. The item that Leah took from Mira's old house is a container of some kind. But what kind?

Leah claims not to know. ""Mira's got my brother and she said she would hurt him if I didn't steal back that box,"" the girl says. ""I'm telling the truth."" Understandably, Taylor and Jim are skeptical. Leah is then taken into custody. Taylor refuses to consider Jim's suggestion that they send a few men to check out Leah's story -- just in case. A little boy could be in danger, but Taylor refuses to risk men without more evidence. Back home, Jim finds a note from Leah that says, ""Sorry, I had to."" This convinces Jim that Leah's brother, Sam, really IS in danger. Looks the big guy is thinking about defying Taylor.

In the meantime, Reynolds very politely asks Maddy if he can court her. She is flattered and tells Reynolds all about her disastrous day at the hospital. Apparently, Maddy doesn't have the steel stomach of her mother when dealing with blood and wounds. CUT to Jim, who sneaks through the jungle looking for the Sixers. Within seconds, he is SNAGGED in a trap and soon finds himself hanging upside down a few yards off the ground. Naturally, a Slasher dino emerges and begins LEAPING at the hanging dad. Suddenly, the Slasher is hit with an energy blast. Sixers emerge from the tree line. Uh oh.

Sure enough, Jim awakens sometime later with a bump on his head. He is inside the Sixer camp and facing down Mira. ""The boy was never in danger,"" Mira explains. ""I just needed to motivate her."" Jim asks what is in the box that Leah attempted to steal. Mira only smiles. Jim then asks, more or less, why she is so generally unpleasant. ""Taylor has pissed off some very important people back in 2149,"" Mira says. ""They want him gone."" Mira goes on to explain that Terra Nova isn't about starting over as Taylor says -- not anymore. Exactly what Taylor's motivations might be, however, she refuses to detail. She also says that ""they"" will let her see her daughter again once her mission is complete. Jim asks, ""Who's 'they?'"" Again, Mira refuses to answer. Instead, she releases him.

Back at Terra Nova, the doors to Leah's cell suddenly open ... and Sam runs inside. The two siblings embrace. Jim watches them, smiling. Apparently, Mira allowed Jim to bring back the boy and reunite what is left of Leah's family. Later, Taylor admonishes Jim for defying orders -- but too hard. ""Did she say anything I should know about?"" Taylor asks in reference to Mira. Jim dances around the question. He clearly has newfound suspicions. We then find out that Maddy is no longer a hospital apprentice and a single woman in camp has expressed an interest in bringing Leah and Sam into her home.

At the end of the episode, Leah gives Sam a huge hug. ""Thank you,"" says the girl."

A young member of the security force opens the door to the tower and is ATTACKED by a dino. CUT the next day as Jim, Taylor, and Malcolm investigate the scene. The security member has died -- violently. Jim is suspicious. Yes, a dino killed the young man, but something doesn't sit right. Josh, in the meantime, cleans glasses at Tom's bar. Tom approaches, telling Josh that there has been a ""complication"" in bringing his girlfriend Kira from 2149. ""You want me to get her here, you're going to have to do something,"" Tom says. Tom then offers the young man a shot for courage.

Later, Jim approaches Taylor with his wild theory: the security member was murdered. How? Someone trapped a dino where he or she knew someone would come knocking. Essentially, the dinosaur was just the murder weapon. If true, it's the first murder in Terra Nova's brief history. Taylor assigns Washington to assist Jim in the investigation. They head to Tom's bar to do a little snooping. His unit members, including Reynolds, tell Jim and Washington that the dead man, Foster, often talked about seeing a mystery woman.

CUT to Zoe, who takes an interest in an Ankylosaurus egg that her mother and Malcolm are caring for. She is entranced by the idea of an unborn dino. Jim, in the meantime, checks the frequency on Foster's dog tag. It contains a tracking device. So Jim and Taylor follow the signal, chasing the dino that ate the tag when it killed Foster. A furious chase ensues as the Terra Nova force follows the sprinting dino into the jungle. Taylor takes a SHOT, hitting the creature. Washington cuts open the dino and removes Foster's electronic dog tag. Taylor activates it, revealing a hologram picture of Foster with a young, beautiful woman. Washington recognized the woman: Rebecca Milner.

So Jim and Washington pay a visit to Rebecca, who is married -- and not to Foster. Soon, Howard Milner returns home. He is older than his wife and seems quite nervous to see security personnel in his home. ""Did you think I didn't know?"" Howard asks his wife. ""Do you think I'm a fool?!"" Howard then confesses to killing Foster. ""If I had the chance, I'd kill him again,"" the betrayed husband practically spits. Under further questioning, Howard admits that he lured and trapped the dino in the communications tower, knowing that Foster would soon stop at the place during his patrol. Taylor now faces a decision. Should he banish the man to the jungle? Josh, meanwhile, explains to Skye that Tom wants him to meet with Mira outside the walls of Terra Nova. ""I don't have a choice,"" Josh says. ""You have no idea what 2149 is like ... I have to get her out of there.""

Later, Jim and Elisabeth get in a fight about what constitutes justice for Howard Milner. Jim suggests the man should be banished by Taylor. Elisabeth suggests that the man should have a proper trial. The next morning, however, Taylor announces to the camp that he is banishing Taylor -- a death sentence, to be sure. So Howard is escorted out of the front gates as everyone solemnly watches. A few sympathetic souls cry. Sometime later, Howard is walking along a creek bed when he hears a noise. It turns out to be Jim, who has tracked the confessed killer. Jim suggests that perhaps Rebecca is responsible for killing Foster. ""I know you're crazy for,"" Jim says. ""The question is are you crazy enough to fall on your sword for her?"" Howard appears to carefully to think it over.

CUT to Jim knocking on Rebecca's front door. She answers ... and is shocked to discover Howard. Jim has snuck the man back inside Terra Nova. Howard then explains that Foster broke it off with Rebecca some weeks prior. Rebecca defends herself, claiming that Foster ""turned out to be a jerk."" She was happy when the security member ended their relationship. So if neither Rebecca or Howard killed Foster, who did? Rebecca explains that Foster was heavily into gambling. Upon hearing the news, Taylor is furious. ""Banishing Milner, I put a huge chunk of my reputation on the line,"" Taylor says. ""Now you tell me that I got the wrong guy!?"" Taylor urges Jim to find the truth.

So Jim heads back to Tom's bar, where the illegal gambling is rumored to take place. He spots Josh, who explains that he works at the saloon. Jim is shocked, but has no time to deal with his son's sketchy part-time job at the moment. He takes Tom in for questioning. Turns out Jim has done some research and discovered that Tom keeps illicit financial records the old fashioned way -- on paper. So Jim returns to the bar to search for a ledger. While he is there, he explains to his son that his part-time job has ended. Josh, not surprisingly, is indignant. Just then, Reynolds runs into the bar. Tom has escaped!

So Jim, Taylor and a squad head out to find the escapee ... and then Taylor reveals that it is all a ruse. He turns toward one of his soldiers, Curran. ""The money you owe Foster -- you're account has been tapped,"" Taylor says. ""How much did you owe him, son?"" Curran then pulls his gun and attempts to shoot Taylor, but his gun is empty. ""You didn't think I gave you a live one?"" Taylor sneers before disarming the young man and throws him against a tree. Taylor then opens Curran's vest and discovers the ledger. The soldier sold it so his debts to Foster wouldn't be revealed. Curran demands to be taken back to Terra Nova for a court martial. ""You just had one,"" Taylor says. He points a gun at Curran. ""Start walking,"" Taylor says. So Curran does, walking into the deadly jungle.

Later, Jim returns home to discover Josh playing his guitar. ""What are you still doing here?"" Jim asks. ""Aren't you late for work?"" Turns out Jim had decided that Josh is old enough to make his own decisions. ""In this family, no secrets,"" Jim tells his on. Of course, Josh DOES have secrets. CUT to Josh and Skye, who meet Tom. Tom hands the teens a gun and tells them where they can meet Mira. After walking deep in the jungle, the young teens soon find themselves surrounded by Sixers. Mira has a deal for Josh: she will help bring back Kira, but Josh owes her a favor that he must perform without question at some point in the future. Josh agrees to the deal.

Back at Terra Nova, the Ankylosaur egg is hatching. ""You did it, mommy!"" Zoe says. ""Can we keep it?"" Jim frowns. Elisabeth smiles."

Maddy is dressed up and claims to be planning to spend the day doing homework. Of course, the moment her parents and siblings leave, she meets Reynolds for an afternoon of flirting. Taylor and Malcolm, meanwhile, examine as mysterious object that has a kind of DNA password protection on it. Malcolm theorizes that only Mira can open it. That information makes Taylor grimace.

CUT to the hospital, where Elisabeth lectures dumb teen Hunter for drinking some kind of unfermented historical beverage. One body scan later, Elisabeth discovers that Hunter has a disgusting parasite growing inside him. Jim, in the meantime, takes Zoe to an underground station to get a close up view of ""The Eye,"" a virtual library stored in a liquid memory core. Zoe is astounded. She chooses to explore where she was born -- 2133 in Illinois. ""That's where we had to go because we weren't allowed to have you,"" Jim explains. Zoe then asks to look at a rollercoaster. It's a bonding moment.

Later, Reynolds takes Maddy to a prehistoric field to see flowers. She is impressed and the two are soon laughing and picnicking. ""You're perfect,"" Reynolds says. The two are about to kiss when Reynolds spots a streaking meteor that crashes into the ground, sending up a huge cloud of dirt ... and a sonic wave. Suddenly, all the power goes out in Terra Nova and citizens run cover. The wave hits the settlement, leaving a path of destruction. A few hours later, Taylor addresses his troops, explaining the wave fried all the electric circuits in Terra Nova. The colony is more or less defenseless. That's bad for Hunter, who is in real pain. Elisabeth is going to have to operate the ""old fashioned way.""

Also in a pickle are Jim and Zoe, who are trapped inside the underground station. Jim's communications device is knocked out as are the controls to the steel door. Reynolds and Maddy are also stranded in the woods as their vehicle and weapons no longer works. ""We're six clicks out, we can make it before dark,"" Taylor says. The two begin to hike. Malcolm, in the meantime, explains to Taylor that he can make new chips, but he needs somebody to fix the chip inside the chip maker. And the only man who can do that is apparently bartender Tom. Taylor reluctantly asks Tom for help -- and strong arms him when the smart-mouthed bartender asks for a statue to be erected in his honor.

Elisabeth, meanwhile, opens up Hunter with a scalpel and begins to pull the wormlike parasite out of his abdomen. It's disgusting. CUT to the Sixer camp, where Mira hears news of the colony's woes. ""We're going in,"" she says. Later, Reynolds and Maddy realize that they're not going to make it back to Terra Nova before dark. So, they smear each other with smelly mud to mask themselves from predators. They seem to enjoy it. It's not so enjoyable when night falls and the pair is attacked by dino predators. Maddy and Reynolds quickly climb a tree. ""I think we should stay here until the sun comes up,"" Reynolds says. Maddy agrees. Jim, meanwhile, finds a hatch in the bottom of the floor. Unfortunately, he is too large to climb through the passageway and pull the manual override on the front door. A very scared Zoe will have to do it.

CUT to the Sixers, who are using fire to herd an enormous dinosaur toward Terra Nova. ""Ram it down Taylor's throat!"" Mira yells. Back at the hospital, Skye is drafted into service to pull out the parasite while Elisabeth works on other patients.""It kills me that you're in love with Josh,"" Hunter tells his new attendant. ""I always thought, one day, me and you might ..."" Just then, the parasite slips out of Skye's grasp and slithers back into Hunter's body. He begins to convulse. Uh oh. Hunter and Maddy, in the meantime, are making out in the tree. ""Now we can die,"" she jokes. CUT to Zoe, who crawls through the hatch and unlocks the door for her dad. Jim puts Zoe into the care of another adult and goes off to look for Taylor. Just then, the big dino BURSTS through the tree line.

Taylor and Jim fire flaming arrows over the fence ... and ignite a perimeter of gas that has been laid around the outside of Terra Nova. Taylor then realizes that the dino's body is poked full of arrows. ""It's a diversion,"" he notes. ""They're probably already inside."" Tom, in the meanwhile, has made a new chip -- and hands it over to Skye who takes it back to the hospital. So at least Elisabeth's patients, including Hunter, will be saved. Jom and Taylor, meanwhile, run into the Sixers inside a lab -- and get into a furious fistfight. Both of the Terra Nova manly men do some serious butt kicking, throwing Sixers through glass windows and walls. Still, a lucky Sixer manages to steal Mira's box.

It looks as if Taylor is going to be defeated by a particularly large Sixer when Tom enters with an old-fashioned gun. When the Sixer charges Tom, Tom SHOOTS him dead. ""I only had one bullet,"" the bartender confesses. Outside, Jim chases the Sixer who stole Mira's mystery box.he makes it outside the fence and hands the box to Mira, who promptly disappears into the jungle. Back at the hospital, Elisabeth uses the chip to turn on the body scanner to locate and kill the parasite. Hunter is saved.

The next day, all is seemingly back to normal in Terra Nova. Taylor, meanwhile, is upset that Mira knew exactly where to send her goons to find the box. ""We have to hunt down this spy,"" Taylor tells Jim. ""This is unacceptable."" CUT to Mira, who ventures deep into the woods when a haggard young man appears into a clearing. ""Give it to me,"" he says. ""Thank you for finally getting your act together and doing what you were sent here to do."" Mira wants to know what the box is for. ""My work,"" says the young man, whose DNA immediately opens the box. A series of digital designs emerge from the box. ""Beautiful, aren't they?"" the man asks. ""So much to do."" Mira then calls the man Lucas and warns that Taylor knows something is up. ""Dad will have to choose between his flesh and blood and his precious Terra Nova,"" Lucas growls. So Lucas is Taylor's lost son."

Back home, Elisabeth tells Maddy that famous geologist Ken Horton is back from a six-month field study. Maddy is star struck. Josh rolls his eyes. Later, Josh works at Tom's bar. ""Mira's calling in her favor,"" says the bartender, explaining that the Sixers need medicine -- medicine that is under lock and key. ""Mira's asking me to rob my mother?"" Josh asks. She is indeed. Just how badly does Josh want to bring his GF to Terra Nova?

Elisabeth, meanwhile, introduces Maddy to Ken, who invites the teenager to his lab. She gushes over his latest book and fishes for an internship. Ken accepts. He also doesn't seem to remember much of anything that he has written in the past -- whether it be in books or letters. Strange. Later, Skye tries to convince Josh not to steal supplies from the camp. ""It's not like I'm giving them guns,"" he says. ""They're sick. They need medicine."" Angry and exasperated, Skye storms off. Back home, Maddy explains to Elisabeth that Ken isn't quite as impressive as his reputation. ""He had a stroke,"" Elisabeth says. ""He's not the man he was."" Maddy becomes even more suspicious when she notices that a recent autograph on one of Ken's books doesn't match an older letter. Hmm.

CUT to Josh, who sneaks out of Terra Nova and into the Sixers camp. He wants assurances that Mira can indeed deliver his GF from the future. So Mira pushes a button on a futuristic device and a flickering hologram of Kara appears. The two briefly talk. Josh is convinced. Jim and Taylor, meanwhile, discover the remnants of a camp. Taylor orders Jim back to Terra Nova, explaining that he will stay out another day. What is Taylor searching for? Sixers? His son? Curran? CUT to Josh, who steals his mother's ID card and then goes to the bar where Tom scans and copies the card. Then it's on to the lab, but mom's card no longer works after being scanned. So Josh uses a powerful stun gun loaned to him by Tom to SHOOT the door. The kickback in such small quarters sends Tom HURTLING against the wall. Limping in pain, he grabs the drugs.

Now alone, Taylor follows the mysterious trail and comes upon Curran, the soldier that he kicked out of Terra Nova for killing a fellow officer. He literally kicks the disgraced soldier while he is down and injured. The next morning, Maddy asks Ken to please return his response to the fan letter she wrote years ago. Ken, however, claims to have lost it. What is the scientist hiding? To find out, Maddy later breaks into Ken's home, finds the letter and pockets it. CUT to Taylor, who gives Curran medicine for his injured leg. Curran wonders why Taylor is helping him. Taylor chooses not to respond.

Back home, Maddy gives Zoe her latest theory: Ken isn't really Ken. Instead, the man known as Ken stole the real Ken's identity, then had surgery so he would physically resemble the real Ken. But how can she prove it? She hits on an idea: the letter would have the real Ken's DNA where he licked the envelope. So she has to get a sample of the fake Ken's DNA to do a comparison. After deftly stealing Ken's coffee cup, Maddy goes to the lab to perform the test. Malcolm, who never liked Ken, agrees to help. Unfortunately, the test shows a DNA match. Maddy was apparently wrong. Unbeknownst to Maddy and Malcolm, Ken is listening in on their conversation from behind a wall.

Josh then meets with Tom, who hatches a plan to take the heat off the young boy. He strikes a deal with a drunk named Willie. If Willie takes the fall, Tom will forgive the man's considerable debts. So Willie stumbles into the hospital high on the drugs stolen by Josh. Elisabeth immediately calls Jim, who agrees to search Willie's place. That evening, Taylor squares off against the lizard creature that injured Curran. He repels the beast basically by standing his ground, shouting and waving a flaming stick. So Curran remains safe. Why all the effort from Taylor? He explains that he might just let Curran return to Terra Nova if Curran goes undercover at the Sixer camp. ""You're going to find out for me who inside Terra Nova is supplying information to Mira,"" Taylor says.

Maddy, meanwhile, does some more digging at the hologram library and discovers that Ken's longtime assistant disappeared under mysterious circumstances shortly before Ken came to Terra Nova. Maddy does a bit more research and discovers that a man's body was found in Ken's neighborhood -- unidentifiable and badly mutilated. What if the assistant was the one who actually mailed the letter (thus, the DNA match), but still killed the famous doctor and then stole his identity/face. Once again, Ken is lurking nearby and this time confronts the teenager, who manages to escape and flee the library.

Later, Maddy goes to school to pick up Zoe, but the teacher explains that fake Ken was there earlier to pick up the little girl. Maddy is horrified and races to the orchard, where she finds fake Ken holding Zoe. He agrees to let Zoe free if Maddy sticks around to ""talk."" Maddy tells Zoe to run home and tell Jim that she will be home in time to cook the asparagus. This must be some kind of code. Later, fake Ken pulls out a deadly spider that he plans to use to kill the young woman. Jim appears out of nowhere and PUNCHES fake Ken in the face. Maddy is saved. Back home, he and Elisabeth talk about how asparagus is a family ""panic word."" He has also discovered that Willie didn't steal the drugs. Willie, under questioning, reveals that Tom put him up to it.

Josh walks into the kitchen and returns a vial of the stolen drugs. Jim's and Elisabeth's jaws drop. ""You stole from your mother?"" Jim asks. Josh then explains that he gave the medicine to the Sixers in exchange for bringing Kara to Terra Nova ... and that Tom arranged everything. Jim rushes out of the house to arrest Tom, who insists that he is telling the truth about the Sixers. ""I don't know how she does it, but Mira can talk to the future,"" Tom gasps. Jim then tells Taylor, who doesn't know how this is possible ... or maybe he does. ""Lucas,"" Taylor sighs. ""The kid's a genius."" In fact, Lucas was recruited to develop such a technology. As for why Lucas left, well, Taylor isn't saying."

""What do you got for me today?"" she asks. Is the fly the spy? Taylor, meanwhile, interrogates Tom, who admits to having traded with the Sixers. He did NOT, however, give them inside information. Taylor believes Tom is withholding -- so he turns on a blaring siren inside the prison cell and slams shut the door. Torture.

The Shannon family, in the meantime, gets ready for the ""Harvest Festival,"" where a play celebrating Taylor's arrival is apparently staged each year. And, for some reason, Zoe is portraying Taylor in the play. Josh then pulls aside Jim, asking his dad to check in on Tom. ""I'll see what I can do,"" dad promises. Later, Jim visits Taylor inside Tom's cell. Tom isn't looking good. He is barely conscious. ""He did shoot a Sixer and save your life,"" Jim says. ""You really think he's a Sixer?"" Taylor doesn't seem to care. After Taylor leaves, a drugged Tom begins babbling about something being buried by ""Pilgrim's Tree"" -- something that would destroy Taylor. Jim is intrigued.

Jim then heads to Malcolm, who explains that Taylor lived in what became known as ""Pilgrim's Tree"" when the commander first arrived at Terra Nova. Malcolm even gives Jim coordinates. So Jim head to the tree -- alone -- and starts digging. He finds a skeleton. Later, Elisabeth examines the body and deems it a middle-aged male who has been dead for four to six years. The man is missing his right arm. Did Taylor do it? ""I think Taylor would do anything if he thought it was in the best interests of the colony,"" Jim says.

CUT to Reynolds on patrol in the jungle. Suddenly, a tree falls in the road -- and Sixers ATTACK. A furious battle ensues in which the Sixers quickly get the upper hand. They steal all the medicine and food from the convoy. Back at Terra Nova, Maddy directs the school play when the giant dragonfly suddenly appears. One of the soldiers BATS the bug with his weapon -- and Maddy notices that it is equipped with a microchip. Later, Malcolm explains to Taylor that they have found the spy's delivery device -- an insect. ""They must have found out how to lure it back and forth between locations,"" Malcolm explains. Washington then enters with bad news: the convoy has been hit. Washington explains that she put together the convoy AFTER Tom arrested. The bartender couldn't possibly be the Sixer spy. A grumpy Taylor tells Washington to let the prisoner go.

Back at the hospital, Elisabeth discovers that the dead body found at Pilgrim's Tree didn't come through time on an ""official"" pilgrimage. Instead, the victim arrived between the second and third pilgrimages. Jim then visits Tom, who says he helped Taylor bury the body -- but doesn't know what happened to the man or who he might have been. Tom explains that Taylor blamed Lucas for the mystery man's death after summoning him through time. ""That was the last night anyone saw Lucas Taylor,"" Tom finishes. CUT to the hospital, where Malcolm discovers the mystery skeleton. ""I don't like having secrets in my own lab,"" Malcolm tells Elisabeth. Malcolm then announces he is getting Taylor.

Moments later, Malcolm, Taylor, Elisabeth and Jim are gathered around the skeleton. Jim lies, saying he was alerted to location of the grave by an anonymous note left at his door. Taylor, also lying, declares that the body must be an errant Sixer. Now Jim is REALLY nervous. The next day, Malcolm discovers that the dragonfly is being summoned and sent via a sub-sonic signature. He suggests to Taylor that they release the insect -- whose wing has been surgically repaired -- and follow it right to the spy sending out the signal.

Festival time. Malcolm releases the bug and follows it on a handheld monitor while Terra Nova's children put on their play to honor Taylor. Proud parents Jim and Elisabeth watch as Zoe plays Taylor ... and shares dialogue a young boy who plays a general who is missing his right arm. Jim and Elisabeth put two and two together. Jim theorizes that the general came back to Terra Nova to relieve Taylor of his command. Just then, Taylor appears -- and announces that he is putting Jim under arrest. Why? The dragonfly went right to the Shannon house. ""You're the spy, Shannon!"" Taylor barks.

So now it's Jim's turn in the interrogation cell. It soon becomes clear that Taylor doesn't really believe that Jim is the spy. Rather, Taylor just wants the cop to drop his investigation into the dead body. Jim refuses the deal, vowing to uncover the truth. ""Why'd you kill General Philbrick!?"" Jim demands. Taylor angrily explains that he did kill the general. Why? Because the same people who sent the general to relieve Taylor also sent the Sixers. And these people -- these ""vile people"" -- just want to plunder Terra Nova like they did the Earth. It was never a new beginning, but the same old story.

Taylor wants to defend Terra Nova and so these future folks want him dead. And the exposition doesn't stop there. Taylor explains that Lucas was working on a way to open a convenient pathway between past and future. ""He was on their side from the get go -- he was working to make the portal go both ways,"" the commander says. When Taylor found out, he destroyed all his son's work. Days later, Lucas went AWOL. Taylor followed his boy and watched in amazement as the general suddenly appeared from the future in a ball of electricity. Taylor shot the general ... but couldn't pull the trigger on Lucas. ""You're a traitor,"" Taylor told his son. ""There's no place for you in Terra Nova. I never want to see your face again."" That was the last time Taylor saw his boy -- five years ago. But Taylor does see Lucas's calculations on rocks left behind to taunt dear ol' dad.

Taylor then releases Jim -- and apologizes for ""playing rough."" Explains Taylor: ""My own son is out there formulating an equation that will allow his friends on the other side to have their way with our home. Would you bow? Would you let those people do to Terra Nova what they did to the Earth they left behind? Or would you fight?"" Jim answers: ""I would fight. I will fight."" Outside, the festival continues unabated. Taylor then admits to tuning the power charge on Jim's gun to attract the dragonfly. Later, Taylor addresses the assembled population, telling the crowd that ""we're all in this together ... You're my friends, my family, my loved ones."" Fireworks explode in the sky.

CUT to the jungle, where Lucas sits at a campfire. He watches the fireworks from afar."

""Your parents would be really proud of who you've become,"" says Taylor, who notes that a certain prehistoric fever has killed more Terra Novians than anything else. He isn't sure if they'll ever find a cure. Taylor then gears up to head outside of Terra Nova on a double-secret mission.. Because Washington is away on assignment, Jim will be left in charge of Terra Nova's forces.

Later, Taylor investigates the strange hieroglyphics that have been drawn on the rocks near the river. Has Lucas come closer to a time-traveling answer? Suddenly, Mira approaches. She levels a gun at Taylor. Back at Terra Nova, Zoe watches the progress of her own pet dino, which is currently a small-sized lizard. Unfortunately, the dino is getting too big and will need to let back into the wild sometime very soon.

Dad, in the meantime, is securing the perimeter of the colony and making sure that no one uses a radio frequency that the Sixer spy might piggyback on. Just then, a soldier spots an active radio frequency coming from outside Terra Nova. Jim and Reynolds use binoculars to scan the compound and see which citizen is talking on a device. Reynolds spots a flashing light by an under-construction house. Jim and Reynolds rush to the construction site and find a single drop of blood in a jar of paint sealant. Unbeknownst to either, Skye is hiding nearby. She has cut her hand with a piece of mirror. Is Skye the Sixer spy?

CUT to the jungle, where Taylor makes a run for it. Mira FIRES her pulse rifle, sending Taylor flying. He manages to hide a small blade in his hand before Mira reaches him. Taylor plans to cut himself free. Back at Terra Nova, Josh approaches Skye and sincerely apologizes for getting her involved with the Sixers. She hides her bleeding hand and gets out of the conversation as quickly as possible. Skye then heads to the medical tent. She steals a spray that almost instantly seals her wound. CUT to Jim, who tries to extract the blood drop ... but it spreads and dissipates as soon as he touches it. ""Damn,"" he sighs.

So Jim brings the jar of sealant to Elisabeth in an attempt to salvage the evidence. ""I'm a doctor, not a chemist,"" she says. ""You're going to have to talk to Malcolm. Sorry."" So is Jim. CUT to Taylor, who is still being led through the jungle by Mira. Taylor begins to taunt Mira for working for men who plan to pillage the prehistoric world. She refuses to apologize, explaining that she took the deal to save her sick daughter. Just then, something SNARLS nearby. The noise distracts Mira and gives Taylor, who has used the blade to free himself, the opening he needs to disarm the Sixer. Now Mira is the prisoner.

""When did you last see him?"" Taylor asks. ""Lucas?"" Mira says Lucas comes and goes as he pleases. She also says that Lucas told her that he hates his dad because of what happened in Somalia. ""So what happened in Somalia?"" Mira asks. Taylor becomes FURIOUS and SLAMS the Sixer up against a tree. Suddenly, both once again hear the SNARL. Something is tracking the pair. Back at the hospital, Jim convinces Malcolm to work on the blood sample before spotting Zoe trying to sneak her pet dino outside. Zoe is very sad that she has to say goodbye to her not-so-domesticated buddy.

CUT to Skye, who has volunteered to join Josh on a work crew outside of Terra Nova. At the first opportunity, she slips away into the jungle ... joining a gang of Sixers hiding out nearby. So she IS the spy. Later, Skye arrives at the Sixer camp and hands over a data disc of intel. ""Now let me see her,"" Skye demands. In the corner is a sick, middle-aged woman. It's Skye's mother. ""Remember we're the only ones with a cure,"" says a Sixer who is holding a small bag of meds. So Skye's motivation has become clear.

Back at Terra Nova, Malcolm has extracted a tiny amount of blood, which is then tested by Elisabeth. The DNA identification will be ready by the next morning. CUT to Taylor and Mira, who are resting when they hear a pair of SNARLS. Suddenly, two huge dinos -- ""slashers"" -- ATTACK. Taylor and Mira make a run for it -- and soon find themselves standing at the top of a huge waterfall. Taylor cuts Mira free and the two LEAP. They fall hundreds of feet into the water below. Taylor loses his gun in the process. He then hands Mira a knife. ""We can fight each other, or we can fight them,"" he says. Mira nods.

CUT to Terra Nova, where Skye has returned to camp. She sneaks into the hospital, spots her DNA sample being scanned and then sabotages the test with a drop of acid. Later, Reynolds awkwardly declares his ""intentions"" to one day marry Jim's 16-year-old daughter. Jim turns the conversation back to the spy and discovers that the DNA sample has been destroyed. ""I need you to put together a list of all medical center employees and their families,"" Jim tells Elisabeth. Back in the jungle, Taylor and Mira have made camp. They argue over the best way to make flaming spears when a familiar SNARL returns. The slashers attack. Taylor NAILS one with a flaming spear, sending it fleeing.

Later, the pair eat jungle grubs and appear to almost bond following their near-death experiences together. ""Could've been different -- you and I,"" Taylor says. ""We could've made a helluva team."" What might have been. What probably never will. Back at Terra Nova, Elisabeth reveals that just enough of the DNA test was completed to reveal that the spy is a woman. So her list of 84 names can be immediately cut down to 47. It's a start.

The next morning, Taylor and Mira prepare to part ways. ""Your son is close to figuring out how to reverse the portal,"" she says. In other words, Taylor can't stop the bad guys from the future coming to rob Terra Nova of its innocence. Retorts Taylor: ""The question is: how does it end?"" Indeed. Later, a very sad Zoe releases her pet dino into the wild. As if on cue, a much larger (mother) dino of the same species emerges to greet the baby.

Skye, in the meantime, comes to visit Taylor. The pair agree to take a walk to Memorial Field to visit the grave of her dead parents. Skye appears nervous. ""Something on your mind?"" asks a friendly Taylor. Skye deflects, claiming nothing is wrong."

Taylor urges Jim to identify the Sixer spy before the new settlers arrive. Jim explains that he is whittling down his list of suspected females. Later, Jim interviews Skye -- as a formality in his mind. Where was Skye when the Sixer spy was detected sending a message from Terra Nova? ""I was with Josh,"" she says. ""I was trying to teach him how to play Chess."" Jim smiles and lets the (still unidentified) Sixer spy go free.

Back home, Maddy fiddles with her futuristic tablet -- and it loses power. Turns out the power core is dead. ""Mine blew last week,"" Josh says. They'll have to wait for the 11th pilgrimage for more cores to arrive as there is a ""colony shortage,"" according to Elisabeth. Josh leaves for work and he is intercepted by Skye. She asks Josh to lie to Jim and say that he was playing Chess with her. Josh agrees, thinking it an inconsequential white lie. Later that night, Skye sneaks out of Terra Nova and arrives at the Sixer camp. She goes to see her mother, who is obviously very sick. Lucas sits nearby in the shadows.

""I want us to be friends,"" Lucas says when he is alone with Skye. ""Your mother has no idea you're a spy, does she?"" Skye demands to know what Lucas wants. And Lucas wants Skye to do him a favor: take a microchip containing the final piece of the puzzle to make the time portal ""go both ways."" Skye will have to take the chip and activate it at The Eye. And if she refuses? Lucas matter-of-factly says that he will kill her mother. The next day, Skye sneaks into The Eye and activates the chip using her futuristic tablet. Some hours after that, she returns to the Sixer camp. Lucas takes the chip back and examines its content via hologram. ""It's going to work,"" he says. ""I'm so close."" Asks Skye: ""And after the portal opens both ways? What then?"" Says Lucas: ""You'll see.""

Back at camp, Washington and Jim watch a video feed that has captured Skye sneaking out of Terra Nova through a brush-covered drainage ditch. Jim immediately heads home to confront Josh, who earlier lied and backed up Skye's Chess story. ""You weren't with Skye last Thursday, were you?"" Jim asks. Josh confirms as much, claiming that he didn't think it was that big of a deal. ""Josh, you're my son and I love you very much, but don't lie to me again,"" Jim says. ""You're grounded."" Josh protests -- to no avail. Jim then shares the news with Taylor, who is heartbroken to hear that Skye is the spy. Taylor says that he will confirm with his man in the Sixer camp: banished soldier Kern.

Later, Taylor plays Chess with Taylor, who casually gives an order to Reynolds concerning a convoy. Moments later, Taylor and Jim watch live video of Skye sneaking out of Terra Nova. ""She took the bait,"" Jim says. Barks Taylor: ""One way or another, this is going to end."" So Taylor leads the phony-but-real convoy through the jungle as Jim watches with binoculars from a nearby ridge with a team of armed soldiers. Soon, the trees begin to shake. Is it the Sixers? Nope. It's a pack of brontosauruses. Why didn't the Sixers attack? ""Maybe Skye didn't tell Mira,"" suggests Jim, noting that the Sixers were never made aware of dozens of convoys as well as the location of weapons caches. Jim then suggests that Skye is a spy only because ""they are holding something over on her.""

CUT to Sixerville, where Mira confronts Skye. ""Your intel has been garbage lately,"" Mira says. ""Do better."" And if Skye doesn't? You guessed it: mom dies. Skye then runs into Lucas, who is completely crazed. ""Don't go back to Terra Nova,"" Lucas says. ""It's not safe for you there. They're coming."" Lucas then explains that his ""employers"" will soon arrive through the portal thanks to the contents of the microchip. Lucas will finally be able to defeat his father. ""And I have you to thank,"" Lucas coos. Skye is disgusted.

She goes to her mother and, through tears, confesses that she is a spy. ""You're not doing this anymore,"" mom says. ""You're going to run back to Terra Nova, you're going to go straight to Taylor and tell them everything you know."" But what about mom? She says that she has been sick a very long time and is prepared to die. Skye weeps. Later, Jim and Taylor wait for Skye, who comes running back to Terra Nova. ""Give me one reason why I shouldn't lock you away for the rest of your life,"" growls Taylor. Skye explains that her mother is alive -- and the Sixers have her. ""I'm done lying,"" cries Skye, before explaining that Lucas has completed his calculations and is on the way to the portal now.

CUT to the portal, where Taylor's soldiers wait. Suddenly, the portal ROARS to life. Lucas appears and the portal sends out a BLAST of energy, knocking down -- and knocking out -- the soldiers. Moments later, Taylor and Jim arrive at the portal to find Lucas standing next to it. Lucas begins to taunt his father. ""Listen to me, there are good people here -- innocent people,"" Taylor says. ""Think what will happen to them."" Lucas isn't listening. ""Open your eyes, old man!"" Lucas screams. ""It's over ... Next time we meet, you'll be on your knees, begging me for mercy. I won't be alone."" Lucas then steps through the portal. There is a BLAST of light and then Lucas is gone -- to the future.

Back at Terra Nova, Skye cries as he explains to Josh that his mother will now likely die. She is then called to the infirmary, where her mother awaits. ""You have this man to thank,"" says Jim, introducing a ragged-looking Kern. Taylor sent orders for Kern to retrieve Skye's mother ... but he still hasn't forgiven Skye for spying. Not yet. Later, Taylor tells Jim that Lucas's mother died because Taylor couldn't save her. Lucas has never forgiven his father. But there's no time for regrets now. Lucas will surely bring back a team of deadly soldiers from the future. Terra Nova will have to get ready."

""We'll get in,"" Lucas says. ""We have the best army money can buy."" CUT to hordes of armed and uniformed men marching in unison. Uh oh.

Meanwhile, in the past, Taylor readies his men for battle. One advantage: the soldiers know that Lucas and his army will arrive through the portal. Later, Josh asks his dad if he too can fight. ""It's too dangerous,"" Jim says. ""I need you here looking after your sisters."" Do Jim and Elisabeth, who will tend to the wounded, head to the front. Soon enough, the portal begins to flicker and glow. Something is coming through. Out steps a regular-looking man with a backpack ... followed by a woman and their child. More people from the 11th pilgrimage come through. One of them is Josh's girlfriend. Jim takes her aside.

Then a man comes through and opens his coat to reveal a bomb. He EXPLODES. Later, a wounded Jim awakens in the infirmary. His ears ring loudly. Jim wanders outside to find that Terra Nova has been all but destroyed. Enemy soldiers patrol the camp. Mira and Lucas, meanwhile, have taken Taylor's place at camp headquarters. Elisabeth appears and pulls Taylor away from the guards. She explains that he has been asleep for three days. The kids are safe, but 26 others were killed when the enemy stormed the camp. Taylor, meanwhile, is missing. Jim returns home to find Josh crying. His girlfriend, Kara, died in the blast. Josh blames himself and then hugs his dad.

Jim then heads to Tom's bar, where enemy soldiers drink and carouse. Washington sits at a table by herself. She explains that the soldiers make up a private army called the Phoenix Group. Washington laments not being able to defend the camp. ""They came here to strip mine the place, but how are they going to ship anything back to 2149 when they blew up the terminus?' Jim asks. Washington explains that the Phoenix Group has a special transport device that was broken with a run-in with a Carno. Malcolm is fixing it. So Jim heads to the infirmary and finds that Malcolm is reluctantly cooperating. The good doctor agrees to fix the device as slowly as possible so as to buy Jim time.

Mira and Lucas, meanwhile, arrive at the infirmary to interrogate Jim, who pretends to be deaf and disoriented from the blast. Malcolm sells the ruse and Jim is soon dismissed. Later, Skye is brought before Lucas, who begins to creepily flirt with the teen. ""Don't betray me again,"" he finally warns. ""Next time I won't be so forgiving."" Elisabeth then summons Jim to the infirmary. She has removed many bullets from Phoenix Group soldiers and discovered numbers hand-etched on the slugs. Jim grins, explaining that they are map coordinates. Taylor etched the numbers to identify a rendezvous point.

Later, Malcolm creates a diversion, arguing with a Phoenix soldier so that Jim can slip undetected into the back of a truck leaving Terra Nova in a caravan. When the caravan stops, Jim ducks out into the nearby jungle. He overhears as Lucas and the men discuss how they plan to firebomb the jungle to remove any wildlife. For fun, Weaver grabs a gun and kills a harmless brontosaurus. Jim then heads to the rendezvous point and finds Reynolds and Taylor waiting with a small group of soldiers. One of the soldiers, Riley, volunteers to trace the blast signal and defuse the bomb. Weaver, looking through binoculars from a faraway ridge, spots the rebels. Just as Weaver is about to detonate the bomb, Riley manages to disarm it. Lucas is FURIOUS. Score one for the elder Taylor.

Jim then returns to camp, hiding a transmitter given to him by Taylor. ""That was too close,"" he grimly tells his family. The next day, Taylor attaches the transmitter to Lucas's rover. Cue a MONTAGE of Taylor intercepting various patrol caravans, taking out men with booby traps and ambushes. ""Someone's helping my father,"" Lucas seethes. CUT to the bar, where Josh angrily serves a drink to Lucas. He is shocked when Skye is escorted to Lucas's table. Lucas begins stroking Skye's face. ""Stop it,"" cries Skye. Josh then cracks a metal tray over Lucas's head. Skye flees the bar and runs to Jim.

Jim enters the bar to find that his son has been severely beaten by the guards. ""I'm going to have to make an example of you,"" Lucas tells a bleeding Josh. Suddenly, Jim leaps at Lucas, BASHING him in the head with a metal bar. A furious bar fight ensues as Jim takes on multiple Phoenix soldiers. It all ends when the thugs draw their weapons. Jim is then forced to empty his pockets, revealing the transmitter. Lucas DEMANDS to know where to find Taylor. Jim doesn't answer, so Lucas has Jim and Josh taken to the brig.

Later, Lucas arrives to continue the interrogation. He releases Josh at Skye's request -- and then threatens Jim with torture until he reveals Taylor's location. Meanwhile, Elisabeth treats Weaver for bug bite -- and then reveals that she has injected the man from the future with a deadly parasite. ""Lucas Taylor is detaining my husband and you are going to help me get him out in exchange for the cure,"" Elisabeth explains. ""Do we have a deal?"" We do. And it couldn't come at a better time because Lucas is busy SHOCKING Jim with a cattle prod. The torture is only interrupted when Lucas stops to tell the story of how Taylor was fighting in Somalia when rebels captured Lucas and his mother. Taylor was forced to only choose one person to save--either Lucas or his mother. Taylor chose Lucas and Lucas watched as his mother was murdered. Obviously, the boy has never forgiven his old man.

Just then, Weaver enters, telling Lucas that he is needed elsewhere. Weaver then sneaks Jim into the infirmary and demands the cure from Elisabeth, who admits she was bluffing. She quickly injects Weaver with a sedative. The brontosaurus killer keels over and the Shannon family makes a run for it. They are joined by Washington, who has swiped from a drunken guard a device that will turn off a section of the fence. She volunteers to distract the guards so the family can make it all the way to the tree line. ""There's no other way,"" she says. ""Save your family."" Washington then leaves, setting off an explosion before being corralled by Phoenix soldiers. She is brought before Lucas."

He lowers the binoculars in shame and sadness. The Shannons, meanwhile, scramble into Taylor's waiting rover. Thanks to Washington's sacrifice, they've escaped. By morning, the Shannons arrive at the rebel camp. Maddy is reunited with Reynolds. Back at Terra Nova, Mira has returned from the ""Badlands,"" which she explored at Weaver's request. She found ""something"" -- something obviously special. But what is it? CUT to the rebel camp. Jim tells Taylor that Washington spoke of a past battle before her death. Taylor remembers the battle in which his forces were trapped and outnumbered on an island and blew up the only bridge so that the enemy couldn't bring reinforcements. Taylor likes the suggestion. He proposes to Jim that they blow up Hope Plaza. ""That means no more meds, no more technology, no more colonists,"" Jim warns. ""We'll just have to survive out here with what we've got."" Grunts Taylor: ""We'll survive. But, first, let's kick some ass."" Jim then breaks the news to Elisabeth -- and readies for war.

Taylor soon arrives with two soldiers -- Reynolds and Dunham -- dressed in Phoenix Group uniforms taken from not-so-fortunate enemies. Back at Terra Nova, Skye approaches Lucas and begs his forgiveness. ""What if I told you that I knew how to get in touch with your father?"" Skye asks. She offers to lure Taylor into an ambush -- and leads Lucas to a spot in the jungle. Of course, the ambush turns out to be for Lucas, who is soon surrounded by Taylor's men. Skye smirks at Lucas. CUT to Jim, who hides in the cargo hold of a Phoenix truck driven by Dunham and Reynolds. The disguised soldiers unload the cargo and send it through the portal, hurtling Jim back to the future.

So Jim arrives in 2149 -- just as Lucas manages to escape his bonds and BASH Skye's head into the side of the rover. Meanwhile, Taylor and Elisabeth watch the portal through binoculars. Taylor tells Elisabeth that once the portal is ""un-tethered,"" Jim will return to the past within three clicks of the location. They'll just have to find him. CUT to Jim, who hides in the cargo bin as Weaver explains to some well-dressed old men that they are all now very rich. Jim notices that the cargo bin contains a dino. He releases the creature from its cage just as Weaver opens the door. The dino ATTACKS the baddies, crushing one underfoot. As Weaver flees, Jim sneaks out of the bin and disappears into the depth of the industrial complex. He fights off some guards and then arms the bomb.

CUT back to the past, where Taylor gets a call from Skye: Lucas has escaped and is likely heading toward the portal. Sure enough, Taylor intercepts his son, KNOCKING him to the ground. ""This is the first time I'm glad your mother is dead,"" Taylor says. ""She would be so ashamed of what you have become."" Lucas begins to weep, and reaches up to hug his father -- and STABS him in the gut. Suddenly, a SHOT rings out. Lucas falls to the ground, shot by Skye. She then runs to Taylor, who is gasping in pain.

CUT to the future, where Jim rounds a corner and discovers Weaver holding a gun. ""Do you know what you've cost us!?"" Weaver screams. Just then, the dino appears and BITES Weaver's head, whipping him back and forth. Jim turns and sprints toward the portal with the dino in hot pursuit. Behind them, the facility EXPLODES. CUT to the past, where Jim emerges from the jungle to embrace Elisabeth. Mission accomplished. Skye, meanwhile, goes to Lucas's body, but discovers it is gone. The Taylor boy lives.

Later that night, a Phoenix soldier explains to Mira that Hope Plaza has been destroyed. ""We're stuck here ... forever,"" he says. Mira's jaw drops. She will never again see her daughter. The next morning, the surviving rebels return home to Terra Nova and are greeted by a throng of recently liberated citizens. Turns out the remaining Phoenix Group soldiers -- about 100 men -- have all retreated to the north ... to the Badlands. But why? Taylor and Jim then open the cargo bin containing the ""something special"" that Mira found in the Badlands. It contains what appears to be an ancient statue. ""It's not a statue,"" Taylor says. ""It's the prow of a ship."" An 18th century ship from the looks of it. So how did it arrive in the past? What is in the Badlands? What does the Phoenix Group know?

But those are questions for another day. The long ordeal ends with the Shannons watching a meteor shower from their porch inside Terra Nova. Safe. For now."

Marilyn abruptly pulls away and asks Tom whether he'd like to come in for a minute and ""meet her folks."" Tom protests, and asks why it's necessary that he meet them. Marilyn states that she has been out with him a lot, and that her folks want to meet both him and his family. Tom puts his arm around Marilyn's waist and attempts to kiss her, but she backs away. She states that her folks are ""sort-of- old-fashioned.""

Tom then suggests that he'll have his parents invite her folks to the party to which Marilyn had already been invited the following week. ""It is your Aunt and Uncle, isn't it?"" he inquires. Tom had rested his hand on the window frame of the house as he spoke, and when he mentions Marilyn's family a sudden gust of wind blows the shutter slamming into his knuckles, and he gasps. Marilyn affirms that it is her Aunt and Uncle with whom she lives, and that they've had her since she was a baby. Tom makes another attempt to kiss Marilyn, and she smiles and lets him kiss only her neck.

The dingy curtains are pulled back from a window next to the door. Peeking out is (Fred Gwynne), an extremely tall man resembling the Universal Studio's Frankenstein Monster, complete with flat top head, a jagged scar running down his forehead, and bolts on each side of his neck. He grins broadly as he assesses the scene. Herman soon retreats to the interior of the gloomy mansion, and addresses a beautiful woman in a shroud, (Yvonne De Carlo), who's pale complexion and exaggerated make-up give her the look of a walking corpse. She sits calmly doing needlework in the image of a large black widow spider. Herman says that this is the forth date that Marilyn has had with this young man, and Lily replies how amazing it is that some boys will overlook a girl's appearance. Herman hears Marilyn's entrance into the house and shushes Lily.

Marilyn says that she had a good time with this young man, and that she thinks that both Herman and Lily are to be invited to a party being hosted by his parents. Lily and Herman appear pleased, and Herman says that ""it's high time that we met this young man's parents. You can't be too careful these days. There are a lot of strange people in this world."" Lily thinks the idea is wonderful since ""we don't get out at night as much as we used to.""

Marilyn says she's about to go to bed and bids her Aunt Lily and Uncle Herman good night, but before she climbs the stairs to her room, she remembers, ""Oh, by-the-way, Tom says it's going to be a masquerade party!"" Herman and Lily both appear disappointed by this. Herman remarks that he wishes it wasn't a masquerade party since it disturbs him for grown people like us dressing up in costume and looking ridiculous. The scene fades to black.

An odd and upbeat Gothic instrumental now plays, incorporating both harpsichords and tubas.

The Opening Credits roll:

We fade in to Lily Munster standing before a cobweb laden staircase, coyly smiling as she twirls a lock of her long black hair between her fingers. Her face is deathly pale and she seems to be in a nightgown. The main title ""The Munsters"" fades in over Lily in wavy optical in typography resembling melted candle wax, and then fades out. The screen freezes for a moment and reads ""Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily"" in the same typography as the title.

(Al Lewis) enters the screen from the right, and Lily extends her hand to him. He is pale as a ghost and dressed in late 19th Century men's formal attire. Grandpa takes her hand and acts as if he is going to kiss the back of it, but quickly turns it over and attempts to bite the inside of her wrist. Lily quickly draws her hand away, frowns and sternly wags her finger at Grandpa, who then shrugs. The screen freezes for a moment and reads ""Al Lewis as Grandpa."" He exits.

Marilyn Muster immediately enters from the left, holding schoolbooks in her arms. Lily smiles to greet her and Marilyn give Lily a small kiss on her cheek. The screen freezes for a moment, and reads ""Beverly Owen as Marilyn."" Lily affectionately touches Marilyn's neck and Marilyn exits as Lily waves her goodbye.

Next (Butch Patrick), a small boy with pointed ears, a prominent widow's peak, and dressed in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit comes bounding down the stairs behind Lily. She grabs some schoolbooks which are held together by a belt and hands them to the boy, and pats his cheeks with both her hands at once. Eddie rolls his eyes and grimaces as the screen freezes for a moment and reads ""Butch Patrick as Eddie."" He runs off.

Next, a trap door in the middle of the staircase raises up high over Lily's head, and Herman Munster strides out from under the stairs. Lily looks over her shoulder to him, and bends to grab a briefcase to hand him as he walks by. He takes it and continues, but Lily lightly taps him on his arm, and offers up her cheek for a kiss. Herman bends down and delivers a peck on her cheek and she smiles, and waves goodbye. Herman walks off with a huge grin on his face as the screen freezes for a moment and reads, ""Fred Gwynne as Herman."" He exits as Lily clutches her hands over her heart in a swoon.

Over a wide shot of the spooky mansion, the episode title ""Munster Masquerade"" appears in the same candle wax typography. The writing and technical credits roll over the same backdrop, which features the dilapidated mansion continually illuminated by lighting, and surrounding trees and shrubs that are tossed by heavy winds. The credits and the music end.

Fade in to a lavish interior which is the home of society matron Agnes Daly (Mabel Albertson) who sits wearing a smart black dress and pearls, as she inscribes names into her address book. Behind her is her son Tom in a light-toned dinner jacket and tie, and her husband, Albert Daly () in a tie and shirtsleeves. Agnes says that she is glad to invite Tom's ""little girlfriend Marilyn"" to their party, but inviting her ""whole family"" seems a little too much to her. Agnes inquires as to ""just who are the Munsters?"" Tom assures her that Marilyn's Aunt and Uncle are ""lovely, charming people"" like Marilyn. But she worries that the society columns in the newspaper will misspell The Munsters name and she'd ""hate to have my friends read that we'd entertained a couple of monsters!"" She haughtily exits leaving the two men alone, and Tom approaches his father and thanks him for putting in a good work with his mother. Tom says that it will help him stay in good favor with Marilyn. ""You know how it is,"" he tells his father. Albert confesses that he hasn't known how it is for years. Albert exits, leaving Tom with a worried expression on his face.

A large hand with a black thumbnail holds a letter addressed to Mr. & Mrs Herman Munster, 1313 Mockingbird Lane, Glennwood. The handwriting has a distinct back slant. Herman and Lily are revealed standing in their foyer, and Herman posits that if the Daly's are anything like their handwriting, they must ""fall over backward a lot."" Lily thinks that going to the party is a good idea, since it will give them a chance to look over Tom's family, whom she has never heard of. Grandpa enters and peruses the invitation. ""After all,"" Lily says, ""we Munsters are from a very old family.""

Herman agrees with, ""You're right, Lily. It's not like someone just dug us up yesterday."" Then Grandpa becomes agitated since he realizes that he hasn't been invited to the masquerade. He says that he's never ""been so insulted since the day I died."" And he thinks that as Marilyn's grandfather, he should be there. Herman says that they don't know the Daly's, and they cannot extend an invitation to Grandpa, who threatens that if he's not invited he will turn himself into chopped liver and show up in the apetitizers. Lily attempts to calm Grandpa who sits on the stairs and continues to insist on going to the party. Grandpa says that if he's not taken along to the party he'll ""sit here and hold my breath until the color comes back to my cheeks."" Lily relents, and agrees to call the Dalys and wangle an invitation for Grandpa.

Agnes Daly speaks on the telephone to Lily, and graciously extends and invitation to Grandpa. Albert Daly enters the room as she hangs up the telephone, and Agnes tells him that she thinks that the Munsters are ""frightful pushers,"" since Lily ""wheedled an invitation for some old Grand-papa they've got kicking around the house."" She says that the only worse thing that could happen would be if it were to rain on the night of the party.

The rain is pouring down on the Munster home, and thunder grumbles and the lightning flashes. Eddie Munster looks out the window and expresses that he thinks the lightning is cool and he hopes that it hits their house. Marilyn Munster enters, dressed in a colonial pilgrim dress. She asks Eddie what he thinks of her costume as Priscilla. Eddie tells her it's corny, and she'd be better off dressed as something pretty, like a lady gorilla. Eddie asks Marilyn who will be his babysitter, and she tells him that it will be Mrs. Morton, the mother of one of her girlfriends.

Herman Munster enters, dressed in a full suit of armour, with his face covered by the metal flap on the helmet. Marilyn tells him that he makes a wonderful King Arthur, and Eddie jumps up on the furniture to check if Herman is inside the suit of armour. He lifts up the flap on the helmet, and Herman smiles and says ""Hello, there."" Marilyn inquires as to what Aunt Lily is coming as, and Herman states that Lily hasn't let him see her costume, since she's being coy.

Lily's offstage voice is heard saying ""Yoo hoo."" Her hand flutters out from around a corner, and her fingers wave in the air.

""Lily?"" Herman inquires.

""Guess who,"" says Lily.

She steps out from around the corner, and says ""Little Bo Peep."" She wears a huge blond wig of sausage curls, and an elaborate gown with frills and ruffles, and carries an ornate shepherd's staff. Herman is startled and taken aback and the metal flap on his helmet slams down. Lily twirls around to display her costume and asks, ""How do I look?""

""Awful,"" says Herman.

""Thank you,"" replies Lily.

Lily gives Eddie instructions to feed Spottie, and not to forget to wash behind his points, and then sends him off to bed. The Munsters all bid Eddie a good night. The door in the cuckoo clock on the wall opens and a raven sticks his head out and states the time as 8:09, and continues to follow that up with the repeated line ""Nevermore."" Eddie rushes over and reaches up and closes the door on the raven, telling him to ""Pipe down.""

Loud banging can be heard from the front door, and Marilyn rushes to answer it. She opens the door and Tom Daly enters the house in a swirl of wind and dry leaves. He is dressed as a Mayflower pilgrim, wearing a wig and holding a hat. He tells Marilyn that the weather is crazy since it is only raining on their block of the street. Marilyn tells Tom she'd like him to meet her Aunt and Uncle. Marilyn first introduces Tom to Lily, and he gently shakes her hand. Tom tells Lily that she has quite a house, and he turns around to see Herman standing stiffly in his full suit of armour with the metal flap on the helmet closed, concealing his face. Tom looks at the armor and says, ""This is quite a relic,"" and bangs on the helmet with his knuckles. Marilyn calls out Tom's name, and tells him that her Uncle is in there. Tom apologizes to Herman, who says ""Gad Zooks, that smarts."" Tom decides that Marilyn and he should head off to the party, and before he goes he apologizes once again to Herman who assures him that it was quite all right, and after Tom exits Herman mumbles that it was nice bumping into him.

Herman rushes over near a wall and pull back part of the rug. He stomps on a trap door in the floor, causing the entire house to shake. He calls out to Grandpa and tells him to hurry up. Downstairs in Grandpa's laboratory, the cobweb covered vials and glass containers shake on the shelves. Grandpa says he's still working on his costume. He selects a vial labeled ""Mr. Hyde,"" and says it will be perfect especially since it got Fredric March ""his first Academy Award."" He opens the jar and waves it beneath his nose, smelling the contents. He mixes it in a beer stein with a large white pill and some seltzer water, says ""Cheers"" and drinks the potion. He holds up a hand mirror and looks at his face, and urges the potion to take effect. Suddenly he grimaces, and grabs his neck with both hands. He wails and falls onto the floor beside the counter. He moans and gasps for air as he pulls himself back up to the counter, revealing only his back. He grabs the mirror and looks into it, and sees his face exactly as it was before taking the potion. He disgustedly picks up the vial containing the potion, looks upward and says that ""somebody up there has been cutting this stuff again."" He smells the jar, and puts it on on the counter.

Upstairs Lily primps and adjusts her curls in the parlor. She advises Herman that no matter what the Dalys are like, he is to be gracious and polite. Herman assures her that he will be a gentleman, and Lily cuddles up against Herman's suit of metal. She coos and tells him that he ""feels so nice and cold.""

At the Daly residence, Agnes fusses over her table settings. She is dressed elaborately as Shakespeare's Juliet. She calls out for Albert and asks if he's ready, since the guest will be arriving shortly. As she walks to the next room she reminds Albert not to do or say anything to offend the Munsters, if only for the sake of their son Tom. Albert is seen looking into a mirror and fixing his make-up. He turns around to reveal that he is dresses as the Frankenstein monster, and looks almost exactly like Herman. Albert assures Agnes that he has no intention of offending the Munsters at all.

Back at 1313 Mockingbird Lane, Lily is taking the coat of Mrs. Morton (Lurene Tuttle), telling her that her son Eddie is playing in his room. Both women agree that Eddie will be no trouble at all, with Mrs. Morton telling Lily that she's been a babysitter for twenty years, and nothing fazes her anymore. She walks down the few steps into the parlor, and stops in front of a giant cobweb.

In the other room, Herman waits near the trapdoor in the floor, and it opens and Grandpa emerges from his lab. He is dressed to look like Napoleon Bonaparte. Herman tells Grandpa that ""he really looks like Napoleon.""

""It was easy,"" says Grandpa, ""I just combined the bottles marked Charles Boyer, General De Gaulle and Marlon Brando.""

Herman adjusts Grandpa's hat and exits to join Lily in the foyer. He tells Lily that they should be going, and Lily introduces Herman to a startled Mrs. Morton who stares at Herman as he greets her. Next Lily introduces Grandpa to the babysitter, who smiles sweetly at Grandpa. He takes her hand and bends down to kiss it, but instead starts to bare his teeth until Lily chides him and he releases her hand and waves it off.

Before Herman and Grandpa walk out, Herman expressed disappointment in that it stopped raining. Grandpa tells him to try and not let that spoil his evening. After they exit, Lily turn to Mrs. Morton and tells her to make herself at home, and warns her that if Eddie's pet Spottie comes scratching at the back door, don't let him in. ""Last time he ate the sofa,"" she says. Mrs. Morton smiles and agrees for a moment, and then looks very confused and befuddled. She turns and walks to the parlor.

Herman, Lily and Grandpa approach the front entrance of the Daly house. Herman warns Grandpa not to ""get silly after having two drinks and start telling those shaggy wolf stories again."" Lily insists that they make a good impression. Grandpa assures them that he will act with dignity. Agnes Daly opens the door and greets the Munsters. She is dressed as ""Juliet"" from the Shakespeare tragedy.

Herman introduces himself and the others, and Agnes presents her hand to Grandpa. He takes it and turns it over as he bares his teeth as if to sink them into Agnes' wrist. Lily strikes him with her Bo Peep staff as Herman tells him to knock it off. Grandpa then sweetly kisses Agnes' hand, giving Herman and Lily a disappointed look.

Back on Mockingbird Lane, Mrs. Morton is perusing the place when she sees black ""Kitty"" reclining on the back of the sofa. Delighted, Mrs. Morton bends and speaks to the cat in a loving motherly voice in an attempt to befriend it. Kitty lets loose a loud lion's roar into Mrs. Morton's surprised face, and then glances about casually. The intercom buzzes and Mrs. Morton picks up the receiver to hear Eddie ask to skip his bath tonight because they're all out of scalding water. She agrees and tells him to get ready for bed. The Raven and Kitty create a ruckus as Mrs. Morton exits the room.

Over at the Daly's party, costumed guests are dancing to a swinging instrumental melody. Herman in his full armor, is trying to drink a martini through the face plate. Grandpa comes to assist him, but gets distracted by a pretty girl and accidentally dumps the drink down into Herman's suit of armor. Grandpa gets annoyed by Herman and closes his helmet. Marilyn finds Grandpa and persuades him to go dance with Agnes Daly. Herman tries to shake the liquid out of his suit of armor.

Grandpa compliments Agnes as they dance a minuet, telling her she reminds him of one of his one-hundred-and-sixty-seven wives, all of whom now dead. Grandpa doesn't miss them, because he visits them often. Agnes breaks off the dance, and storms away. Grandpa shrugs. Agnes rushes over to her son Tom, and chastises him for making her invite ""those horrible people."" She wants Grandpa cut off from having any more alcohol.

Lily dances with an admirer, who compliments her on how light on her feet she is. He tells her that it seems like she's dancing on air, and she giggles and replies that it's funny he should say that. Lily's feet are six inches off the floor as they gracefully dance. Marilyn approaches Herman, and encourages him to introduce himself to Mr. Daly. Herman agrees and without lifting up the face plate on his helmet, walks over to an area where a group of costumed people are sitting, he meets Mr. Daly, who is in a Universal Studio's Frankenstein's Monster costume, which is not unlike how Herman looks. Herman tells Mr. Daly that he reminds him of someone he knows. Herman tells Mr. Daly that it's a shame that he couldn't get a costume for his own masquerade party and walks away. Mr Daly takes offense and tells Mrs. Daly of his displeasure in meeting The Munsters.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Morton has fallen asleep in a chair, when she is awakened by a loud wolf's howl. She suspiciously eyes Kitty, who sits innocently on a large open book. As she gets up, Mrs Morton realizes that her arms and hands have been covered in cobwebs. She rushes to the staircase and calls for Eddie, who reassures her that it was he who made the howling, as it's something he always does when the moon comes up. Eddie then calls out for Spot, and Mrs. Morton doesn't see the shadow of a huge dragon apparently walking up the stairs to Eddie's room.

Tom Daly makes his way through dancing masqueraders to find Marilyn. He asks her to leave with him to someplace more private. Marilyn express concern that their two families are not getting along. Tom says he'll take care of it, and walks to Grandpa, takes his arm and leads him over to Agnes Daly at the buffet table. Tom puts a plate in Grandpa's hand, and Agnes tells Grandpa that he will find something to his liking at the buffet. Grandpa says he will and he spoons some fire from a dish warmer, and swallows it. Smoke leaks from his lips. He then spoons some fire onto Agnes's plate, who looks agast.

Mrs. Morton takes a glass of milk to Eddie's room. He asks her to put it under the door. She bends down and puts the glass though a dog door at the bottom of Eddie's bedroom door. She tells him to go to bed, and he agrees. As Mrs. Morton walks away she hear the loud creaking of a large door slowly being closed. She nervously laughs and hurries away, as she fiddles with a lace handkercheif.

Back at the party, guests move an endtable to enable Agnes to stand up on it and announce that she's giving a magnum of champage to the guest in the best costume. Party-goers gasp and applaud, and then begin to shout out the famous names of some of the incognito revelers. An inebriated guest standing next to Herman yells, ""I vote for King Arthur. Come on, take your helmut off!"" Herman's helmut is lifted off his head by bystanders, and, now exposed for the first time, he grins at everyone. A man loudly expresses surprise that Herman is wearing one mask actually under another mask. Everyone laughs. Agnes Daly quizically grimaces and looks around, then presents the large champagne bottle to Herman.

Herman graciously accepts the champagne, and makes a pun about King Arthur and a ""night."" The party-goers laugh and applaud. Lily rushes from across the room to Herman, and tells him that they're all leaving the party. Herman doesn't understand why Lily wants to leave when he has just won a prize. She reminds him that it was for wearing one mask under another. Herman follows Lily to the foyer, and Lily asks Herman if he knows when he's been insulted. She says those people tried to make a fool of him. Herman bends to look into the hallway mirror hanging on the wall. The mirror shatters.

Herman realizes that it is his own face that won the masquarade contest, and he becomes annoyed. Grandjpa, Lily and Herman exit. Marilyn approaches Tom Daly, and accuses his family of plotting against her Uncle Herman, and demands that Tom take her home. Tom doesn't understand why Herman would be upset, since he just won first prize in the costume contest. He says that Marilyn had told him that her family was a ""fun family."" Revelers including Albert Daly continue to twist to the swinging music.

Now at home, Herman stretches and audibly yawns, still in his full amour and helmut. He and Lily are escorting Mrs. Morton out of the house. Mrs. Morton makes a quick exit, after saying that Eddie was no problem, except for the howling -- which she got used to. After Mrs. Morton leaves Lily wonders why Mrs. Morton would have been disconcerted by Eddie's howling, since Lily believes that all children howl when the moon comes up. She shrugs.

Herman and Lily sit in their living room before the fire. Herman reads from a book and Lily sips from a steaming ceramic mug. They hear footfalls on the porch, and Lily states it's Tom bringing Marilyn home. Lily then worries that Marilyn and Tom's relationship is becoming too serious, fretting that she certainly doesn't want Tom's parents in the Munster family.

Tom Daly has escorted Marilyn to the front door of the Munster house. He sees that no lights are on inside, and infers that her family hasn't yet arrived home. He asks to be invited inside, to which Marilyn doesn't agree. He tells her that John Alden wouldn't let Priscilla go into that cold dark house alone. Marilyn uses a key to open the door and Tom pushes his way into the house behind her. Marilyn turns and pushes Tom back, and says that now she will make some coffee. She tells him to go into the living room and turn on a light. He tells her not to be long, as he turns to go into the living room. He switches on the lights which quickly illuminate the scene of Herman and Lily relaxing in the living room. Both have now removed their costumes, and are in their everyday attire. They both stand to greet Tom, and Herman tells him that they have just removed their masquarade costumes. Tom stares at Herman and Lily incredusously, and mutters some incoherent questions, his face twisted into fright, and soon the hair on the back of his head flies straight up into the air. Tom scrables out the front door of the Munster home and onto the street.

Herman, Lily and Marilyn look out the door after Tom, with Marilyn asking Herman what happend, and why is Tom running. Herman doesn't know why, but claims that it was rude of Tom to leave without saying goodbye. Lily agrees, but adds that considering Tom's family, one shouldn't expect him to have manners. Marilyn proposes that she herself has ""scared another one away,"" but this time she's kind of glad. Herman pats Marilyn on the shoulder and admits that he thought there was something strange about Tom since he ""had the weirdest hairdo"" he's ever seen. Herman slowly closes the front door to the Munster house, revealing a large dragon-type door knocker covered in cobwebs with large round crystaline eyes. The scene disolves into the closing credits, where a reprise of the opening theme song plays with the spooky house at 1313 Mockingbird Lane as a backdrop."

She answers an ad for a doctor in the Colorado territory, hoping to continue practicing medicine on her own despite her gender and mother's lack of support.

When she arrives in Colorado Springs in 1867, she is met with derision and hostility by most of the townspeople except Charlotte Cooper (Diane Ladd) and ""mountain man"" Byron Sully (Joe Lando). Charlotte is matron of the local boarding house and struggling to support her three children, Matthew (Chad Allen), Colleen (Erika Flores), and Brian (Shawn Toovey), after her husband skipped town with their savings.

Sully is a reclusive loner who befriended the neighboring Cheyenne and adopted their ways following the death of his wife and daughter during childbirth in 1865. (He is also a sensitive hunk who throws a mean tomahawk.) Charlotte helps Dr. Mike acclimatize and they bond. Sully offers Dr. Mike his abandoned homestead to live in and she accepts. Charlotte, also the town midwife, calls upon Dr. Mike to help with a difficult delivery, and she successfully performs a ""radical"" cesarean section.

Charlotte is bitten by a rattlesnake and on her deathbed asks Dr. Mike to care for her children. Dr. Mike begins to have more success with the townspeople as a female doctor, but continues to experience hardships and has trouble winning the hearts of the Cooper children. Brian runs away and Sully helps Dr. Mike find him.

She is hit especially hard after failing to get a shipment of medicine in time to treat Maude Bray, who suffers a fatal heart attack. She is hurt and upset by a discouraging letter from her mother which she shares with the Cooper children who finally realize she will be a loving mother and raise them properly.

After the army carries out a vicious surprise attack on the Cheyenne, Sully brings the grievously injured Chief Black Kettle to the homestead, and Dr. Mike saves his life. When he leaves, Chief Black Kettle gives Dr. Mike her Cheyenne name, ""Medicine Woman"". The town grudgingly begins to accept her as a woman doctor. A surprise visit at the homestead by Sully on Christmas Eve shows Dr. Mike that she has found her place in the new frontier and inherited a loving family."

Matthew wants to give to them some food, but Ingrid's brother, Jon, insists on working to mend fences to 'pay' for food. Brian and Sully go hunting and find an injured deer, which Brian takes a special interest in, asking Dr. Mike to 'fix her.' In the process, Brian wants to name the deer after Sully and asks him what his first name is. ""Byron"" is the reply. While mending the fences, Jon notices the many cattle.

His confidence is eroded even further when his dad threatens to ground him forever if he flunks his test. Desperate, he calls Max to help him study. Max offers to either help PJ cheat on the test or make him a math genius for life. PJ chooses ""brains over con,"" and Max gets to work.

Max rigs up a contraption that rewards PJ with a candy bar if he gets an answer right, but lobs a raw egg in his face if he gets it wrong. With Max's help, PJ memorizes his math book forty-seven times, but freaks out the next morning when his dad first offers him an egg, then suggests a candy bar for breakfast.

At school, Max tells PJ he'll ace the test, no problem. After the test, however, PJ says all he remembers from the test is ""flying eggs and stuff."" He panics when he thinks he may have flunked his test, as that would get him grounded for life. PJ says his dad will get his report card in the next day's 3:30pm mail. Max says that this gives PJ 23 hours and 14 minutes to do everything he ever wanted in his entire life.

Early the next morning, PJ makes a list of what he wants to do before he gets grounded for life, but realizes he can't do any of it because they have school. Max suggests that PJ pretend to be sick, but PJ says his dad won't keep him home unless he's a walking corpse. In response, Max grabs a medical book, combines symptoms for two different diseases (Outer Mongolian Worry Warts and Peruvian Pus-Face), and gussies PJ up to appear to have them both. The result works too well, however, as Pete calls an ambulance to send his son to the hospital, much to Max's dismay.

Max follows PJ to the hospital and gets him out, while Dr. Howard, the attending emergency room physician, discovers that PJ was faking his symptoms. Dr. Howard tries to tell Pete, even handing him PJ's list, which he dropped when Max grabbed him. When Pete reads the list, he misunderstands its title, ""Stuff I Want to Do on My Last Day,"" thinking that PJ is now dying. Pete runs after the kids before Dr. Howard can fully explain what happened.

PJ realizes he dropped his list, but Max says he remembers it by heart: 200 Gorilla burgers, watch all twelve Mutilator movies, ride down Hairpin Hill in a shopping cart, kiss Cynthia Snodfrue, and go on the three worst rides in Terrorland. They execute each of the items on PJ's list, with Pete in pursuit. Pete finally catches up to the kids at Terrorland, but Max persuades him to let PJ finish the items on his list.

The kids return home before PJ's report card arrives. Dr. Howard calls Pete to let him know that PJ was faking his illness. Furious that PJ cut school over a test, Pete grounds his son for life.

When Peg gets home, she tells Pete that PJ got an A in math. Elated at PJ's grade, Pete grabs his stunned son and takes him out celebrating, promising even more rewards when he passes his science test next week."

He attempts to wake P.J., but also ends up bothering Pete in the process.

The boys try to figure out what they want to do, eventually settling on holing up in their tree house. They set up a machine rigged to fire multiple water balloons at their selected target - the Petes' dog. When the dog runs to Pistol for refuge, Max and P.J. target her too. Pistol runs to her dad for help, but the boys are unable to stop their water balloon weapon before it runs out of ammo.

Goofy, Pete, and the boys get into an argument about what happened, and Peg yells at them to be quiet. She tells Goofy and Pete to take their sons elsewhere so she and Pistol can enjoy some peace and quiet. This gives them the idea to take the boys camping.

Goofy takes Max to a campsite, where they meet Pete and P.J. Goofy and Pete argue over the campsite, while the boys are elated to see each other. Pete drags his son off to teach him about camping, while Goofy does the same with Max. Goofy teaches his son the three rules of camping - be clean, be courteous, and be careful. To illustrate the last part, he ties their food out of the reach of bears.

Meanwhile, Humphrey the Bear and his son see Goofy and Max tying up the food and raid it, but a series of mishaps with the dads leaves Max and P.J. alone, where they find Humphrey's son alone as well. The baby bear, however, wander off before they can catch him. Max suggests they go after the baby bear, but P.J. is reluctant to follow. Meanwhile, Pete finds himself face to face with Humphrey and takes off, running into Goofy. Trying to tell Goofy about bears, Pete gets into an argument with him, leading both to decide to leave. When they can't locate the boys, however, they see bear tracks and immediately panic, thinking bears got ahold of Max and P.J.

As Pete gathers an array of traps and equipment to track down the bear, Humphrey realizes his son is missing. When he sees a steel-jaw trap, he fears his son is dead and immediately flies into a rage. Meanwhile, Max and P.J. find Humphrey's son. Max is eager to help, but P.J., worried about the baby bear's parents, has his doubts.

Pete rigs up a trap to catch Humphrey, using Goofy as bait. When the bear attacks, however, Pete is unable to stop him. Goofy tries to rescue Pete, but ends up landing on Humphrey's back. Humphrey chases Goofy and Pete and the trio get into a melee just as their sons find them, immediately stopping the fight. Reunited with their boys, Goofy, Pete, and Humphrey relax around a campfire that night as Max and P.J. toast marshmallows over the fire."

P.J. shows up and Max drags him off to go skateboarding. Max says his dad's a klutz when it comes to anything mechanical, but P.J. says that at least he lets him help - when Pete's working, he doesn't want to be bothered.

They see Pete working at his used-car lot. Max suggests they go bum a soda from him, but P.J. nixes the idea, saying he's definitely working, as he's wearing his sales glasses. Max wanders onto the lot anyway and helps Pete close a sale by hyping up a car. Pete rewards Max with a soda while chiding P.J. for not helping him that way. Pete asks Max to come over later that night to help him with his Pete-mobile, which P.J. says is a top secret recreational vehicle that he's working on.

Pete shows Max the RV, saying he's entering it in the big show in Las Vegas. Max suggests adding a satellite dish. Pete agrees, saying that Max reminds him of himself. With Max's help, Pete outfits the RV with various components taken from Pete's house. Max also enlists P.J.'s help to get Goofy's garage door.

With the RV complete, Pete unveils it to everyone, and they head off to Las Vegas. During the trip, Pete gives Max his sales glasses in appreciation for his work in getting the RV ready. As the gang tries out the different functions in the RV, however, they malfunction, causing the trailer where Goofy is using the hot tub to separate from the rest of the RV and the sofa where Peg and Pistol are sitting to swing out in the middle of oncoming traffic.

At a rest stop, Peg and Goofy give Pete an earful while a dejected P.J. goes off by himself, sitting on a nearby picnic table. Max asks P.J. to take a picture of him and the RV. P.J. tells Max to take the picture himself, saying if Max wants to be the son in the family he'll just move out.

As P.J. mopes, he throws a stick, which hits Goofy. P.J. apologizes, then asks Goofy if he looks dumb to him. Goofy says no, saying a chestnut is dumb. It looks ugly on the outside, but eventually the shell falls off and what's left is ""chock full of good stuff."" P.J.'s mood improves.

Meanwhile, two hoodlums try to pick the RV's locks, but Max catches them and tries a sales pitch on them. When he lets them in, however, they take off with him in it. Max yells for P.J., who immediately tells his dad about the RV. Pete commandeers a tow truck, which is unable to keep up with the RV, but Goofy, driving a sports car that the truck is towing, uses it to catch up. One of the thieves throws a pocketknife, which slashes one of the tires just as the car gets close to the RV. P.J., who is riding with Goofy, uses the opportunity to jump from the hood of the car to the ladder on the back of the RV.

P.J. makes his way into the RV and rescues Max. Using some chestnuts that he picked up while at the rest stop, P.J. activates the components in the RV that are malfunctioning, which subdues and eventually ejects the thieves. The boys try to control the RV, but the pedals fall off and the hand brake snaps when they try to use it. They end up driving the RV full speed into Las Vegas and the RV show, where they crash.

Pete threatens to ""simonize"" Max, but when he gets to the kids, he hears P.J. telling the judges about the RV. To both Pete's and P.J.'s surprise, the judges wholeheartedly agree and give P.J. the award for best design.

Pete showers P.J. with compliments, taking the sales glasses from Max and giving it to his son. Max asks his dad about the chestnuts, and both Goofy and P.J. laugh in response."

Pete showers her with a laundry list of his accomplishments, but when she says she's going to interview Goofy, he quips that It'll be a really short meeting.

Meanwhile, Max is thumbing through one of his dad's yearbooks but is disappointed when he learns that Goofy didn't participate in any sports in school. Goofy sees an old photo of himself and remarks that Max looks just like him, much to Max's dismay. Max becomes even more chagrined when Jean says the same thing upon meeting the two of them. When Jean hears Goofy's stories, she realizes she can't use any of them. She hands Max a blank form and tells him to fill it out if his dad comes up with anything.

Max goes out to the backyard, where he meets P.J., who says the same thing - Max looks just like his dad. P.J. asks Max to teach him a skateboard maneuver, but when P.J. tries it, the ramp collapses. Max says they need a bigger ramp - like the one P.J.'s dad is building for a publicity stunt, with professional skateboarder Slammer McTwist slated to ride down it.

Max and P.J. sneak into Pete's lot, where Max takes a couple runs down the unfinished ramp before Pete catches him and kicks the kids off the ramp. As they leave, Pete yells after Max that he's just a carbon copy of his dad - a goof.

That night, at dinner, Goofy decides to cheer up his son by saying he's going to win an award for doing something exciting. The next day, however, Goofy attempts several stunts, but fails at all of them. Max suggests they go to a pizzeria in an effort to boost his dad's morale, but they get caught in traffic near Pete's RV lot.

Hearing Pete's announcement, Max asks his dad to raincheck the pizza, as he wants to see Slammer McTwist's stunt. McTwist comes out, but bails when he sees the ramp. Pete tries to get Slammer to return, but the latter says nobody's crazy enough to ride the ramp. Goofy volunteers to ride it

Max and P.J. try to show Goofy how to skateboard, but when Goofy has trouble just standing on the skateboard, Max takes him home and tucks him into bed. Still in a daze, Goofy wanders off to Pete's lot. Max overhears his dad and drags P.J. to the lot, but they're too late to stop Goofy from skating down the ramp.

The boys retrieve Goofy, drag him to P.J.'s house, and lock him in a closet. P.J. asks about the stunt, and Max says they're gonna do it. P.J. asks who's going to believe it's Goofy, and Max says everyone will, since he looks just like his dad.

Dressed in Goofy's high school sweater, the boys make their way to the top of the ramp. Meanwhile, Goofy tries to get Pistol to let him out of the closet. Pistol asks how Goofy could be in the closet and at her dad's car lot at the same time, and Goofy realizes that Max is there in his place.

At the RV lot, Pete cues Goofy to start down the ramp. P.J. tries to back out. Max says that his dad risked his neck to win that award, and he owes it to his dad to at least try. P.J. tells Max that if he gets the award, it'll be his, not his dad's. Max agrees, and the boys decide to call off the stunt. Before they can do anything, however, the skateboard they're on starts going down the ramp. Reaching the other end, the boys eagerly do two more runs before the ramp breaks apart, sending them airborne. Max recovers, and the boys end up skateboarding through Spoonerville before Goofy finally manages to catch up to them.

With Goofy's help, Max and P.J. make it back to the RV lot, where Jean greets them and says that what they did is worth an award any day. When Goofy arrives, however, Max tells Jean who he is, and she sadly says she can't give Goofy the award now. Max and Goofy apologize to each other, to which an exhausted P.J. says, ""*You're* sorry?"" before collapsing.

At the reunion banquet, a disappointed Goofy tells Max he failed him. Max, however, calls his dad awesome, saying he took on a ramp that Slammer refused to skateboard. Jean mentions one final award for ""best father and son in the class,"" because they would do anything for each other. Thinking the award is for him, Pete stands up, but when Goofy's name is called, he jumps up, knocking Pete over, to P.J.'s amusement. Goofy says that Max is just a chip off the old block. Max tries to downplay the comment, causing his dad to clap a hand over his mouth briefly before they hug."

But most of all, ""I love its anonymity.""

""The first thing you should know about me is that I'm a whore,"" she says. She explains the easiest way to spot a prostitute: look for the woman in the business suit.

She rises in the morning, talking to the camera. She wasn't abused by a relative, she doesn't have kids and she's never been addicted to anything, ""except for maybe the fourth season of 'The West Wing.'"" She's very high class. She does it because she loves sex and money. She even enjoys the sex. Plus, she's fundamentally lazy. She loves being her own boss. But she does have an ""agent."" And a client coming. She gets ready. Primping, painting.

She has certain rules.

Rule 1: keep life and job separate. Separate phones, bedrooms and sides of the closet, for Hannah and ""Belle."" Also, of course, get the money first. Rule 3: Safety. When the agency calls, ""no problem"" means everything's fine. ""No problemo,"" means there's a problem. A nervous-looking client waits. She gives him a towel and toothbrush. Hygiene is also a rule. She wears only men's cologne so as to never send a man home smelling like a woman. Finally: figure out what the client wants and give it to him. She takes her client by the hand and, in bed, asks him about his fantasies. He imagines a farm. She climbs astride and they talk farm dirty. Horses, stables, barns...that does the trick. Another satisfied customer.

She tells everyone she's a legal secretary. It's so boring no one ever asks her about it, not ever her best friend Ben. He has a girlfriend and no idea about Hannah's day job.

They look at expensive apartments, pretending like they can afford it. Chopsticks on the piano. The real estate agent is not amused. They leave.

Belle waits at a hotel bar. Trying to profile the client she's about to meet. His first time, so he must be newly retired, low self-esteem...it's a young hot guy. They get a drink and go up to the hotel room. She plies her trade, but it's not working. He's nervous, says the time is up and wants to leave. She tries a different approach, letting him watch. He says that's extraordinarily nice of her, but he has to go. She's befuddled and slightly offended, leaving a job unfinished. ""Well,"" she says, ""that's a first.""

At a meeting of all the girls. One of the girls owes the boss money. Stephanie, the madam, hands out a sketch of a man who's passing fake money. One of the girl's isnt there. Her boyfriend recognized the underwear he bought her for Christmas on the Web site. Belle wonders if she should get her pictures more pixilated, she couldn't bear if her parents found out.

She asks Stephanie if the guy she saw before called. Yes, he was more specific this time. He wanted the girl next door.

Back in Belle's apartment, she greets him, dressed casually. A little small talk and he's kissing her. Then more, on the couch. They don't even get their clothes all the way off before getting to business. The phone rings. Pause. ""No problem.""

After, he rubs her back and she drinks a glass of wine. He talks about his ex he was with for four years. He's not over her. They're comfortable, chatting. He wants to rub both sides of her back. He likes symmetry. Square numbers, palindromes - words that are spelled the same backwards and forwards. She accidentally offers up, ""Hannah."" Then freezes.

Cut to Hannah alone. Montage of her lazing around, being generally sexy.

She calls her agent, Stephanie, tells her not to give her that guy again. She writes a description of him under the word ""danger."" He wants Hannah and not ""Belle.""

The farm man from before returns. Belle has found him a saddle.

She doesn't want the youngest or richest clients. For her, the perfect client is one where she never has to be herself."

Dolled up in a black wig and feathers, she waits in line for the most prestigious adult party in the country. They have strict rules: you have to be under 40, educated, beautiful and part of a genuine couple. They have to turn over cell phones and cameras but can be reached by emergency number.

Her date quizzes her on his bio. She grabs champagne, but it's just for show. She doesn't drink when she's working. She checks out the people at the party. Exhibitionists, wall flowers, cool kids, people making out on couches. She starts kissing her date, who has, let's remember, hired a call girl for sex.. He tells her it's too early. He tells her he wants to wait. He wants to watch all the other men want her then later, when she's really desperate, he'll give in. Our sex worker looks a little repressed.

Walking out of the make-out room, she walks into a man and freaks out a little. She runs to the bathroom. She recognized him. She goes through her mental Rolodex of every man she's ever slept with. It takes a minute.

She sees him again and recognizes him, a novelist whom she adores. She approaches him, to apologize. He flirts. She likes it. He can tell she recognizes him, because she knows his name. She asks him if he'd like to go somewhere more private. Her date, Alexander, comes and steals her away. He tells her no one can have her but him. Perfect.

Later in the party, more nakedness. Guests get down to what the evening's about, except Belle. ""Here I am with the only possessive man at an orgy."" She distracts her date and sneaks off to find Jay the novelist.

A bell rings, a show is starting. Belle and Jay are left alone. The show is a woman with balloons taped all over her. They're popped one by one. Alexander is preoccupied. Belle sneaks off with Jay. They start to make-out.

It's getting intense when Jay's date joins them. A welcome addition. There's lots of writhing, but nothing serious yet. Belle stops. Shes worried about being caught. They tell her she could go home with them.

She realizes that it's very unprofessional to ditch a client and you should never let your personal desires get in the way of work. Nevertheless, she gets one of the waiters to fake a call for her. She tells her client she has to leave for personal reasons. He'll be reimbursed, but now he's the one looking repressed.

In the car on the way to make out with her dream novelist, she has seven cell phone messages waiting for her. She begs off from her assured night of threesome bliss. Personal reasons again.

Her sister has just had her baby, ruining Belle's chance to have the best sex of her life. Her mom and dad are there. So is her friend Ben. He brought a card, she didn't. She's still all dolled up. Ben finds her black wig in her bag. They coo at the baby.

She goes to talk to her dad. He's smoking. She roles him a cigarette. He asks her what she's been up to. She gives him a look like, ""Do you really want to know?"" and doesn't answer. There's just no right way to tell your pop you have sex with strangers for money.

Hannah rides home with Ben. He pulls the wig out of her bag and tries it on. He asks her if she's a little bit over-dressed for a work function, the excuse she'd offered.

She goes home, takes off her fancy clothes and climbs into bed. She pulls out Jay's novel and goes to bed with her favorite author. ""Just not in the way I would have liked."""

She puts on her best red heels and flags a black cab, her transport of choice. She says everything in her bag of goodies is important, but, flashing her little silver watch, time is more important. A lot can happen on an all-nighter.

She tells us that the current trend is the girlfriend service, and how she, who is no good at relationships in real life, could be the perfect girlfriend for one evening. Not the moody kind a guy has to figure out, but the absolute dream date. Fulfilling the need to be held, she reckons. Whereupon she meets her first john ever, a regular now, a sweet man she is clearly fond of, bringing him a Phillip Roth novel. Ash, her perfect regular. They compliment each other on their looks. He's married, but his wife hasn't had sex with him for five years. So she supposes they're both breaking the marriage contract.

They go upstairs to order room service. She gets paid her 1,500 pounds and he gets some of his money's worth.

Now what to do with the rest of the evening?

She casually stretches out her long legs over his bare back as he orders a bottle of South African wine from room service. He complains about work. For the viewer's benefit, she lays out the three rules of escort conversation: keep it light, no politics, no inflammatory topics (like wife questions, or anything too intimate).

They go another round because, hey, he paid for a full night.

He sleeps. She reads. She never actually sleeps with clients. She fidgets about, does all kinds of exercises, even tries a headstand. The night is long...

Boredom persists, and she goes to make a call in the bathroom. Ben's playing video games. His woman distracts him with nakedness, he gets off the phone. Belle has no one to entertain her.

She gets dressed, leaves the client a note saying she'll be right back. Just going out to buy cigarettes. She hangs out with the night desk man, guessing at guests' relationships to each other. She is good at the game, even susses out a tranny..

At the bar, she drinks a beer. A man joins her, chancing to ask if he knows her. ""I'm quite well known in certain circles.""

He propositions her. She decides to take him on. Normally the agency vets the clients, but on this spur of the moment, she checks him out herself. He is confident, well-heeled, clearly a man of means, and she figures he'll be quick and takes him on. She asks the desk man, who is surprised to find out that she is on the game, to help out using the baby-monitoring to listen in on client no. 1, and tells him where to find her in case she's needed. Sensing the camera's judging gaze she says, ""What? I've always been a bit of a tart.""

Up in the room, he orders her to strip, piece by piece, savoring it. They begin. He has remarkable stamina, accrediting it to being a seasoned marathon runner. He could just go on for hours. Last thing she wants right now. She's a bit worried about returning to her original client. But client No. 2 keeps going. Until she gets resourceful, using an intimate move most men will deny wanting, but usually seem to like.

She makes it back to Client No. 1's room in time to shower before he wakes up. She tosses the note. He'll never know. They finish his evening properly and say good-bye in the lobby right next to Client No. 2. But he doesn't see her. She gives the night desk man an envelope for his role in the freelance.

She hops in her cab. ""Even the girlfriend experience is like me as a real girlfriend: it starts out all exciting and passionate. Then I get bored, sleep with someone else, and leave.""

She reveals that, like everybody else on the night shift, she thinks about the money."

He has something to get off his chest. She's always been so nice to him. He doesn't want her to be nice to him.

She consults with her madam about domination. She wants to give it a try. The madam recommends someone, Sirona.

A pleather clad woman and a mute pleather-clad man show up at Belle's door. Sirona barks at the man to get on all fours. Belle offers her tea, then asks him. Sirona tells Belle he won't speak without permission.

Sirona makes sure Belle takes it seriously. She does. Sirona demonstrates a few commands. Then leaves Belle alone with the man, still on all fours. Sirona barks for him, he crawls over.

The working women chat. There's no sex in domination. How do you know when you're done? Belle asks. When her watch beeps.

She's also married, to a professor. He knows what she does. Belle envies being able to share it with someone. Pan down to under the table, where the man has been licking Sirona's boot. Sirona kicks him, lets Belle take a whack.

She pronounces Belle ready.

Belle preps. She goes to the sex shop, clears out her apartment. She misses Ben's call. She goes back to the sex shop. Misses another call from Ben.

She puts tarp over her windows. Misses another call from Ben. She sets up a saddle sort of contraption and candles. Her phone rings again. She sees it's Ben and doesn't answer.

She tries on her pleather. The doorbell rings. In walks the accountant. She gives him directions, including to put on a thong. He replies with an excited ""yes, Mistress.""

Belle tells us that she has a script she'll be working from. This has been agreed upon beforehand, right down to the insults, by exchanged e-mails. She ties him to the saddle chair and tells him to do whatever she tells him. She starts an escaped prisoner routine. He begs. She lashes him lightly. She digs her heels into him. He begs her to stop. She thinks he means it. A simple ""red, amber or green?"" assesses his enjoyment. Green. She puzzles over how she's supposed to tell he's having a good time, given that the job won't end the way hers usually do. He asks what to do next and she's out of ideas. She runs off and calls Sirona.

Cut to him carefully licking her toilet clean. ""And then do the kitchen,"" she tells him.

She checks her voice messages. All from Ben. She calls him up and chews him out for not telling her. He calls her a hypocrite for not telling him what she's up to anymore.

Belle takes it out on the client, getting into the whipping. Beating him until he cries ""red!"" She's freaked out. Asks him to get her out of her pleather. They share an awkward moment. They both apologize. Belle says she'll recommend someone else.

Hannah storms over to see Ben. She says maybe she is a hypocrite, but at least she's not a coward. They talk. He thought she wouldn't approve because she doesn't like his girlfriend. He knows she's keeping secrets. He just doesn't know they're naked secrets.

She just generally doesn't like girls, no specific problem with the sex part.

Ben walks in, she's supposed to be helping him find a suit. The woman at the dress shop thinks she's the bride. He says it's ok, she's just here to help.

They haven't discussed her job yet, but then they do. He asks if she was working as a prostitute the night her sister had a baby. Yes. Was she doing it when they were together? No. Does she have a madam? An agent, yes. Why does she do it? ""Would you believe me if I said I enjoyed it?"" What's she doing tonight? A threesome.

She refers to her client as lovely and he scoffs. Her Belle phone rings. It's her madam. She takes the call next to Ben. She'll be working with Naomi. He says he has to go. They argue about who's paying. It's settled when she pulls out a roll of bills.

One of the things Ben asked was how she got into it. A flashback answers. A one night stand went well and he gave her cab fare. Except, in the cab, she realized it was a lot more. She'd been paid for sex.

She goes to the threesome. ""I'm hardly a girl's girl, but I will go gay for pay.""

She meets Naomi. She asks what the client is like. Belle describes his personality. Naomi meant sexwise. She suggests good cop-bad cop. No refill for her, thanks. Good cop material, Naomi reckons. They prep, comparing lingerie and toys.

Belle's having fun. Ash arrives. Naomi tells Belle not to look scared. She reinforces the point with her tongue.

They go to work. Trying to decide who's going to do what, coordinating their responses. They're a very pleasing sight, decked out in the best finery as he enters the room. The sex is fun, and they throw in an extra touch of performance for good measure. Rounding it off manually. Belle steps in for Naomi when she needs to go to the bathroom, like roommates helping each other on homework.

Ash laughs at them debriefing. He read the book Belle gave him. He notices it's early. Two girls, half the time. Not that he feels short-changed. He thanks Belle tenderly and they snuggle, leaving Naomi out.

Back with their clothes on, Belle tells Naomi she had fun and asks if she'd like to hang out sometime. She asks if she means sex. No. Does she mean eating Hagen Daaz and watching Pretty Woman. No. Then yes, Naomi says. She asks Belle's real name. She tells her Hannah. They exchange numbers. Naomi walks out, then calls immediately to ask what Hannah's doing.

They eat on a park bench and swap war stories. The best present a client ever gave Naomi: a Mini convertible. The worst present a client ever gave Belle: a hotel sewing kit. Naomi notices Hannah checking her phone. She tells her about waiting to hear from Ben. They talk about how hard it is to tell people.

Hannah has made a female friend. They can talk about men, sex and work. Because they're all the same thing. They go sex toy shopping together, bond.

Hannah's napping when her cell phone rings. Her madam. Belle asks if she can take a booking next week's Wednesday. Belle says no because that's her regular with Ashok. The madam tells her Ashok's with Naomi. Hannah's bummed.

She tells herself at some point his tastes were bound to change. She deletes Naomi from her phone. She's upset because there's no one she can call to say she had a bad day at work.

She calls Ben. She starts crying. She asks him to come over. He does. He tells her she looked good in the wedding dress. He brought her food.

He apologizes for how he acted the other day. She's the only girl he's ever slept with who still likes him. Except his fiancée. She asks if she's ever going to be able to talk about her job with him. He tells her to give it a shot.

He asks her for a favor. She checks that it's not to have sex with him and his fiancée. No. He asks her to be his best man. That should be some bachelor party."

She decides to go wedding present shopping. She flirts with the salesman. Off the clock.

She realizes if she's not working she'll have to find something else to occupy her time. More importantly, she'll have to start giving it away.

She wakes up the next morning, the salesman is still there. She says she doesn't normally do this kind of thing. He asks what she does. Night time legal secretary. He says he could lay there all day. She offers to make breakfast, but has only champagne and olives. Her one night stand checks out her loft, it's full of oils and lotions. She calls Ben, needing a way to get rid of the one night stand who's missing the ""one night"" part.

He confronts her in the kitchen, thinking he's found her out. Says she's not really a legal secretary, she's a masseuse. She goes with it. He still won't leave. The doorbell rings.

It's Ben. He introduces himself as Hannah's fiancé. A good friend. Who towers over the guy like a hungry dog. The salesman finally leaves. She tells Ben she can't help it, she's not someone who can do a normal job. She misses the work. He pays up the bet. Jokes about something he found out about her, something gross.

She suggests perhaps someone who's about to get married shouldn't be getting paid to have sex. He tries to convince her. He gives her the ""let someone in"" pitch, swears he can handle it.

They do some prep work, waxing his chest. He watches her elaborate preparation ritual, pestering her. He wants to know how much she made last year. 105,000 pounds. You could knock him over with a feather, he makes about only a third of that. But she has many expenses. Make-up, phone bills, booze, nibbles, mattresses.

She says she worked it out once, it costs her 20 grand a year to do what she does. For him, it's just a few quid. They're ready for the clients.

Ben and Belle say they've been together for eight. Talking about college education, Ben goes too far, pretends, and makes an embarrassing mistake by naming the wrong university, which remains hanging in the air.

You can almost see the dollar signs in her eyes.

She might be high class, but there's a level above her. The courtesans. They only have a few clients, but they earn a fortune. Even in hooking, there are opportunities for career advancement. She really wants to be one.

She meets Della. Belle's nervous. Three women sit with her. They look over the samples of her wardrobe that she brought. They ask her age. She says 24. Della tells her clients who want a companion for three weeks want someone who's more mature, has something to talk about. Did she say 24? She meant 27.

Stephanie glares, but gives her a receipt for Belle's final week of work.

Ben buys her a cactus as a house warming gift.

At the top of her profession she's now completely in charge. She sorts through the applicants, meeting with them.

Mitchell stops by. He offers her advice, asking how many men she has lined up. Four so far. He tells her the fewer she has, the more prestigious she is. He asks her to go away with him to Scotland.

He compliments her, tells her she's capable of a lot more. Not that she wants to be saved from her career choice. Then he leaves on a business call, leaving Belle alone and bored in rainy Scotland, blowing off Ben.

Mitchell works, Belle wants to be entertained. She tries to play with him, shoving aside his cell phone when work calls. He's not amused. He has no sense of humor.

Belle calls Della, wondering if the girls ever get together. She's finding being a kept woman isn't as entertaining as she'd hoped.

She calls Ben over in the middle of the night because she's bored. Once there, he talks to his fiancée on the phone. Belle calls out, on purpose, asking what he wants to drink. Vanessa, on the other end, hears her. Ben points out that of course his fiancée is wondering what he's doing with Hannah at midnight. She knows they're close. At his wedding, Hannah will give her toast and every person in the room will be wondering why he isn't marrying her, Ben says.

Another day, Mitchell comes by. He's greeted by a note. ""I'm sorry Mitch, it's not for me. B""

Back in her old apartment, she works on a new Web page. She's going to be an independent escort. She doesn't want to be a paid wife. Ben offers to be her security. She asks if that'd be a problem with Vanessa. He's called off the wedding. Don't worry, he doesn't want to marry Hannah. But he realized he doesn't want to marry Vanessa either.

Hannah's mom calls, invites them both to dinner.

She brings the season full-circle: ""That's the thing. In London you can keep secrets, you can be anonymous, you can be whoever you want. But as long as one person knows you entirely and loves you still, it's the best place in the world."""

Arthur tells the viewers that babies do some dopey things, but then adds that ""we were all babies once"" before giving a few examples: his friend Buster who ate unpaid-for food in the grocery store, Mr. Ratburn who drew numbers on the wall at home, and even Jane and David. Arthur notes that even Kate is growing up, and says he already misses the days when she was a cute little baby. But D.W. argues with him, saying that he actually doesn't. Arthur says he does, and D.W. replies that he didn't even like Kate when she was a newborn. ""Did too,"" Arthur replies. D.W. doesn't believe him, and says she remembers exactly what happened. -Title Card- Arthur and D.W. are playing a grape eating contest and she eats the last one when he tries to get it. David calls them to come to him and Jane, who announces that they are going to have a baby. While D.W. is excited about this, David told Arthur that it will be six months before the baby comes. He gets nervous because of his friends telling him what could happen after the baby is born. At gym, Binky tells Arthur that he ""better get some clothespins; babies never stop pooping"" before he starts laughing. Arthur then imagines the baby has a dirty diaper while at the dinner table; Arthur then asks his parents to open a window. When Jane asks ""What?"" Arthur repeats ""I said can we please open a window!"" A fire truck drives by; the smell of the baby's diaper makes the firefighters cover their noses.
Buster tells Arthur that he will forget about hanging out with his friends after school and will have to babysit. Francine tells Arthur that he will start talking baby talk all the time. Arthur imagines that he is at football practice, and he catches the pass, but is tackled by Binky. The coach rushes over to tell him he made a great catch, but then asks if he's OK; Arthur responds to him in a baby voice that he ""Got a stinky diaper."" A foul smell fills the air, and everyone holds their noses in disgust. The entire team and the coach starts laughing at him. Francine berates Arthur, saying that he ""Still uses diapers"" A muffled fart is heard.
Binky then complains that Arthur ""just pooped himself even more "" - causing Arthur to glare back at them.
At the swimming pool, Muffy tells Arthur that in a few months, he would be changing all of the baby's dirty diapers. At that point, Muffy leaps right into the pool, briefly causing water to splash onto the entire screen.
Arthur imagines changing dirty diapers. He holds his nose as he disposes of the diaper. The baby then proceeds to fill the new diaper. Arthur complains that he can't breathe because of the stink, and rushes to open a window and air out the room.
Arthur says no to everyone in his nightmare. Jane comes into his room and asks him if he's all right, as he was tossing and turning. He tells her that he was having a dream, and she thinks he is excited as she is about the baby coming. The next day, he tells Buster that the baby is almost here. When one mom with triplets walks past them, Buster asks him, ""What if your mom has more than one?"" He daydreams that there are ten babies in the same room with him, one by one the babies began to fill their diapers which makes him scream. When he gets home, D.W. and Jane are in the living room. D.W. wants to show him how to diaper a baby by showing him her diapered dolls including his Bionic Bunny. He doesn't like that and scolds her for doing it. Jane shows them the videos of them when they were babies. The first one is Arthur at age one and learning how to walk. Jane tells him that he was a cute baby. ""What went wrong?"" D.W. asks until her baby video comes on and she initially looks surprised, saying ""That's me?"" Then, D.W. tells Jane that she hopes the new baby will be just like her, and Arthur replies that that's what he's afraid of. Jane is packing her suitcase and tells Arthur that she is ready to go to the hospital at any time now. D.W. gives her a picture of her so that she will have something to look at there. The next day, Arthur and D.W. are racing to the bottom of the stairs. She claims she won; he says it was a tie. She laughs and heads to the kitchen. He follows until he spots Grandma Thora making blueberry pancakes. ""Grandma Thora, you're in the wrong house,"" D.W. says. Arthur asks her where their parents and she tells them that they are at the hospital and they both have a new baby sister. D.W. is excited and does cartwheels. Arthur is not. At the hospital, they meet their new sister, Kate. The next day, Jane and David bring Kate home. Arthur is happy, but she often cries every time he gets near her. One day, Jane leaves him in charge of Kate. When he gives her her pacifier, D.W. warns him that it is dirty, making Kate cry. D.W. cleans it and puts it in Kate's mouth, silencing her. Then the doorbell rings; it's Buster and Francine. D.W. lets them see Kate peacefully asleep, but all of a sudden, she spits out her pacifier and cries. D.W. tries to feed her her bottle, but she still cries. A foul smell fills the room and D.W. goes to get a clean diaper. Meanwhile, Arthur pats Kate on the back numerous times until she poops. This act bonds them; she kisses him on the cheek as her way of thanking him, which everyone watches in happiness.

D.W.'s Baby:

The episode starts off with Arthur watching videos of his and D.W.'s first birthdays; Arthur sneezed out his candle and got cake in his mother's face, while D.W. waved out her candle while asking for her presents. D.W. films Arthur during Kate's birthday. He gets annoyed when she lies upside down to film him. D.W. jokes she's trying to make Arthur look more interesting, but it's hopeless. When filming Kate, D.W. claims that little sisters are more interesting than brothers. Arthur points out that she didn't always feel that way and reminds D.W. of what happened when Kate first came home from the hospital.

Title Card

D.W. is excited about being an older sister (especially since her new sibling is a girl), to the extent of yelling and jumping in excitement upon Kate's arrival and stalking her sister's every move, including listening to her sleeping. However, she becomes frustrated when her parents won't let her help with the baby, even though D.W. (at least in her own opinion) is a ""baby expert."" D.W. is also impatient about Kate sleeping so much. Nadine advises her to give her parents time, since grown-ups are ""slow-learners"".

When Jane has to go grab something from upstairs and asks Arthur to keep an eye on Kate, Nadine tells her that this is her chance to show her mom how much of a ""baby expert"" she is. D.W. intervenes to sterilize Kate's pacifier. After Buster and Francine come over to check out the new baby, Kate starts crying. D.W. tries to take charge and comfort her, but nothing's working. D.W. notices a foul smell and says ""P.U.!"" Before she hands Kate over to Arthur to get a clean diaper, Arthur ends up helping her poop (the real reason she was crying). When Jane comes in to see what all the commotion was about, Buster explains what happened and everyone's happy that Arthur and Kate have finally bonded--everyone except D.W., that is.

D.W. becomes jealous when her parents let Arthur help with the baby but not her, though she gets excited when Kate's crib is moved into her room. However, D.W. soon finds that sharing a room with Kate will be a lot stinkier than she thought.

D.W. is in the middle of a tea party with her dolls when she detects another unpleasant odor. ""P.U.!"" she exclaims, wrinkling her nose before going to investigate the source. To her dismay, D.W. finds her mother, Jane, and baby Kate in the corner of the room. It becomes apparent that Kate is the source of the smell. D.W. holds her nose and compares the smell in the room to that of a daycare. She quickly runs towards the window for fresh air, but before she reaches it, Jane unexpectedly fills her diaper. D.W. says that it smells even worse, before waving her hand in front of her nose and gagging. To her surprise, D.W. notices that even her doll is ""pooping"" its diaper. Disgusted, she frantically waves her hand over her nose and gags even more.

The next day, D.W. is playing in her room when she notices an unpleasant odor once again. She complains to her mom, saying that Kate needs a diaper change. But Jane just stands in the doorway, filling her own diaper. D.W. can't stand the smell and runs out of the room, screaming, while clutching an air freshener.

The following morning, Jane is feeding Kate when Kate lets out a fills her diaper. Jane congratulates her, but then she herself fills her own diaper. Jane then yells at D.W. to eat her cereal, but D.W. refuses, saying, as the smell has ruined her appetite.

D.W. seeks advice from her friends at the sandbox. They suggest she gets rid of Kate, but D.W. explains that her parents like her. When asked if Kate has ever done anything bad, D.W. complains that all Kate does is poop and stink up the house. Her friends are disgusted by this, and just as they're discussing it, Jane and Kate walk by. Jane has an accident, and the kids hold their noses. D.W.'s friends suggest that she frame Kate.

The next day, as D.W., Jane, and Kate pass by a demolition site, D.W. tries to frame Kate. However, Jane explains that it was just a demolition machine before filling her diaper. D.W., lost in her thoughts, accidentally walks right into the seat of Jane's diaper. D.W. is grossed out. But Jane presses her dirty diaper against D.W.'s face and has another accident, releasing even more foul smells. Jane even sits on D.W. and lets out a loud fart in her face. The smell becomes so overpowering that even Jane has to hold her nose.

The next day, D.W. is confronted by her father about his shoes being in the dishwasher. D.W. blames Kate for it, but her father sends her to her room.

Feeling upset, D.W.'s imaginary friend, Nadine, appears to console her. However, the smell is too much for Nadine, and she holds her nose, and complains about the smell. D.W. laments that she's out of options. The girls are suddenly hit with the lingering odor of Kate's most recent dirty diaper. Both girls hold their noses and exclaim, ""P.U.!""

The next day, at a garage sale, D.W. tries to sell Kate to an elderly neighbor, but her plan fails. The neighbor informs Jane, who comes over and fills her diaper in D.W.'s face before sending her inside.

D.W. is watching TV and sees a special on monkeys. She gets the idea to run away to a nearby island and convinces her grandmother to drive her there. On the way, her grandmother mentions how Kate will now have to look up to Arthur. D.W. suddenly realizes the error of her ways and demands that her grandmother take her home.

Upon returning home, D.W. is greeted by a frantic Jane, who expresses her worry for not being able to find her. Ignoring her mother, D.W. picks up Kate and reassures her, saying that she will teach her everything because that's what big sisters are for. Kate giggles, and just as D.W. holds her at arm's length, she detects a familiar stench.

D.W. winces in disgust, before turning her head away from the smell. She reminds Kate, ""Mommies and Daddies change all the diapers."""

Meanwhile, Mr Garrison struggles with his inner feelings regarding Kathie Lee Gifford, who upstaged him at a school talent show when he was little, by doing a presentation using two dummies instead of one. Eventually, Mr Hat convinces Mr Garrison to kill her.

Noting Cartman's 'body size,' the Mayor recommends he get in shape. However, Cartman assumes he isn't bulked up enough, and begins to take a concoction called 'Weight Gain 4000.'

Finally, the day arrives for Kathie Lee to arrive in town.

However, the media don't care as Kathie Lee Gifford has left.

In the aftermath, Cartman does get to be on TV, appearing on Geraldo after growing so big that he can't get out of his room after consuming more of the Weight Gain 4000."
